# PEFT-U: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for User Personalization at Scale

This repository consists of the code and data for the paper Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for User Personalization at Scale. In this work we explore the problem of personalizing LLMs to support user centered tasks where the preference of users' can potentially differ for the same input. Conventional LLMs focus on having one model to support all users, we emprically analyze the use of prompting LLMs vs tuning and compartmentalizing user-level knowlege for personalized tasks.



Python version `3.10.9`.
