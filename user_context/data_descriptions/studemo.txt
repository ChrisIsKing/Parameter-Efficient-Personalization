StudEmo (Ngo et al., 2022) comprises 5K customer reviews annotated by 25 people for 10 emotion dimensions: eight emotion dimensions from Plutchik’s model plus valence and arousal. Valence has an intensity range of [−3,+3] whereas each remaining category has a range of [0,3]. We treat the problem as multi-class classification where we keep categories with intensity value ≥ 1 as positive labels.
