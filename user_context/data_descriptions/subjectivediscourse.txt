Subjective Discourse (Ferracane et al., 2021) consists of 1,000 question-response pairs from 20 witness testimonials in U.S. congressional hearings. The study collects subjective interpretations from the crowdsource workers about the conversations on three aspects: the question, the response, and an explanation. In particular, the annotator provides subjective assessments of the conversation acts and communicative intents of the responses, forming 6 response labels. Each annotator also rates their sentiment toward the politicians and the witness on a 7-point scale. We leverage the response labels, and the sentiments toward the politicians and witnesses to form 3 dataset versions. To construct the text part, we join (question speaker detail, question text, response speaker detail, response text) by newlines.
