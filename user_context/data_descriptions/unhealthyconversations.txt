UnhealthyConversations (Price et al., 2020) consists of 44K comments labeled by crowdsource workers as either “healthy” or “unhealthy”. It also contains six potentially unhealthy sub-attributes: (1) hostile; (2) antagonistic, insulting, provocative, or trolling; (3) dismissive; (4) condescending or patronizing; (5) sarcastic; and/or (6) an unfair generalization. We only consider the top-level binary classification of healthy conversations.
