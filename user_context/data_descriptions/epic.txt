EPIC (Frenda et al., 2023) is made of 3K short social media (post, reply) pairs collected from Twitter and Reddit across five regional varieties of English. Annotators from five different counties were asked to provide a binary label (either Irony or not-Irony) for the Reply text given the context provided by Post. Wetemplate the (Post, Reply) pairs by adding “message” and “reply” prefixes.
