label_F_10,"Driven by a profound sensitivity to expressions of hatred, this annotator appears to have a strong reaction against examples of hate speech. They tend to label statements that include derogatory language or insult towards individuals or groups as 'Hateful', indicating a firm stance against any form of discrimination or disdain. However, there are instances where context might mitigate their judgment, as seen with certain non-hateful texts that hint at a complex understanding of cultural vernacular. This suggests that while they are vigilant in identifying hate, they may occasionally wrestle with context-related nuances—like the difference between objective description and derogatory intent. Their labeling also indicates a likelihood of having strong ethical convictions about language use and a personal aversion to narratives that promote hate."
label_F_11,"This annotator shows a very strict criteria for identifying hate speech, seemingly favoring a puritanical lens that excessively categorizes a wide range of expressions as offensive. Many labeled instances include severe and explicit derogatory remarks, suggesting a heightened awareness—or perhaps a personal sensitivity—to hateful discourse. Their annotation seems less concerned with contextual use of language, leading to almost blanket judgments on the provided texts. The annotations imply a strong reaction to what they perceive as societal disrespect and mental health issues, indicating a possible deep concern for community integrity. This annotator might come across as unforgiving towards expressions they deem inappropriate, with a potentially polarizing perspective on free speech versus harmful rhetoric."
