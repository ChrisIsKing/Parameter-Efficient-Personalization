0,"I had contact with an e-mail sexologist. He read em on the website sexologist.org.pl that you can ask an individual question to a sexologist by e-mail . After three days, he received em to explain the disturbing topics, and then for additional questions in the second e-mail . It was for one fee but not for the doctor, only the account of Anna Dymna Foundation for the disabled. We had to pay SAMEMU and send evidence to the doctor. I did not meet them on the Internet so that a sexologist would do the job and the ""cash"" would go to a Christian target. In view of the frequent human rapacity, this must be given. I don't need a sexologist anymore, because I've only had a few news items. The sexologist did not have the tendency to ""create a patient"" but reassured me. I think it is worth recommending a doctor with social characteristics, working also selflessly."
1,"I am almost 3 weeks after the ear correction procedure. Treatment in an extremely pleasant atmosphere (I note that all kinds of knocking and picking in the body I usually hysterically endure). Mr. Doctor and the nurse are talking, not thinking at all about what's happening. The anesthesia without much excitement (the dentist is worse), you just have to get used to the strange sounds right behind your ear. After the procedure itself, you will have two days of nervous sleep in the back: ) There is something that hurts (everyone has a different tolerance for pain), but some ""ordinary"" painkillers are enough. It hurts a little bit, just like when you predict the ears. The Doctor answers all the questions and explains everything patiently, even after three times, if necessary, because a man under stress sometimes does not record the first message. After removing the stitches and ventilating the ears you can start a new life, which I warmly recommend. I know that for the final effect you have to wait a little bit longer (the ears a little ""go away"" from the head, because until then they are very glued to it, the wound will heal for several more weeks). but you can see that it's worth it. In my life I have not watched so many tutorials with hair pinning, because after 30 years I can finally tie them up and go out to people. With a clear conscience I recommend dr . Hungarians."
2,"She noted that Polpharma is also a beneficiary of several grants awarded by the National Centre for Research and Development. ""The effectiveness in reaching out in an ambitious and difficult grant procedure is also a proof that our companies will be able to compete with Western European companies"" - she added. She pointed out that ""Poland is increasingly often chosen by global biotechnology players due to the quality of its employees, IT specialists and biotechnologists. During the briefing the old man jokingly admitted that ""it's a bit crazy, what the company is planning"" . The company informed that so far, it has spent about $1.5 billion on investments in the biotechnology sector. PLN 700 million. In the following years it plans to spend on the development of products as well as research and production infrastructure. 1, 3 billion PLN . The company's total investments of PLN 2 billion in the biotechnology sector by 2022 are to enable the creation of approx. 800 jobs and contribute to the development of the Polish knowledge-based economy ."
3,"It's the second time I've come to the same place: ) great peaceful climate and breathtaking views from the balconies: ) as far as getting to Zakopane by the guest house is concerned, there is a bus stop which goes to the centre of Zakopane and about 200 m in the other direction is PKL gubałówka. Of course, the bus is much cheaper: the only disadvantage is the lack of any shop but there is a place to eat, walk. I recommend ; )"
4,"""As we know, there are still no proper drugs against neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is believed that the possible aim of these drugs would be precisely protein quality control systems,"" states Dr. Pokrzywa. Potential therapies could, for example, stimulate the activity of quality control systems or help them to quickly find and precisely remove damaged proteins, which should not be in the cell at a given time. However, before this happens, we first need to understand the process of protein degradation. Among other things, this is what the research group led by Wojciech Pokrywa is doing. Thanks to a grant recently awarded by the European Organisation for Molecular Biology (EMBO), they are investigating how quality control systems recognise proteins that should be degraded."
5,"Hotel in the city center . Very tight underground parking . For larger cars there is a general parking lot in the courtyard, unfortunately, in the evening there are no places. The hotel is located on the 1st floor of the building. On the ground floor there is a restaurant . In the attic, probably on the 3rd or 4th floor there are 3 more apartments. But to luxury they are far away. The hotel room is narrow and high. The window overlooks the wall of the building and the car park. But there is no noise from the street. The decor is modest. A little sad. There is a table, a kettle, instant coffee, tea. Two chairs. Pretty comfortable bed. I lived in a 2-person room alone. When the water in the next room was turned off, the pipes were hissing terribly. Through the door to the hallway, you could hear everything from the outside. A phone call at the reception desk, guest calls at the elevator and unbearable morning loud comments from the cleaning staff. At the reception desk the ladies had a rallying point unfortunately. In the rooms next door it's terribly disturbing. Breakfast is modest but sufficient. Tasty weddings, cheese. Hot steamers, scrambled eggs, pasta with vegetables. But we got a sour vegetable salad and omelette with completely burnt black vegetable stuffing. The staff try to be very helpful. Although the arrangements with one shift at the reception are not sustained by another shift. I'll look for another hotel next time."
6,"A couple of years ago, the doctor was treating me. Undoubtedly, she has a lot of knowledge in her field, but the approach to the patient is shameful. At first she thought that maybe the doctor has a bad day - it happens. Unfortunately, after a few meetings she convinced me that this disrespectful treatment is the norm. No respect for the patient (while doing the allergic tests she came up with the idea that this is a good time to improve her makeup - she started to paint herself with lipstick by the mirror in my presence! ) . During the visits she did not feel listened to me, but rather completely ignored. Arrogant, for a penny of feeling and culture. Apart from that she gets very easily angry with ordinary questions and answers in a malicious way. The contact with this lady was the worst meeting with a doctor in my life. I sincerely advise against it! She used the services of Medicover ."
7,"Massacre from beginning to end: 1) no cosmetics in the bathroom 2) 700 people at breakfast and 2 coffee machines ( queue for 20 minutes ) 3) reception "" dead "" . Nobody answers the phones, you can ask, threaten, as a result nothing works, nobody can anything 4) in the "" 5 star "" hotel we have an empty bar in the room. As a result you can't even drink water, which is standard for a hotel. . . 5 ) the question why this is so is only one answer: we know that it is like this. . . 6 ) the waste of time for the next point . . . To sum up, as it is emphasized at the reception desk, the prices are SHERATON from Sopot and standards from Ustka . Write out paint, Polish galimatias in the worst edition . But it all depends on what you like anyway. . . I like an honest approach to the customer. Here we got 'em service at 2 stars, and they paid us for 5 stars. The advantages are also: parking for 30 zloty a day (added to the price of the room, apartment) and a large swimming pool ; - )"
8,"The doctor is rude and seems offended. But that is the least of the problems. Misdiagnoses, treatment completely misguided . On Wednesday and Friday - according to the doctor - ""nothing can be heard, nothing can be seen"" - so lipomalous and patting. And on Saturday afternoon the child is taken to the hospital with high temperature of congestion and dyspnea - diagnosis: acute pneumonia, acute bronchitis with obstruction, acute bilateral ear infections with purulent exudate! ! ! The doctors in the hospital could not believe that the day before that the child was in a pediatrician! ! !"
9,A very pleasant place worth recommending . The impression on the entrance itself is made by the hotel interior. I'll probably come back here. Near the old town where you can go for a walk and full of pubs and restaurants around. It's just a pity that the hotel bar was closed so quickly and a few guests were still sitting.
10,"I definitely do NOT recommend it. For a period of 2 months we left more than 3 thousand zlotys for a series of completely unnecessary studies, all the time I heard that my pregnancy is in danger and that he is saving my child - quote here: before natural selection. As he told me that the bacterium that I have is deadly, something has been in my head and thanks to the help of a kind person we found another doctor - Tomasz Lipinski, who I highly recommend. Generally it's not about the money, but about all the fear and the medicine we've been through, not knowing what really happens to the little one. It's a shame, because I think I have the professional knowledge. Lewandowski has, only definitely abuses it, not caring about his patients but only about the wealth of his own wallet. I DISCOURAGE"
11,"I recommend helpful, nice, student friendly, no problem, you can easily pass the ppl making cards (you can take a little jerk off) usually the basic concepts of the instruction nothing fancy"
12,"It's a nice hotel without a bump. The stay with 2 children was very successful. The hotel is very well located - access to the beach through the forest, close by. To the center of the town ok . 20 minutes walk. The food is very good, but not many suggestions for vegan. The swimming pool and the spa centre were very good for both children and adults. A bit of a poor playroom, but there was a pool with balls, so we do not complain. There are 2 disadvantages when leaving with the children: No outdoor playground and no lunches, you have to wait until 5 pm for lunch and you had to do some combination with the kids. Besides, it's a revelation."
13,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Dr. . Ruins. . . Lured by the internet star rating from the beginning, she did not have such confidence and this awareness that she came to the doctor who will listen to me and help with my ailments. Unfortunately, my intuition worked out 100% despite my sincere desire. A visit is expensive because 200 zloty for 5 minutes of conversation is absurd for me. A quick, superficial diagnosis would seem to be the same cure for everything and everyone suffers from the same thing. At least in my eyes the diagnosis also depends largely on the initial interview with the patient. At least then you know what is going on, for example, or what has been messed up in my case. She paid m 200 zl for the drugs. . And nothing helped or even worsened my physical and mental condition. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this gentleman, but maybe it is me who is special or this situation just happened to me. . . For a wrong diagnosis, high price of the visit and the assigned drugs, not counting the white deer and for suffering for 2 weeks and worsening of the skin condition. Greetings to the Dog. Dr. is very nice - in plus ."
14,"Not looking at the price of the set is ok but the prices went very sharply. When you spill on the floor it is a Tiny handful of bricks of which 90% are standard LEGO bricks. The set is not worth the price . 80% of the cost of the bricks is a license paid for Disney . Licenses + taxes . This set in the USA $79 but already in England £99 in Poland almost £500 . This applies to all sets with LEGO STAR WARS from the new series - for a few bricks and a license we pay 350 - 600 PLN . Not too big but only for small / medium sets. The problem is that children want it . The BB8 robot figurine itself, consisting of TWO ! Bricks cost 22 pounds outside the set and in Poland 120 PLN . Paranoia . Basket of an ordinary lego figurine is about 12 . The cost of people from the old Star Wars series is about 20 - 25 PLN . And Kylo Ren from the new series is 100 PLN (small man of the lego with a sword) . I am sorry that we pay so much for the license. Full grazing large set of LEGO firehouse with two fire trucks, people and buildings costs half the price of a modest set of Star Wars from the new series."
15,"Scientists have pointed out the effects of cannabidiol in the treatment of epilepsy. Vice President of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Pharmacologist Prof . Stanisław Czuczwar noticed that cannabidiol has practically no addictive effect and has no psychotic effects. ""Spicing cannabidiol + mouth + marijuana makes no sense,"" he said. Czuczwar referred to studies on the use of cannabidiol as a supplement to antiepileptic drugs in children and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy: "" 44% of the patients surveyed reacted at least by reducing the number of seizures by 50% . "" . In his opinion this is a very good result . However, he pointed out that the tests that have been carried out so far were small - they were carried out on several dozen patients and the tests lasted only a few months. Meanwhile, in the case of epilepsy drugs, long-term effects are very important. And in this respect the tests have not yet been conducted. Prof . Jerzy Vetulani from the Institute of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Krakow pointed out that due to social phobias, objective, large-scale research on the therapeutic effects of cannabis is very difficult to carry out. ""I cannot find an ethics committee in most countries that would agree that 3,000 people could regularly receive drugs for two to three months (marijuana-based, PAP),"" said the researcher."
16,"The building is beautiful, magnificent, located on a pedestrian promenade right next to the park. Unfortunately, terribly neglected and fatally managed . Everything to renovate and replace! In the room a TV set from the eighties of the last century . The swimming pool too, and already access to it and the cloakroom complex makes you feel like in a hospital and not in a hotel. . . The only plus is the cleanliness"
17,"The main prize and first place for the representatives of the foreign medical centre was awarded by the Society of American Military Orthopaedists for the first time in its 58th year of history,"" stressed SOMOS chairman Lt. Mark Slabaugh at Friday's meeting. The work of the Polish people was one of the approx. The work of Poles was one of approximately 40 evaluated in the annual competition. During the press conference WIM representatives emphasized that the conference participants were mainly specialists from the USA and guests from leading orthopaedic centres in Canada, Norway, Israel and Great Britain. The participation of Poles in the conference allowed them to establish direct contacts with representatives of similar medical centres - including Walter Reed Centre in Washington, D.C., Central Air Medicine Centre in Colorado Springs (USA) and Central Military Hospital in Trondheim (Norway) ."
18,"While visiting Kazimierz Dolny decided to stay with their family not in a hotel but in a country cottage. The choice fell on Zagrodowa Osada in Uściąż (5 km from Kazimierz Dolny). Typical rural climate, away from the noise of the ""town"" where children can commune with nature, feed animals (rabbits, ducks), play with cats, dogs and ride a horse. I recommend learning horseback riding, the owner has a lot of patience and devotes a lot of time. prices very reasonable (25 zł / half an hour) owner, passionate, very nice and helpful woman. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Very good, nutritious country breakfast. Definitely recommend for a short trip to Kazimierz. If you stay longer, a little bored. . . . .but, well, we are in the countryside. . . . . .a happy village, a peaceful village. . . . . ."
19,"They booked us a room for a Saturday/Sunday night. Unfortunately, no one informed us that we would be having a wedding. I was. We didn't sleep the whole night. We arrived after a 300 km trip to a place about. 21 . 00, so there was no chance of us withdrawing from the accommodation proposal. The next day, the driver took part in the competition. And then another 300 kilometers home. A tragic weekend. And it was supposed to be so beautiful. Besides, a room without air conditioning. With the window closed, you can suffocate yourself, and when we opened the window, there was a car ""refrigerator with catering"" just below us. so some kind of aggregate would turn on and off. When we went to see the beach, we suddenly felt a terrible stink. When we went down to the beach, there was a TOYTOYE (probably not cleaned for a long time). A nightmare. And one more thing, ambiguous information about the room rate - different information from two different people working at the reception. Of course I have a lesson to learn that everything should be confirmed, at least by email."

21,"She used the hotel for the second time with the promotion of the price of accommodation - 39 or 49 PLN. I think that then the price is adequate to the quality. However, right from the beginning I have to mention that the whole hotel is 'squeaking'. It's like the sound of old CRT TVs or some smartphone apps that are used to produce high-frequency annoying sounds for the ears. This sound is steady with second intervals, I don't know if it's any air conditioning or any fire protection but unfortunately it's very annoying to the ears. From the plus point of view I can replace a pretty big bed, roller blinds blocking the window, so you can get some more sleep in the morning and various lights. The maids clean the room every day and change the bed linen With some worse things, as for me cushions are not cushions but something rectangular and la cushions are not sleeping, a little support is needed ; - ) The table underneath the TV is a little tiny, but it's fine. It's a shame that there's only one outlet next to the TV. There is also no bigger wardrobe or even a shelf to put things on. The shower is coeducational, i.e. transparent, completely basic but sufficient. It is also a pity that the towel is only one per person. For the price of 50 PLN it is a really affordable option not far from the center, so if I have to appear there again, I will definitely do it ; - )"
22,"The access is very poor, far from the city centre. There are no plates informing about room numbers in the building. The rooms are dirty, cobwebs, plaster falling off, stains on the walls, balcony door broken (they stick on one hinge), no hot water at night, fungal showers. In a bowling alley, slats on tracks fall off, very little space, ping-pong pallets are the same planks. . . . a billiard set is also not complete, in the pool ice water, in the jacuzzi there were only jets in 2 places, ceilings in the corridor in the recreation area glued on a grey tape! ! The restaurant is not adapted for the disabled. The owners are focused on the cash register, make the stay difficult, do not invest in the object. For everything you have to pay extra, we waited for an hour until someone comes to light a bonfire - finally came the lady who announced that she can not do it. . . . I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!"
23,"In one fell swoop 43 hotels with 5,400 rooms operating under the Grand City Hotel brand in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands will take over the brands belonging to the Wyndham Hotel Group ( WHG ), the largest hotel group in the world in terms of the number of facilities (not rooms!). Under the partnership agreement concluded between Grand City Hotel ( GCH ), the second largest hotel management company in Germany, and WHG, as many as 43 hotels, out of 120 GCH portico facilities, will adopt the brands of the American group. The Wyndham Grand brand will be taken over by 5 hotels, Wyndham 3 hotels, Wyndham Garden 10 hotels, TRYP by Wyndham 17 hotels and Days Inn 8 hotels. 33 hotels will be rebranded by 1 March 2013. and the rest in the next two years."
24,"Perfectly designed and constructed object! Simply divine design and for that reason I will come here again. Besides, great food served in a beautiful restaurant, excellent spa and fantastic service. Prices for accommodation in such a place seem ridiculously low!"
25,"As for a hotel taking about 700 pln for an overnight stay in the season, the gym is neglected. Nice service, but what if a lot of the equipment ""drifted"" . They work, but in this class of hotel, should be better. Look at the pictures. Next note: I bought a pass for 10 entries ( weekly stay ) mainly because they started with 8. 00, unfortunately, after the weekend, I was informed that they will only be open from 9 . 00 , not nice ! Besides, there is only one air conditioning system, I think the central air conditioning system is either too expensive or not working. Such a grandfathering, and room prices, as per location, are high. No straight back muscle training bench."
26,"When I first stopped there, I had some concerns about the quality of this facility. When you enter a room, it turns out that the rooms are not inferior to very good * * * hotels . The rooms are neat, clean and quite large. The restaurant, well, you can eat. I have the impression that they use too much chemistry for cooking and the dishes are heated up: ( On the plus side very nice and helpful service :) Generally for the hotel the rating is very good and for the restaurant at most average."

28,"I highly recommend Mrs. Dr. Jędrzejczak as a good professional and at the same time a nice and kind person for the patient. After several dozen years of struggling with diseases, my father accidentally came to her and finally started to be properly treated. It is only a pity that so late, because many of the lesions could not be reversed, and those sick years, the stress and struggle - sometimes for life - can no longer be erased from his memory. And it's a pity that my mother didn't live to see it anymore, because those years of worries and care for her father probably shortened her life. For almost 6 years I went to various doctors with my ailments which were becoming more and more serious and everyone was spreading their hands. She experienced a lot of annoyance and even humiliation in doctors' offices, when I was already treated as a bully or a person with mental problems, they shouted at me and got rid of me. She spent quite a lot of money on private visits, paid examinations. One visit to Dr. Jędrzejczak and a thorough interview (how important it is for the doctor to listen to the patient and, of course, to have knowledge) were enough. She was referred for a few examinations and that was enough to find the cause of my ailments. Why didn't any of the doctors think about it before? There was no willingness or knowledge? ? ? I don't know. The most important thing is that I'm finally being treated properly. That would be so much from me about Dr. Jędrzejczak. And one more thing: I don't know how the ward, which is headed by the doctor. Because I'm not interested in it and that's not what this site is about. We judge the doctor here, and I judge that very well."
29,"The visit went quite smoothly, the doctor checked the results of the tests, made a factual interview and determined the treatment. In addition, the doctor recommended that the tests be carried out without a referral (a referral from the doctor is required to perform the test), although during the visit it was suggested to me. Currently the contact with the doctor is quite limited and I do not know if he will give me a referral for the tests he recommended me to do without an appointment for a paid visit. From this point of view it looks weak. Greetings Matthew"
30,"This facility has the best times behind it. The rooms definitely need refreshing . The cleanliness was not perfect but it was possible to survive. The hotel is worth attention because of its attractive price, but the standard leaves much to be desired. Apparently it is WiFi but I have not managed to connect. Noteworthy are very good breakfasts in this class."
31,"It is true that she is a very nice and tactful woman who explains everything thoroughly and answers every question. In the beginning she was very pleased with me, but she stopped going to her because with each subsequent visit she felt more and more disposed of me. My visit (I will mention that always private, for which she paid me as for a normal visit) lasted 5 minutes and consisted of writing a prescription. . . The doctor didn't do anything to me and it was like that from 3 visits in a row. I don't think this is how a visit should look like even for a fund, let alone when you pay a lot of money for it. I was very disappointed with it. . . ."
32,"An ordinary seaside resort. Although the website is professionally made, the resort itself does not delight. Standard rooms, nicely furnished but very small. For two people it may be, but for a family with a child it is definitely too cramped. Once you have unfolded the armchair on which the third person sleeps, you cannot open the balcony door, so you have to fold the armchair to the balcony during the day. Smoking on balconies is forbidden - a fine of 100 PLN. The water in the warm bathroom, if someone likes it more than warm, it will simply freeze in the shower. There are no kettles in the rooms and you cannot have your own, because of the electrical installation - words of the receptionist. Room card (key) only one and you can't get another one. The food is very good, very large selection of everything. Very nice ladies waitresses and very nice cleaning ladies. Dinner consisting of two dishes, served to the table. It is not possible to exchange for another dish - if there are served, for example, offal, it is not possible to exchange for anything else. If you don't like something, you just don't eat your dinner - that's the solution of the receptionist, with whom I talked about it. Your receptionist absolutely requires training in the culture of guest service, and the importance of the reception - the business card of the hotel / facility. I recommend to the owner. A playground with modest, dirty sand in the sandbox. High stairs to the beach . To sum up - as I wrote at the beginning - an ordinary small resort. The price was overstated in relation to the quality of services provided, I will certainly not return there. Generally I do not recommend ."
33,"He only met him yesterday. My first intuition was. . : The calendar of rates and availability, as well as the methodology of their introduction have definitely changed. Interestingly, there is no longer any Booking Button functionality available, which played the role of a booking engine for the hotel website. All the more so because recently it was possible to use it without paying any commission. This is where the answer can be the Booking Suite introduced on 5 January by the giant owned by Priceline . It was created on the basis of a previously purchased interactive agency for buuteeq hotels. It provided hotels with comprehensive digtial marketing and e-commerce solutions: website, booking engine, channel manager, advertising campaigns. In a word, everything related to the presence of hotels in the Internet."
34,"A doctor thrown into the poor framework of Polish health care . TOTAL LACK OF VOCATION ! ! ! ! LACK OF SENSITIVITY . Probably if m had paid 200 PLN (and could have paid em during the visit to the hospital) it would have moved her and probably after the spirometry and allergic examinations the doctor would have at least looked at the results and yes ... . . She didn't even look at the results, whether I have asthma or not. It was March - I only have ailments in April - and she wanted to treat me in May! ! FUNNY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! IT'S COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION! ! ! ! I ADVISE YOU NOT TO GO IN PRIVATE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! BUT NOT FROM HER. ! ! ! !"
35,"The hotel is perfect for me and my 14-year-old son. A lot of attractions, it is hard to get bored - we visited the zoo, sealarium, rope park, Blucher bunkers in Ustka - all in a holiday package! A pleasant, quiet and clean room with a view of the park - a revelation! Excellent food. Bowling, ping-pong, unlimited access to the pool. Excellent treatments and massages. Also noteworthy is the discreet and extremely helpful service. We have not missed anything, total relaxation and wonderful time spent with the child. Recommended for families with children. But it is also an object with a rock claw - the stars performing here are world-famous, min . Santana or ZZ TOP etc. Amphitheatre is impressive. So it is worthwhile to get interested in the offer of the hotel, and even more - just go to the Charlotte Valley. I recommend it warmly, with a clear conscience: )"
36,"10 years ago, Franke bought 'em a sink. Looks almost the same. The old model has more extended chambers and the triggers are not centrally placed . After experience with the previous sink, now they bought the same sink too . Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. They do not write this in the information, but this sink has no overflow hole and it is not possible to close the second sink with a plug! ! ! There is only a strainer. The whole thing is clearly devastating compared to the previous one. One only plug also has a changed construction and I do not believe that it will last as much as the old one."
37,"I have many reservations about Dr. Turowska. She does not devote too much time to her patients, during the visit she receives private phone calls, she is unpleasant and sometimes biting. One can get the impression that she treats women from above. In case of complications she will not give detailed information on her own, you have to ask her questions or leave her office with uncertainty and fears. The proof that she does not take her patients seriously is the fact that nobody was willing to inform me that on the day she was scheduled to visit me, Dr. Turowska would not be able to reach Yelenia on time because of the conference - supposedly she could not reach Yelenia on time because the ""train was delayed"" (I doubt that with such charges for a private visit Mrs. Turowska travels by train. . . ) As a result, she wasted my time unnecessarily to go twice for a visit / Well, despite everything that she wrote to me, I have to admit that, anyway, Dr. Turowska is an expert and her recommendations have always been effective. However, the discomfort she felt in her presence made her resign from her services in the 7th month of pregnancy."
38,"The hotel should be called a failure. The room we got so terrible that I had to pay 100 euros for the change and also on the same quality but from the side of the beach with a nice garden, previously the employees lived in these rooms so it proves something, food so bad that my daughter ate all 9 days in town, the only plus is a lady smiling in the bar All Inclusiv, generally German geriatrics and Russian kindergarten, Sozopol charming, especially the old town but small and neglected, view from the terrace beautiful but medium swimming pool. If this is one of the better hotels then I wouldn't want to see the worse ones, in Sunny Beach much better standard. We've been to Sunny Beach a couple of times and it's the worst trip. I know, I know, I know someone would say cheap and in general it's only Bulgaria but in other places it's better and besides, not so cheap at all, I would rather say expensive. I don't recommend Sozopol at all, unless it's a day trip. The advantages are still Stefan the waiter in the old town and Matthew from the shop at Matthew's on the promenade. AAA and a pizza, made by the young guys in the beachside boudoir, really good, my daughter tasted very much: ) ) )"
39,"I guess it's okay, but it's ""but."" First, what I did not like: - For breakfast instead of juices, artificially sweetened drinks are served, - handling a little stiff as if someone nonstop looking at their hands, - in the windows very blowing which does not give you sleep. And now what I liked: - despite the small size of the mattress was comfortable and I slept well, - delicious food, salad Caesar world championship - very pleasant bathrooms - despite everything, service on a very good level. Will I come back? Just for the salad, but for sure."
40,"Within a dozen or so months from the end of Euro 2012 the number of accommodation facilities put up for sale may increase by at least half.

It all depends on the state of the Polish economy, i.e. the domestic demand for accommodation, the pace of transactions concluded or the withdrawal of offers for sale of facilities, and then on a possible increase in the number of foreign tourists. Among the sales offers present on the market, uncategorized facilities with up to 30 rooms at a price lower than PLN 5 million dominate. An operating and fully equipped several-room guesthouse can be purchased for several hundred thousand zlotys."
41,"I sincerely recommend ! Mrs. Kasia creates a great, warm atmosphere in which you can easily throw everything out of yourself and not be afraid to be judged or instructed. An oasis of peace, compassion and wisdom - she can listen for a dozen or so minutes just to briefly sum up the patient's outburst in two or three sentences, let her understand that she understands and ""feels"" what's going on, and then, in the next sentence, pay attention to things that immediately stimulate thinking and change. I went to her a little stressed out, but from the beginning of the visit she had a sense of being in professional and above all good hands: )"
42,"Plusy - large swimming pool - wooded, quiet neighborhood - tasty food - courteous service Minusy - far from the sea (to the ugly beach about 600 m, to the nicer about 1 km) . - mushroom and moisture in the room and bathroom - paid bath towels in the pool - if you did not go for a meal at the beginning of it, what better food was missing later on"
43,"Apartments really well equipped, clean, neatly without mushrooms and walking vermin. The hotel service is very nice and helpful. The downside is that everything in the hotel is extremely well carried. You can hear literally everything, not to mention the maids who cleaned the neighboring apartments making such a noise as if the building was collapsing. And the breakfast. . . . .tragedy. Every day the same thing. Canned fruit and the cheapest iceberg lettuce served for breakfast in a hotel in Portugal is very poor."
44,"Prices from 70 to 125 euros . The cost of accommodation from 8 to 9 June 2012 . The only free apartment in this period is 1980 zł. Regardless of whether the owners of such apartments will earn for Euro 2012 or not, it still seems that they will come out at the party winners. Euro 2012 will certainly contribute to the popularization of this type of facilities - primarily among the compatriots, because foreign guests know well about many of them - and if the owners do not take a penny earlier to equip their facilities, they can gain not only publicity, but also regular customers."
45,"This hotel is the best example that the company is created by people. Even the best company, the best hotel can recommend on staff. In the first evening, the service in the restaurant was very poor, but in the second sance, the restaurant worked thanks to your manager, perhaps Mr. Marcin? at 100%. Fantastic service, fantastic food and fantastic wine. Since we were with our dog, we were offered a separate lodge and everything was at the highest level. The service at the reception was also very pleasant and very helpful. The hotel was clean. Only at night the staircase stairs did not turn on the light and ripped off my ankle tendons as I fell down the stairs. I can recommend this hotel as much as possible."
46,"A perfect hotel. Nice service, clean rooms, fresh linen, possibility to take the teapot to your room, very good breakfasts, gentlemen at the reception desk charming: ) A huge plus for the dryer and basic cosmetics in the bathroom and the phone. Location great, close to the center, next to the fitness center and the gas station. High standard . Nothing to add, nothing to put into words."

Researchers will be asking for research in a particular area, and the provider of information, i.e. medical data, can be anyone. If they want to provide them, they will be able to choose the scientific project they want to support. The platform will be connected to it via e.g. a smartphone, smartphone or smart wristband. With the user's consent and for the selected period of time, the system will record the body's work (heartbeat, number of steps taken, sleep quality, glucose level, etc.). ) and you will receive a fee for providing your data. Examples of benefits, which may be brought by the platform in a long-term perspective by its creators include e.g. prediction of asthma attack when going to a specific region (and thus taking preventive actions), detection of heart defect or prediction of sugar or other substances in the body. They also include studies of the efficacy of given drugs or therapies, e.g. by comparing health data before and after the initiation of the therapy. A potential benefit in the future could be a reduction in health care costs."
48,"One of the few doctors who deserves a positive entry on this page. A competent cardiologist , specialist not only in his field of rhythm disorders and ablation , trustworthy and above all committed to what he does . I was referred to a doctor when I was diagnosed with a congenital electrical impulse conduction disorder ""WPW"" at the age of 46. She was terrified to read on the internet about the ablation which I was directed to, all the more so because my WPW was appearing and disappearing, which meant that the procedure would not bring a positive outcome. From the moment of the first visit to the procedure she did not feel any fear of performing the ablation and eliminating the defect in my heart, because the doctor with his confidence in the strength of his skills gave me a sense of security and faith that I am in good hands. I recommend the doctor to all patients who have ablation before them because every patient deserves a good, trustworthy doctor. I recommend"
49,"In addition to the typical cavities, I treated the doctor's tooth with root canal. It turned out that I had a very long one root and the task was difficult. But the doctor is patient and very attentive to details, he does everything thoroughly and under a microscope. Despite the tiredness he tells jokes: ) Luckily, he's moderate, so that he doesn't snort laughter with the drill in his mouth :) He always explains what happened to the tooth, what he does and how to take care of it later. This guy is really passionate and you can see that this is his vocation. I'm also a specialist, only in another profession, so the specialist will immediately recognize it :) You can ask for everything and even watch something under a microscope. I sincerely recommend : )"
50,"I recommend the Podklasztorze Hotel as a place for both family recreation and corporate events. On September 12th I had the pleasure to participate in a company event organized in this hotel. Nice and professional service, delicious food and the unique atmosphere of the historic walls made everyone have a great time."
51,"Very modern hotel operating from autumn 2014 Beautiful architecture gently inscribing the object in the shoreline of the lake. The service at the highest level . Very good breakfasts that pay attention to healthy eating - an element very rare . Excellent Wi - Fi . Very nice and suitable size pool almost connected to the lake . Spa - well - probably the weakest point . It is not bad, but in relation to the level of the whole object - there is some detail missing (or maybe I had bad luck) . Nevertheless, one of the prettiest and lowest objects in which em was recently . There are not many such places in Europe . And the tables of the restaurant ""entering"" the lake are priceless. What's interesting, it's all for very reasonable prices. I hope that nothing will change because it will certainly be one of the most visited places I highly recommend!"
52,"From outside, a beautiful, wooden, historic building. Inside it is climatic, although some elements of the decor look very poor (a sofa in the hall). The first clash appeared when the lady apologized for the smell on the staircase - they disinfected the room ( ? ! !) and did not manage to ventilate it. In combination with the later readings about bed bugs in mattresses, it made me afraid that I would get up all bitten by the vermin. A double room with a small bathroom, single beds, a bathroom renovation saw 20 years ago. It's hard, it's important that the bath and hot water; but for 120zl something like that, really? Breakfast included - bread, butter, cheese, tinned ham, marmalade, cereal and milk. The service is not very pleasant and pleasant, nor is it very splashing. It was just a little bit. Maybe the dormitories are better, but when it comes to two, it's a big disappointment. It is definitely not 8. 2 on tripadvisor."
53,"assessment: a pass mark can be taken: The exam can not cope with the students still her noise and conversations in the hall, she is a little bit out of tune when she says that something will not be and so she will prepare the college as she likes on the second wheel I got the task from the beginning of the lectures which was obligatory on 1 college general is not a bad task does not give some sophisticated and difficult you have to prepare a little bit, but the ease as for me I passed in the exam: )"
54,"New hotel, clean, quiet location (October 17) and that would be enough. Hour . 3 : 55 at night, the door to the room opens and someone enters while we sleep. . . In the morning, I report the situation to the manager, and then you find that your friend made a mistake at night and assigned our room to a new person (you really had to work hard to hit a busy room when the hotel was almost empty). We ended our stay at the hotel on an unsleepy and stressful night before the long journey home, and the only compensation from the hotel management was ""sweet sorry"". On top of that, our proximity cards were already blocked twice at the hour. 9 : 00 on the day of departure ."
55,"Standard room 10 - 15m2 quite small. Clean and ergonomic . What is surprising is the lack of clear separation of the sleeping area from the shower and the washbasin - they are in the form of a cabin about 1,5 meters from the bed. Inside the shower is spacious and comfortable. There is air conditioning. The desk is not comfortable to work. WIFI works. The bed and the elderly man as if on spikes in the hospital ; ) No wardrobe - there are two pairs of hangers each. Bedding is clean, mattress is comfortable, not soft. Just a budget offer for one top two nights. A matter of decision, certainly people with claustrophobia should not go there. Breakfast is a standard for this type of hotels - scrambled eggs, bread, accessories - is fine. In front of the hotel a large parking lot."
56,"She's been on Alle inclusive holidays since 26 . 09 . 13 - 03 . 10 . 2013 r . I cannot recommend this place because it is very neglected . Dirty pools , Jacuzzi cries out for vengeance to the sky and ants in the rooms . While taking a shower, you can flood the room, because instead of the shower tray there is only the floor and a low-key bar. A neglected beach is said to be afraid of places, and this probably means in Greece that nobody and nobody there cleans up. The food is so hopeless that it is a pity to say the words. Still in a circle the same thing that was left one day, the other was in the omelette and so to puke, we had to eat out. Not a single olive and fish as a medicine. In a mini supermarket emptiness and the saleswoman drinks vodka with a friend. To the city 10 minutes away by taxi for 10 euros another option is missing. The playground is half closed, and the aquapark is a mockery, one slide and it's up such a hill that the child has trouble entering. The staff for everything had an explanation for the end of the season . I DO NOT RECOMMEND"
57,"He bought 'em two pieces ( one for a colleague ) from an official distributor. The two new alcohol machines measured incorrectly: one or even two beers each indicated 0 . 0 . He sent em to the distributor's service with a complaint . The service rejected the complaint, calibrated it using the only free calibration (according to the free calibration program) and returned it at my expense. After calibration it works properly . To sum up: newly purchased device can be recalibrated . The warranty claims are stubbornly rejected, despite correspondence and argumentation. Screwing out: the sensor is not covered by warranty does not appeal to me. If it had been recalibrated after 3-6 months as described in the manual (and even faster with intensive use) it would have nothing to complain about. My opinion about such a product and service attitude together with the seller can only be one : TRAGEDIA ."
58,"Hello Ariston washing machines are too loud! ! ! ! ! ! ! The first washing machine advertised em replaced all the components one by one until they finally replaced the whole washing machine. The new washing machine was also too loud, so I advertised it, they replaced the engine, after which nothing changed. ! ! ! ! ! ! The technician unfortunately found that the washing machine goes well on his ear! ! ! ! ! and on my neighbors' ears, this washing machine goes too loudly for the effect of a plane taking off! ! ! ! ! ! a total failure I do NOT recommend! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
59,"As for the condition of the hotel itself : 3 / 5 - most of the metal / chrome elements in both the room and the pool is rusty - it takes the charm away from the whole place - loudspeakers on the pool with a mushroom - fuck, but as I pointed out to 'em from the moment I entered the pool, I don't know where the eyes of the people who manage the building have - a small canteen - but it's nice, quiet and cozy As for the food : 3 / 5 - no drinks for lunch - indescribable food - found 'em food piers in cereal at breakfast . . . Service: 5 / 5 - no reservations Generally recommended for a weekend outing ."
60,"Planned stay in this hotel with friends was pleasant until we came to check out. They booked us in the hotel two suites, making the reservation chose 2 adults and 2 children, the number of such suites two, which gives us a total of 4 adults and 4 children, unfortunately, as it turned out that the reservation system divided people so that in one suite included two adults, in the other two children and the other people were not visible in the reservation. What's more funny, since the other people were not included in the reservation, why the price of both apartments was the same for both two and four people. The hotel manager said I was right that the system made a mistake and should include 2 adults and 2 children in each room but it happened differently and she has no influence on it and thus we have to pay 900 PLN for the lack of people in the reservation. It is also surprising that on the day of arrival no one noticed that more people arrived than in the reservation. I understand that there are errors in the room reservation systems and so it was this time, however, expected em from a 5 star hotel to do things differently and not to charge guests not a small amount of money by system error. The hotel only loses customers and I have just become one of those customers."
61,"The hotel is not the latest, but you can see that it is well maintained and refurbished. It is located on the main street in Alanya, very close to all sorts of cafes and bars, 7 minutes to the train which takes you to the hill where the ruins of the castle are located, very popular with tourists and one of the popular caves of Damlataş. The hotel is also located on Cleopatra beach (the most popular beach on the Turkish riviera). The rooms are not too big, but everyone has air conditioning, which can be easily controlled. The rooms are cleaned daily. Balcony with sea view room . As for the meals, everything was fresh, varied products for breakfast, dinner rich in various local meals (She was there with her husband, who comes from Turkey, said that the cooks cook very regional dishes belonging to this place. ALL FURNITURE! I'm writing this because the knife in my pocket opened when she read my previous reviews of the food, I suspect the guests were expecting caviar and gold for a small price. The staff is nice, the manager at the reception desk is friendly, he will help you with advice, he will give you a hint, the gentleman taking care of the pool bar is very nice, speaking 3 languages, with great care for the guests. The hotel's swimming pool is clean, separated for smaller children. The hotel had its own sun loungers on the beach, which could be rented for only 10TL or less than 10zl for the whole day, as well as a friendly staff taking care of the loungers and guests. The only thing she could stick to is the fact that the fridge in the room cools very poorly, and finding a free deckchair by the pool in the morning borders on a miracle because some guests leave their things there to take care of the deckchair at a later time, and sometimes even by the pool do not appear, but it is rather not the fault of the hotel and the mentality of some guests. The overall rating is 6, cheap, the hotel is well looked after, the food is good, the service is nice, the location is great. WE RECOMMEND"
62,"Initially I was satisfied with the visits to the doctor's office, but the last visit makes me look for another gynaecologist. The doctor told me that my husband and I have been trying unsuccessfully for a year and that it is not an infertility clinic. She also did not carry out any tests and did not advise where to look for help. She only recommended me a dietary supplement. . . I do not recommend this doctor to people who have any problems - it is a waste of your time."
63,"There's only one way to describe it - it was OSZUST AND STRIKE I went to him for almost two years on laser hair removal - when after that time she decided that there was no effect - he first told me to do a testosterone test (which I already thought was nonsense - to ask why she didn't start with such a test - if the result was of any importance to success - he said , that he didn't want to expose me to additional costs without the need (testosterone test - 30 - 40 PLN - each visit to him 10 times more) the test showed a result at the lower end of the norm - to which the ""doctor"" changed the tone - and found that I guess I'm abnormal if I thought that he would guarantee me that there would be any effect. Apart from that there was no respect for the patient - about the fact that he was going to be late for the visit, or not at all, she found out in front of the office door."
64,"Mrs. Marta conducted the interview very carefully and meticulously. She expected me to discuss deeply what can cause chronic pain, but she didn't live to see me. You had to ask because not everything was clear. Mrs. Marta did a very good massage, although she wouldn't tell me that after two or three days, my strength came back and the pain was reduced. Apart from the massage relaxing the muscles, she didn't find out many interesting things that she hoped for. Plus: warmth in the office; minus: no relaxing music."
65,"The first impression is not the best because of the surroundings. Once you cross the threshold of the hotel is only better. The service is extremely courteous, nice but not artificially only so naturally friendly. I really appreciate places where people do not work as a punishment and because they want and like what they do. The room is tiny but clean and maintained consistently in the style of the whole hotel. The restaurant is cosily furnished . Nobody asked us out even though it was already theoretically closed. Breakfast is very tasty and varied. It found for itself egg paste, fish paste, vegetables, juice. For those who traditionally prefer breakfasts were ham, scrambled eggs or sausages."
66,"The hotel stopped in the mid-1990s. It doesn't care about the client, it has five problems, it's not a front to the client. The guest feels uncomfortable, guarded and at every step he feels unfriendly to the staff. The terrace is closed after 22 . 00 and in the morning, despite requests if you can have breakfast there, the manager informs you that the hotel policy is that it is not slow, the food is average and prices are high. The swimming pool is filled with chlorine until it is hard to endure, no bathrobes because they are in the laundry, over a night light net and spider, no fridge in the room. The morning is a noise of cleaning and steps over the rooms because the walls are too thin. Definitely not recommended at this price."
67,"Nice atmosphere, quiet and clean. Very close to the nearby office buildings, so a perfect place for people on a business trip. Also close to the airport. Plus there are two types of cushions to choose from in the room, a tea/coffee set and a general order. The minus is a rather modest breakfast in the restaurant buffet. However, I think that you can recommend this place for those looking for a quick accommodation in the delegation or on a journey through Warsaw airport."
68,"Room booked by booking . com, upon arrival at the place the object is closed, nobody opens! ! ! contract phone call to the facility is off! ! ! There is no way to stay overnight ! ! He probably rented it to the Germans! and there is no room for Poles. After a phone call from booking.com, we found out that, in Croatia, this is the standard, that they cheat Poles, prefer to rent to the Germans! ! !"

On their way to the holiday they decide to visit Clark's cousin Eddie. The Griswolds leave the host with an extra passenger, Aunt Edna, to be taken to Arizona. When Aunt Edna dies, the Griswolds decide to take her to Arizona anyway. When the family arrives in California after many adventures, the park is closed.

71,"I thought everything was fine. Admittedly, while trying to suck blood from my ear, it darkened in my eyes and until the end of the day, instead of candy, I was eating painkillers, but the diagnosis was apparently correct, because after a few days from the visit is much better ;) Greetings"
72,"The cooperation with the Novotel team can be summarized in a short statement: professionalism combined with cordiality. During the training, combined with business talks in the restaurant, accommodation and securing the entire technical facilities, I met with full support at every stage of the event. The commitment, flexibility and creativity of the staff contributed to the success of the whole event. And that's why they decided to organize another event in Novotel at . Wyścigowa Street in Wrocław . So it remains for me to thank you, especially Ms. Magda and wish you further success. . ."
73,"After many unpleasant examinations in proctologists I was recommended to Dr. Skoczylas. And finally I found me a competent doctor who cares for the patient even during the examination ensuring his intimacy. ( which I had not experienced before with proctologists ) . This year, in October, she trusted m dr Skoczylas and underwent surgery, which I do not regret. Probably now I will not need support and treatment, but I recommend it to anyone who has proctological and gastrological problems of Dr. Skoczylas. And if he will propose the surgery it is worth to trust. A calm, calm man and a great specialist."
74,"Hotel in a very good location, beautiful sea views, you can enjoy all inclusive in the entire complex of all hotels except Royal Castle. The lifts actually work poorly but we lived on the 3rd floor so you could quickly go up the stairs. The food is very good, the choice of huge delicious cheeses, aubergines, fresh vegetables, delicious pickled herrings and mosquito nets, meat in various forms also grilled. If someone there is hungry and doesn't find anything for himself it is probably abnormal. There are a few disadvantages but this is Bulgaria so you have to get used to, if someone is a Parisian dog then I do not recommend it. The alcohols are pouring without limits but be careful because it can be hard on the other day. Lots of fun and animation for children, discos, etc ."

76,"She was a patient of this lady for a few years. As far as one-time check-ups to a healthy person are concerned, I have no objections. It is worse if we have a problem, some ailment we have to deal with and we expect help, Dr Szymborska is not the best choice. For several months I have been struggling with a painful infection / inflammation and the visits have not brought any help, it has been a month and I have not been understood, it has not been explained to me what exactly is, what can be the cause and how the doctor can help me. At this point she changed my doctor because I still feel bad and want to be cured, and the next visit to your doctor would be a waste of time and money, not to mention your health. The atmosphere is not nice, it is not neutral either, after fasting it did not feel comfortable."
77,"University Clinical Hospital is in good financial condition. As the director of this facility, Dr Bogusław Poniatowski, informed the hospital has no debts. However, the university and the director of the hospital are already thinking about the future financing of the hospital. It is known that after completion of the investment the current costs of its maintenance will significantly increase. The hospital hopes that the NFZ will take this into account in future contracts, because for the time being it is the Fund that is the main source of financing the hospital's activities. ""For example, the new hospital building will need an annual amount of electricity equal to the needs of the approximately 20,000th district town"" - emphasises Director Poniatowski . ""Whereas the heating of the airstrip will cost about 150 PLN per hour"" - added Vice-Rector Mariak ."
78,"As she evaluated, the project carried out in the hospital is conducive to the doctors' reflection on how to communicate with the patient. She emphasized that doctors may lack the knowledge about effective ways of communication, because in the process of education it is not a very emphasized aspect of doctor's work. ""After our first meeting with linguists there was some resistance on the part of doctors to the fact that someone would call, judge what I say to the patient, maybe they were afraid of criticism. However, it is important to talk to the patient in such a way as to be satisfied, to get what he wanted out of the visit. My participation in this project has led me to be more patient, especially when dealing with the most difficult patients,"" she said."
79,"The hotel is located about 150 m from the sandy and rocky beach (I recommend to take your shoes to the water), to the center of the village about. 2 km . Close to the supermarket where you can do shopping. The hotel itself is very nice and clean. Towels and bed linen changed daily, the food is very tasty and very much. Breakfast is monotonous, but lunches and dinners are rarely repeated. In the all inclusive option you can use the a'la carte restaurant. I must add that all inclusive is on a very high level! ! ! Animators are fine, they entertain the guests very cool: ) The staff speaks Polish . The only downside is the main guests - Russians - lack of culture, rudeness, they take full plates and then throw away half of the food. Despite this, the holiday is very successful and the hotel is really worth recommending! ! !"
80,"Very good base for all fly fishing enthusiasts. . . .very nice people. Licenses can be bought on the spot and breakfasts which are tasty and very large can be ordered at any early time, which is important when leaving e.g. before 6 am. The rooms are rather small but the area is beautiful. In the restaurant local cuisine and a little Italian. . prices very good ."
81,"We will remember our stay at the Jeravi Hotel from the not very good and monotonous food - potatoes and chicken mostly, morning reservations of deckchairs at the pool, beaches in 90 % prv with the possibility of renting two deckchairs with umbrellas for 30 lions, other places on the beach are crowded. If someone will book a room is a better option with a pool view. Not all drinks are too free, coffee after lunch in plastic cups, animations mainly for children in Czech because more guests from the Czech Republic. To sum up the price of the stay is too high in relation to quality."
82,"There is a kindergarten at the hotel address. The hostel is very difficult to find even the people living next door are not able to indicate where it is. The hostel is not marked. The staff is not able to show the way to the hotel. Despite the fact that the reception desk was 24h, there was no one there. They do not have all rooms e.g. 2 - 3 people. Photos from retouching ."
83,"She suggested that I have a very good opinion and signed up for a visit, unfortunately I am disappointed. It was my first visit, so she asked me to check up and tell me how to proceed with the treatment. She also mentioned to me that sometimes I feel a slight pain on one side. The doctor didn't check all my teeth, she just immediately took care of the treatment of the tooth, which according to the x-ray could hurt. At the end she made an appointment for another visit, because in her opinion the tooth next to it is suitable for quick treatment, ""because you can see the caries with the naked eye"". The next day I went to another dentist, where it turned out that the indicated tooth is not broken at all, only the filling is already old, but there is no caries, and possible pain may result from hypersensitivity. In addition, a general review was carried out with information on what should be cured, it was also proposed to remove the tartar, which is what Mrs. Makowska expected me to do, but she did not receive it. ."
84,"There's no green idea about hormones because I was hit by a strong medication on my thyroid, I was supposed to have hypothyroidism, now I have hyperthyroidism. I was all over my medication, and I spent no more than 250 zloty plus 2 visits of 100 zloty each, plus travel expenses of 50 km. She gave me an appointment in 3 m, but after 2 weeks I realized that something was wrong. Of course I changed my doctor, she gave me the cure for my thyroid because I have hyperthyroidism. I warn everyone about this lady, she only takes the money and our health doesn't matter. I'm going to see this lady, I'm going to think of a bad diagnosis, I won't let it go."
85,"He was 'em with his family in the second half of October the beautiful weather temperatures above 25 degrees. The hotel consists of three parts Panorama is at most through which is quite a long way to the beach, go down you can come up walking can already create a problem. The hotel bus circulates every few minutes and this is a great convenience. Eating tasty European dishes as well as Greek cuisine is all delicious. The slides are open, the water in the pools is already cool. Every evening animations, mini disco for the little ones all had a great time. We were the last group of tourists from Poland at the end of the 2015 season it was clear that the Greek are preparing for winter. Stay on 5 + ."
86,"I was upset with this doctor. First he complained about the fact that he had too many patients in the National Health Fund that day, then he resented me for not going to see a rheumatologist privately. Based on one result of the initial examination he told me with a smile that it is certainly a very serious disease that will in time cover all the systems in the body. He was not eager to explain in more detail or to dispel my doubts. Mr. Tomasz gave me a referral only for some of the tests, after which he ordered me to go to a POZ doctor because it does not pay off."
87,"She stopped me in the comfort room. It's a nice room, although it's not some impressive size. The hotel is very cozy, everything is new and nicely maintained. The swimming pool is indeed tiny but well that is. The sauna and massage room is very much on top. Everything is maintained in exemplary cleanliness. There are beautiful views and tranquility all around. The service is helpful and smiling. Nice place for families and couples. I am very satisfied with my stay."
88,"I share Dr. Agrawal's opinion that poor nutrition and stress are the greatest dangers to the body's organism, as I have found out by going on a proper diet and I can see that there are few doctors who holistically look at humans. Dr. Agrawal made a very good impression on me at the beginning because of her positive energy and peace of mind, and she was enthusiastic about her recommendations, she took care of my health because her diagnosis was very convincing. However, she convinced me once again to be sensible to treat such methods as well. Unfortunately, the doctor made a wrong diagnosis - excess estrogen, which she decided to confirm with blood tests. It turned out that my hormones are normal. If I hadn't checked it, today I would have been lubricated with ointment with progesterone written down by the Doctor, but why? I am also not convinced to recommend the so-called 'em - these are beneficial bacteria (with a mixture of herbs), and as you know, such bacteria are needed in the intestines, so they must first pass through the stomach. Drinking such a liquid with bacteria, whether they are able to survive in the stomach - rather poor chances so I prefer to take the current market symbiotics in special capsules. However, I can see very good effects after the Sunny concoction (olive oil, alocite, lemon) prescribed by the doctor. Natural methods of treatment are great - but girls, be careful, complement this knowledge with simple research and your own intuition. I guess she would be afraid to entrust me with leading the pregnancy with the Doctor, unless I have another doctor at the same time. Although I agree with many things, I think it's all too much responsibility, and most of all, the doctor, who calls himself holistic, doesn't pay enough attention to one thing. It's all too chaotic, although a noble goal."
89,"I join the opinion of most of Dr. Bieniek's former / current clients who appreciate his craftsmanship and full professionalism. More than 2 years ago, my 7-year-old daughter had her dye marks removed by your doctor under local anesthesia. Good attitude of the doctor, professionally performed procedure, and now a nicely healed place. Today, again, my daughter was in the role of a patient, also with a mole, which was to be removed due to its progress (she did not previously have such a saturation with dye as now). This time, unfortunately, my daughter was very afraid, she resisted and finally - the surgery did not take place: (I absolutely understand that the doctor has an appointment and cannot afford to persuade or calm down for a long time, I also know that with a child who does not give a guarantee that he will be in motion, it is too risky to take surgical action. All this I understand. But. . . . . .after today's visit, I have a taste for the child, because it is too radical, too harsh and too judging. It's just that the doctor directly attributed his daughter to disobedience to the parent and attempts to manipulate her (that's how she perceived it). It is only that he did not know the history of his little patient, and it is a pity because in my opinion the patient should be approached individually. It so happens that the daughter, as for her 9-year life today, has had a lot of unpleasant experiences (7 hospital stays, 4 general anaesthetics, local anaesthetics and a number of minor but unpleasant experiences). I believe that she has justified grounds for fear and anxiety, besides being more insightful and imaginative with age. I lacked an empathic approach to the child. In the present situation I am ""in the dot"" and I even have concerns to try again and return to Dr. Bieniek. And I know I have to find a way to remove the birthmark. Last but not least, it is nice and commendable that the doctor did not take any money from us, even though it was as if he had not given us his precious time."
90,"Access to the hotel is easy, however, the location and car park signage itself is not acceptable especially in rainy weather. At the entrance to the hall in the gate you feel musty. Acoustic rooms, noise from the corridor can be heard. Breakfast is average in the background choral music - longer listening is tedious."
91,"Two nights, a comfortable bed, a clean room - in the bathroom, slight shortcomings in cleaning but without exaggeration. Towels and bed linen clean, nice service. Some of the furniture would need a light refreshment or a screw or two more. In our room there was just a trace of an iron on the carpet - you can see a man was here before us, such a curiosity.) The hotel without any craze but also without tragic conditions, so as for me very good value for money. The air conditioning is efficient. Generally I recommend."
92,"Mrs. Anna is a great specialist in the field of dietetics. After our first meeting, she knew I was in good hands : ) From the very beginning, Ms. Ania asked a lot of questions, she dispelled my doubts and solved all problems. The plan put forward by Ms. Anna exceeded my wildest expectations. The dishes introduced by Anna were not only healthy but most of all delicious. Moreover, Ms. Ania was constantly giving me new culinary ideas and new products, which so far she didn't know me, but which turned out to be a great success as far as my taste is concerned. What's more, Mrs. Anna is a life optimist, she is able to remedy any situation and keep my spirit up. You could still write a lot about the way Anna is committed with all her heart to her work but I think that's not what this is about. If anyone needs advice on nutrition, I can assure you that she will meet your expectations."
93,"This is an adaptation of King's novel. Writer Mike Enslin, a skeptic about paranormal phenomena, travels around haunted hotels and describes what happens in them. Most often nothing interesting. One day he decides to spend the night at the Dolphin Hotel in room 1408, which has opinions of the haunted. Despite warnings from the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) he takes the keys and goes to the room. Nothing happens at first, but after a while, he he hears various noises, sees people who aren't actually there. From now on, nothing is as it seems."
94,"Not yet. . . In about two years' time, maybe Vista will be out of the game. But if there is a choice and you can give up the nerve damage on Vista. . . Everything is going in the right direction for sure safer more efficient and colorful all this however disappears as the scanner does not work for us or the performance on a newly purchased laptop is barely 3 , 0 . A good system, but not on the Polish market, where everything is pushed to sell. Let's be aware of what we are buying and we will certainly not be disappointed. In 2 years he will write opinions on YES."
95,"I absolutely discourage you! ! ! ! I've been to his place a few times, she's had hypothyroidism problems. Arrogant, he doesn't let the gentleman get to his word, but he should have listened to me, because I was the one who felt bad and had certain ailments. The worst thing he could do is to inform me, and I quote: ""Oh, please, I don't see any chance of giving birth to a child - the cactus will grow up when you get pregnant"" - I'll add that I'm 28 years old, the doctor told me that before the very wedding, for me it was a tragedy. It's a good thing that she quickly got my name on another endocrinologist and gynecologist who worked together all year long, their job was to help me get pregnant and I was to lead properly. Mr. Dr. Urbanski stated that my gynaecologist is stupid and doesn't know each other and is not a miracle worker to get me pregnant. I will add that the change of doctor with the medicine. Mr. Urbanski's change of doctor from medicine to another endocrinologist turned out to be the best decision in my life - I now have a 2 month old pretty daughter. . . . . . I'm afraid if she'd ever become my mother if I still believed everything Dr. Urbański said?"
96,"I judge the Doctor well because, just after the diagnosis, it turned out that my son is healthy. No treatment and the visit lasted 3 minutes, so it is difficult for me to express my competence. Nevertheless, the Doctor explained everything to us and reassured us. I think he has an attitude towards children."
97,"Unfortunately, I am not satisfied with my stay in the Best Western Krakow hotel, she spent two days there. This hotel chose me mainly because it had a sauna and swimming pool. When I arrived at the hotel to my surprise she found out that the swimming pool and sauna are being renovated, she expressed my dissatisfaction with this fact to which in response instead of apologizing she heard me say that ""no time is good for renovation"". Reservations were made well in advance, so there was time to inform me about a limited offer (no pool and sauna). In such a situation she would give up her stay in this hotel. She paid me for a hotel service which she did not receive, she would not have bought me a stay in this hotel knowing that I do not have the opportunity to use the swimming pool and sauna because the possibility of using these facilities was one of the basic conditions for choosing a hotel. To sum up, the offer of the hotel was not true because it contained services that the hotel did not provide. The hotel knew that it is not able to provide the guests with a swimming pool and sauna because such works as renovations are planned in advance and yet it deliberately offered and charged for these services which it was not able to perform. Not only that no one informed me that I will not be able to get what she paid me for, but it was not even considered appropriate to make an elementary ""sorry"". She feels cheated because she paid me for services she didn't get m . Margaret"
98,"The above mentioned stay is considered as Christmas only by name. . . one plus, as I am a woman, of all the downsides described in previous reviews, is such a thing - ""that I wasn't standing by my pots! ! ""and she came back from her stay a few kilos lighter because of the impossibility to hunt for anything to eat on the so called . . . buffets. In a word, MASAKRA and the hotel presents itself nicely and pleasantly only from the photos in the gallery, which attracts and at the same time attracts guests to unnecessarily spent money ! ! ! I ask all potential guests (only by name, because in the hotel you will no longer be them, but only intruders) to not give in to the magic of the photos and misleading price promotions - as my predecessor wrote, what is the price and unfortunately the quality of services, which are also promotional (but unfortunately not for the benefit of customers! ! ! !) . If you can completely spoil this beautiful holiday for someone, it is this place - that is, the staff, the owner who sometimes appeared in the hall and only chose the bartender money from the deal! ! ! - it was 100% successful. GOD SAVE ME FROM ANOTHER VISIT TO THE MANOR HOTEL. . . . . . ."
99,"I strongly advise against it! We went with our son who had a cold and went to see the paediatrician, who, as it turned out later, was also a homeopath. I wouldn't mind if it wasn't for the fact that after seeing the child your doctor said it was the beginning of the infection and suggested to us that we had a choice of either very heavy drugs in the guise of antibiotics or homeopathic remedies and prescribed us oscilococcinum + some homeopathic drops. Within 3 days, the son's condition deteriorated significantly and we had to call a doctor this time. The doctor told us to ignore the ""drugs"" prescribed by the doctor and prescribed the traditional drugs (and surprisingly not antibiotics) after which the kid recovered. The question is whether the son had to suffer for these 3 days without actually getting any medication and getting worse? Besides, I'm surprised that Damian, the clinic where Dr. Drzewiecka took us in, allows the doctor with a biased approach to homeopathy to take us as a pediatrician. I suggest that your doctor should continue to accept patients and even small ones, but as a homeopath and not a pediatrician - with full awareness of the patients or their parents, because with such blind faith in homeopathy as Dr. Drzewiecka's, this is not the best solution. I will add a small detail, which is much less important than the rest, but for the parents of small patients it is not without significance, namely, that Ms. Drzewiecka is spraying and unpleasant. To sum up, I can't find any advantage of visiting Mrs. Drzewiecka, so if we have a choice it is better to go to another pediatrician."
100,Your medicine . very nice and friendly. I was at her place with my daughter and she has an attitude towards children. She even gave her a small reward for being brave : ) We are undergoing treatment and the effects are already on + . Another visit is soon to be a good one and I am very pleased with your competence.
101,"The hotel is designed for longer stays with the family. There is a spa and pool. There is a big restaurant, not too big a menu, but it is a tasty food. Wi - fi at no extra charge throughout the building. Parking around the hotel is available at no extra charge, and it is large. The rooms are nice and big. I had to leave before breakfast started so I got 'em lunch-box at no extra charge. I recommend this hotel, but I have no idea what the summer availability looks like."
102,"I recommend that, even though I was with him only on two visits, when I was pregnant in the Bielany hospital, I wasn't treated by any chance ""oil"". On the contrary, in each of these two cases he examined me and asked me exactly how I felt and if something was bothering me, for me this is a novelty because there were doctors that I went to in private and the visits lasted maybe 2 minutes, without any tests or questions I left with a completed pregnancy booklet. . a complete mistake!"
103,"As the scientist described, when the atherosclerotic plaque ruptures, a blocking blood vessel clotting occurs. ""Our research has shown that oleacein effectively inhibits the inflammation that causes the breakdown of the atherosclerotic plaque. This is possible because oleacein can change the function of inflammatory macrophages - they start to secrete anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 . The plaque becomes stable - it does not crack. This is especially important for people with hypertension. Now there are about 9 million of them in Poland, in 2035 there may already be 16 million of them"" - explained the professor in an interview with PAP . On 20 June this year Polish researchers received an American patent for the use of oleacein . Soon - as prof . Naruszewicz - a European and Polish patent is to be granted."
104,"In Qubus , in Zielona Góra it was m twice. The location is great, almost in the city centre, it is close to everywhere. There is a hotel parking lot or a parking lot near the palm house, which is literally two steps away. The rooms are tidy, although you can still work on the cleanliness. The food in the restaurant, on the other hand, is excellent. We were served a delicious appetizer made of white cheese, probably goat's cheese and mead - sky in the mouth. Dinner was also delicious. We also ordered Lubuskie wine, which we liked very much. I think it is a great idea to promote local and Polish delicacies. Breakfast was also very good, a big choice, everything fresh and appetizing. Very nice all the hotel staff. Keep it up! I highly recommend."
105,"Unfortunately, my experience is not so positive. Unfortunately, the doctor was completely incapable of anesthetizing me, so the easy treatment turned into a nightmare for me and plowing on the fallow for her. Several approaches did not give the desired effect. She was very disappointed with it. I do not recommend!"
106,"Fantastic woman, you can immediately see that from the University and not from Polibuda :) Classes are held in a pleasant atmosphere, you can understand everything, it pays off before the class to take an interest in the tasks from the script and report to the exercises - translates into the final grade. It's hard not to score in the colloquia, especially if you ask politely in front of the circle what types of tasks will be and prepare yourself a suitable ""memory""."
107,"I'm confirming that Dr. Krajewski doesn't cure but operate. I'm going to see him so he can cure it senselessly. He's only set up for surgery, not treatment. He says so himself. So, if you go to see him, it's only to make an appointment for the surgery. But 300 zloty for a visit like this is quite a lot. I was also on a visit and she was hoping to help me with my problems, but he's only gonna do the surgery. So if someone is hoping to pay 300 zloty. and hear something different from him than other doctors say, he'll lose 300 zlotys. A friend of mine has had surgery on him and he is satisfied. My laryngologist also referred me to him for surgery. I have to think about it."
108,"just that they give one key for two people, bottom and seaweed breakfast - plastic, customer service - failure of lockable fridges - hahaha, PRL in French version, żenua . pl plus it in a regular warm room, and so much"
109,"The photos do not reflect the end of the hotel level. When I came in, my jaw fell to the ground. At the reception desk super people (if someone doesn't speak the language, they work there P . Karolina and Czeszka probably Zuza. Beautiful rooms, the food could have been better, but there was no tragedy either. Animations and animators are very friendly (there is also a Polish girl in the group Karolina will take * * * * and a girl) you can always talk to her and about everything. The neighborhood is calm, but if someone is not enough animation, you can go to a party at night to nearby clubs. I recommend, recommend and once again recommend a holiday in this place ."
110,"The hotel has met my expectations for comfort and convenience. Great location, very courteous service, both at the reception desk and the cleaning staff. It is a pity that just during my stay, there was no possibility to use the gym and SPA on site. However, a fantastic convenience on the part of the staff was to arrange a ride and a free spa stay in a second hotel from the Radisson chain. I will certainly want to come back here."
111,"You can't check in early. The reception desk didn't even check if there are any more rooms available (around12 ). Then, when we were second time in the hotel (around 18), it turned out that the hotel did not have our reservation and was not able to arrange a proper room (with a double bed) in return. Eventually, however, we stayed there because one of the guests turned into rooms with us. Long queues at the reception and not very nice lady. The rooms are poorly soundproofed. Besides, ok . Clean and quite spacious . They have a small TV and a kettle. Bathroom's okay. There's a hair dryer. Paid parking for the car . There is a smaller free parking lot next door. Generally the hotel is on the sidelines. There is not very much where to go out in the neighborhood - maybe apart from the shopping center ( Ikea Auchan etc ) . Tasty breakfast has saved some of the hotel's previous busts."
112,"I'm just listening through the ventilation grille to mixed conversations from the rooms above me. Generally he went to sleep with me, but these guests are arguing quite loudly. The room itself remembers my last visit in 2004. A failure. I need to talk to a friend who booked this. . . . .I blocked the check with a pillowcase. . . . .didn't help much, but always."
113,"Among the ok. 400 accommodation facilities for sale include three five-star Warsaw hotels. For 880 rooms in these hotels their owners can theoretically get about one billion zlotys, he finds out "" Hotelarstwo "" . One of the offered facilities is Bristol, which was bought by Royal Starman Bristol from Orbis SA for 19.5 million euro in 2011. The facility, after facelifting and entering the chain of The Luxury Collection, located higher than Le Meridien, can ""go"" for twice as much. Details soon."
114,"What if the hotel is new, nicely arranged, beautifully located, with a wonderful view of the lake, a nice restaurant, if: 1) tiny room, rather ""transitory"" than residential (hallway in the room); 2) in the bathroom a plate shower from the ceiling, no handset; 3) nice, large terraces, but divided ""optically"" by metre walls, so you can freely look in the windows of the neighbors; 4) supposedly there is air conditioning, but only in advertising folders - in fact, during the 35-degree heat in the room was 28-29 degrees! 5) without a break, a dozen or so times a day, the electricity was turned off - the phones were not working at that time, so you could not ask the reception, what is going on; 6) on the hotel premises, in the immediate vicinity, a pavement cube was laid; on Monday 3 VIII the workers woke up at 7. 17, releasing the slabs and rubble! Not only did they make noise, but also dust and clouds of sand were hovering over the construction site - wonderful conditions for rest; 7) cleaning ""on request"" - if a guest didn't post a card ""please clean"", the cleaner didn't even take out the garbage; 8) intervention with the ""director"" of the hotel was not very pleasant, because the guest was self-confident and arrogant; 9) ridiculous prices of ""unnecessary"" services - 50 zloty a day for a dog (but to be fair, I have to write that you can come to the restaurant with your dog, for breakfast or dinner). , sunbed rental 10 PLN per day , bike rental 10 PLN per hour . water bicycle rental 30 zł per hour . (in the town of 17 zł), motorboat rental 350 per hour plus gasoline (in the town of 100 zł, including gasoline!) NOTE! The hotel is focused on collective events (such as weddings, integration events) - let it take into account all those who are looking for a rest in silence!"
115,"In 2011 she had hallux removal operations. The foot was not corrected correctly . The ankle was still protruding ( only a little less ) . Even though the doctor was nice, you had to ask about everything. She didn't get any guidelines for any rehabilitation, check-ups or referrals for x-rays after surgery. The shoe also had a bad fit, because nobody told me what it was supposed to be like (as a result it was much too big, which supposedly did not fulfill its function at all - it did not relieve the burden of forefoot) After removing the orthopaedic shoe on my foot I walked very uncomfortable, which eventually led to a much bigger deformation than before the operation. At the moment I am 6 weeks after the second operation. This time I decided to go to a private clinic. Fortunately everything worked out and the leg is healthy. I still have to operate on my second leg (also hallux), but I will not use this doctor."
116,"Dr. Wilinski ran my pregnancy. The last ultrasound was done almost 2 months before the birth and despite my suggestions that the baby may be large (I have 158 cm) he did not repeat the test. The baby was born by cc, it was almost 4300 and 60 cm. There were clear indications for cc from the beginning. Not only because of the size of the baby, but also because of the bacteria detected in me. The effect was that the baby got infected and landed on neonatology on an antibiotic treatment, I got tired of it without any sense. And it could have been much worse. . . ."
117,"Well, Dr. Vodka is an exceptional man. He always helps, and if something doesn't work out for him it breaks down terribly and consults with prof. dr hab. inż. Walkowiak. He likes tasks with a short content, because those with a long history. . . are too long. I highly recommend to everyone who wants to experience an encounter with a man who loves chemistry, but has some problems with communicating this love. : : D It's all about exercise, because I didn't have the pleasure to be with him."
118,"She was m in Hyrnie out of season. Quiet atmosphere, few guests. A room not big - so to sleep - but with a view of the garden and the mountains. Tasty meals although not fancy. The waitresses were cool and acquainted with the regulars and the new ones were always up to date and willingly - ) At the reception desk - good service - I was positively handled seemingly - not to be handled (thanks). Fantastic location of the building and interesting design elements from the time - our - socialism. Spacious corridors, lobbies, rooms - a building designed on a grand scale. Glistening floors glistened and added shine. ."
119,"Mańka presented his achievement during the ""Investing in Medical Innovations"" congress in Katowice from Thursday to Friday. It is based on research conducted in Harvard in 2010. ""It was a study on whether it is possible to create a model using a polymer which, if we grow lung cells on it and subject them to the forces that are actually present in the human lung, in the actual alveoli, will start behaving as if they were behaving in the human lung. It has been proven that this was the first time in history that a completely artificially designed and artificially functioning human organ was created,"" said the PAP during the congress."

Ibis budget is primarily a practical and noncommittal brand. It guarantees basic values for guests who expect independence and authenticity. In the ibis and ibis budget Kraków Stare Miasto complex, Małgorzata Kalinowska-Klimek is the Managing Director.

121,"A few days ago we were driving through Poznan and stayed overnight in this hotel. We were surprised by the terribly high price of accommodation and breakfast but thought that these are the prices in Poland now. ( We are tourists living permanently in Canada ) . As for the money, the rooms are poorly equipped, I would say ugly. And without asking, we were given a stinking room for smokers. The ladies at the reception desk are not very polite either. Dinner at the restaurant is very expensive and cold. Rather not very tasty. I strongly advise against staying at the novotel. Asia."
122,"A beautiful modern hotel richly equipped with various attractions. Air-conditioned rooms, luxurious and tasteful bathrooms. Excellent cuisine with a very rich and original offer of dishes. For us, goose dumplings, fried ice cream were unique. The hotel building is located on a very large green area, a child-friendly place. After a pleasant and short walk through the forest you can reach a clearing on a large lake with a bridge. The place is very attractive as a base to visit, of course Lichenia, but also Gniezno, Kruszwica, Innowrocław, Żnina, Konina. I want to come back here"
123,"Hotel very pleasant clean . Close to the public beach with a walk of about 5min, the large swimming pool has never been a problem with a deckchair, by the pool bar. Very nice service always helpful and smiling. The restaurant is clean, the food is very good with lots of fruit and vegetables, hot dishes very tasty, lots of Turkish sweets. The room is not great but cozy. To the center of Antalya by bus about 15min. In the evenings various attractions are organized. We were with our daughter and we are both very happy with our stay."
124,"Dr. Kniażewski ran my second pregnancy, she was a bookie and no problems. Everything was ok until I got to the hospital. There, during his visit, Dr. Kniażewski talked only with the accompanying staff. Then the lady came to call my name without explaining anything and told me to go. She got me into the delivery room. The doctor looked in and told me that he would be in the library if someone was looking for him. You came to my delivery room with your medicine. med. Danuta Cekańska, for whom so widespread 'to give birth in human terms' is just a bedtime story. After the birth of almost 5kg of the baby - nobody gave me an ultrasound before the birth. For about 1 year. 5h Mrs. Dr. Cecca could not cope with the heavy bleeding. There was no end to the cleansing and the pain and fear accompanying them was unbearable, she heard me only do not jump and run away. The midwives were just nodding their heads and asking if they could give something p / pain, which they heard several times that it was over. Then for 2 hours she lay m with chills and a bag of ice on her belly in the hallway, good that the husband was with me. When she found me exhausted in the hall, Mrs. Dr. Doctor doing an evening visit, she saw my husband with me and went out indignant not interested in my condition. The great credit to this department deserves great recognition Mr. Nurses are angels and the whole neonatology team with Mrs. Dr. Pajek at the head there you can see the professionalism and wonderful care of the little ones. To sum up, if the ladies go to Dr. Kniażewski's private office, please do not count on the same care in the state ward managed by him."
125,"He would advise me to avoid places that do not respect their clients. My fiancée and I were planning to make a wedding there. In January 2015. . . .the restaurant was announced that the restaurant would be closed. Of course, we did not learn this from the owner/manager, but from the website. There was no information about the possibility of resuming business or cooperation again until the end of January. If the manager or any of the team is not able to make an effort to inform the people concerned by e-mail, can you count on them in other situations? I doubt it. In addition, the service is not very good, and the trashy decoration - the interwar twenty years ""perfectly"" harmonizes with the dirty tent (incidentally disfiguring the view of the Sołacki Pond by covering the historic facade) and plastic doors from the 90s. The restaurant is asking for a renovation and better lighting, because the atmosphere is not special there. This place is not even suitable for Christmas Eve."
126,"For thousands of years the situation has changed, but insects remain on the menu of many people in the world. There are several reasons for this. ""In some cases it's about a high sugar content. An example is the honey ants, which the Aborigines eat in large quantities. In addition, insects have a very high fat and protein content. Compared to meat, e.g. chicken, it is several times the value of what is found in poultry. Butterflies, beetles and even ordinary flies consist of 70 - 80% of protein,"" explained Dr. Jaskuła. In insects, a large concentration of various vitamins such as B and K vitamins is also important. ""Imagine that e.g. in wasps there is a much higher concentration of vitamins than in some fruits. What, by the way, one of the Japanese emperors Hirohito knew very well, who ate them and had them baked in special cakes,"" he said."
127,"The surroundings are beautiful, with a wonderful view from the window and infrastructure in the air (loungers, tables, bicycles for rent). The hotel itself loses the mouse - it would be useful to clean and overhaul the heater in the bathroom with scratches, the floor collapsed, sofas and dusty rustlers. The food in the restaurant is very fragile and expensive. The tables are standing so close together that it's hard to talk. The hotel certainly does not represent the level of 4 stars and it's a shame because it has huge potential."
128,"There are two layers of microflora on the skin of the hands. The first one is the proper physiological one, which is with the human being permanently, this microflora multiplies in the folds of the skin, in the hair follicles, in the sebaceous and sweat glands and it is it that ensures the proper functioning of the skin. It should not be removed. It is different when we arrive in extreme conditions, other than average, e.g. in hospitals, then we remove it using fluids or disinfectants. The second group is the microflora, which we acquire through contact with the environment, it is for us + foreign +, if it will multiply it can cause infections. And it is this microflora that, if we do not wash our hands before preparing a meal, can lead to food poisoning."
129,"SPA - a service of little communicative, but very good decor and atmosphere of the restaurant - Polish cuisine on a very good level - tasty and nicely served food; we were surprised by the offer of Indian cuisine in the form of a buffet in the castle in Mazury. . . . . .we didn't try it, because that's not the kind of place I look for. . . Clean rooms - but despite the fact that the hotel is only a few years old, it is beginning to see the use of some elements such as bathroom batteries. . . The service is nice, but as if not quite trained for a 4-star hotel..."
130,"First of all, the name of the building is discouraging. It refers to the tradition, but it is a bit offensive to the guests - because who wanted to sleep in the building for servants. Of course, on the page pictures of the main building in the palace style . Generally finished cheaply. The plaster is gone, contacts also not attached to the walls. Attention - air conditioning does not work despite the booking service. Even the windmill did not get us. I do not recommend for hot days . And certainly not for this price. Additionally - cheating with a restaurant . There are advertisements everywhere that the restaurant is open on Saturdays to the last guest. And here's a surprise - you can only buy a buffet package of 50 PLN per person. And no chance to eat cheaper, e.g. only soup."
131,"My old Grundig got served, so he was looking for 'em something in return. He bet 'em on a brand and an expensive product. It's easy to use, but there's one flaw in it that will never be a radio alarm clock. When the alarm clock starts up there's an annoying tap, the radio starts to play and its sound starts to rise to the max, the radio starts to roar all over the house, there's no way to set the level of silent monotonous playing. I like to wake up and take a nap and listen to the radio, but you can't get a frying pan in your head and you're going to turn that nasty thing off. One defect spoiled the whole product I do not recommend. Twenty-year-old Grundig up."
132,"The hotel is very good, but beware of the days when weddings are organized - that is, mainly Saturdays. The hotel organizes several weddings at once and the rooms are above the wedding halls. The hotel is not a high building (probably only two floors) and there is no possibility of sleeping on such days. Big difficulties in parking the bus - the staff does not care about the passage of access roads to the parking lot and the possibility of maneuvering a large vehicle. Apart from that, it is very good - boarding is ok, rooms are great. The building is quite new ."
133,"My objective assessment: continuous delays in the office, the best thing to do is to come half an hour after the time because on time you almost never go there, you can not count on the fact that your doctor will be there at 10 o'clock in the morning, most likely it will be 11 o'clock. 30 . Professionalism and experience of your doctor are unfortunately dominated by superficiality and laziness or (hopefully so) lack of time because contact with the patient is usually ok. 5 minutes . Usually she does not listen to the patient's remarks, she does not inform about the progress of treatment - she knows her own and knows what she is doing, but for those 160 PLN she could make at least some effort. You get the impression that you don't ""feel"" the treatment because what you don't get will be made up with the apparatus. And so they remain sawed, hypersensitive teeth, with some two slightly curved, bite like this. . . And to this change of price list during the duration of the contract! ! ! ! Unfortunately, the effect is not worth the money invested. Cabinet not for demanding patients ! In addition, requests for positive comments with the inclusion of websites, as for me - not acceptable. Of all the assistants are the best, who do their job and in addition translate the ""antics"" of Mrs. Dr . . . but the offices are great - it's a plus ; )"
134,"Hi. It was my first time at your house. Aland Juste and I will tell you honestly that she was m , pleased , she can answer any question you ask him , she had an ACCURATE EXPERIENCE , she was 6 weeks ago on a 3D ultrasound and assured me that the toddler is sizzling properly , I think I will go to him before the solution to the test to see if nothing has changed . All the more so as I'm taking drugs for horseshoeing and strong inflammation threatening premature birth."
135,"She didn't help my daughter, who had bronchitis twice a month, because she thought she was healthy (even though on the day of her visit she ended up in hospital in the evening with bronchitis and dyspnea). nor did she treat me like a parent, but as a shithead who made a baby for herself (I was born at 25, I look much younger). Actually, the visits were completely fruitless and wasted my time with her. She was careful that if she gave me the medicines she had to give, it is impossible for her to have dyspnea. ! ! !"
136,"It was a business trip, so I didn't manage to use all the hotel's attractions. My room was perfectly clean and I also had free Wi Fi. The service was excellent and the menu was rich and great. The hotel is located in the center of the city with an intense nightlife, and yet I managed to sleep through the night. The staff is very friendly and helpful in everything. I'll be back there in December and I'm looking forward to it. The only downside is that there is no room for cars, there is an expensive paid parking across the street. But even that won't stop me from coming back."
137,"Worst hotel we've ever been to. Good morning surprise. In the underground hotel parking lot, a cesspool has broken out and flooded the parking lot . The stench was terrible all over the hotel. I still remember. . . . The room was weak and poor. I realize it's three stars, but very weak. A strange smell everywhere, and also poor breakfasts on which there was not much to eat. . . I do not recommend! ! ! Never again! ! !"
138,"He bought 'em a train (a set of several straight tracks and turns) and a set of tracks, switches + crossroads. This set is completely useless. The tracks are not matching the track gauge of the locomotive. When you put the locomotive perfectly in the middle of the track, the wheels are on the edge. The whole wheels work on the left/right side of the track during travel, so that the train almost all the time one side of the wheels is in the air (outside the track). And worst of all, with crossings and switches. The crossroads are too narrow, the train is not able to pass it (once in 10, it happens to pass from the momentum). The crossroads are also barely overcoming the crossroads. The set is not really fun to play with if the train is not compatible with the tracks. . . At YT you can see what I have a problem with. Just enter the train spacing blocks in the search. This is my third attempt with Jixin/Blocks/Mubi. The first set ( 2 years ago ) of firefighters was ok , it still serves today . Then the builder's set - the builder's set was immediately spread out. . . And now this train. I definitely do not recommend these fake L . D . - . . .although the price obviously encourages. . ."
139,"The price is unfortunately inadequate for quality. She booked me initially a small utility room with a bathroom. As it turned out on the spot economy rooms do not have a bathroom but a shower behind a curtain and everything is wrapped in the fog of the People's Republic of Poland. Additionally, the room had an unpleasant smell. After these views, we moved to another room, of course, at an extra charge. The room had a bathroom and was relatively clean. Referring to the price we pay only for the location close to the sea, because when it comes to the accommodation conditions, in the accommodation units wriggled for 1 / 3 prices met with luxury compared to"
140,"We chose this property for no particular reason and we were not disappointed at all. The location was lovely and the apartment was impeccably clean. They organized a pick-up service from the airport, which was a good solution that they recommended to everyone. The apartment itself had nothing to complain about - it was clean, well equipped and safe. We were located right on the nearby square, where there were bars and restaurants. We recommend the Argentinean pub with beefsteaks, which is located nearby - just after leaving the apartment turn right and walk a little bit up the path. It was wonderful there and the prices were good. We also visited the concentration camps thanks to the organization of the office, which was worth it. We also went for a tour of the city in one of the golden cars that are standing on the local square - it was very good and informative. If we were to return to Poland, we would definitely recommend that the apartments were clean and the office staff organized airport pick-ups and tours, all of which were successful."
141,"Very spacious rooms, individual entry. The hotel is very large but the rooms are designed so that you can feel like in a cottage in the countryside : - ) The attractions in the evening and during the day extremely funny and nice . Service always smiling I am glad that there is a person working in a hotel who knows how to speak Polish. This is very helpful especially when so many Poles come to the hotel. The hotel is located on a hill which with all inclusiv option has its advantages, but it is good that there is a bus, although we have not located it."
142,General : teacher full of mouth ! ! ! ! He has a great attitude towards his work and students. Problems and issues presented very clearly. It's a pity that there are no more of them.
143,If you are looking to relax and unwind it is worth checking before your arrival whether the hotel restaurant has contracted any wedding. I did not check me and was an involuntary participant of such a wedding. Loud chopping of wedding melodies until dawn. Then a sharp cleaning after the wedding under the windows of the room. Building relationships with customers is not the strongest point of hotel staff .
144,"It was the second dermatologist who did not solve my problem. My skin comes off around my mouth, eyebrows, legs and others. The doctor suggested that I change all my cosmetics, that is shower gel, face gel, hair shampoo. Yes, he made 'em and got 'em three creams and some pills. The total cost of this treatment is about 520 PLN with the visit. . . During the treatment it was better, but the problem didn't go away. Of course I'll add that the doctor described to me very carefully what and when to use, which I was happy to do, because I didn't even ask 'em for it. Perhaps I should have come a second time to see the doctor, but he expected me to be 100% successful after such treatment."
145,"After an injury at work, my knee was in a lamentable condition, and several attempts to visit various specialists were really tiring. However, Szp Szp Szperzyński turned out to be a good orthopedist. He's a man who doesn't wrap himself in cotton. He immediately indicated the injury and recommended rehabilitation. Everything was established after one visit to the orthopaedic office in Poznan and I admit that I was positively surprised by the equipment of the clinic."
146,"I don't know what kind of material the walls are made of, but listening to what the neighbors are talking about even when the TV is on is an exaggeration. We greet Mrs. Mariola and the accompanying two gentlemen from the next room. . . Not a picky language, just congratulations. . . Luckily, even though the hotel staff tried to save the situation and after reporting you probably moved you to another room. . . In addition, as for this price staying in a room with damp walls - photo first wall at the desk, photo second wall at the headrest of the bed I do not want to think what was behind the furniture . . . . Plus service and breakfasts ."
147,"Mirabelle fruits can be found at every step of the way - in home gardens, along highways, in ditches and also in wastelands. They contain vitamins B, E, folic acid, sugars, mineral salts and very valuable bioactive phytochemicals. However, they are the most undervalued and unused fruit in Poland. Until now, mirabelle seed oil, due to its high content of toxic cyanogenic compounds, has been used only for cosmetic purposes. However, scientists from the Department of Chemistry, Technology and Food Biotechnology at the Gdansk University of Technology have found a way to eliminate the unfavourable compounds and use the oil in the food industry. ""They have developed a method to obtain from the nucleus of the seeds of this fruit food oil with a very pleasant taste and smell"" - informs the Gdansk University of Technology on its website."
148,"She was at the doctor's on Tuesday, today is Saturday and unfortunately I don't see any improvement; (the doctor seemed competent and as if he knew what he was saying but unfortunately he didn't help me and allegedly had help.

You have to stop it by waving your hand ... otherwise you can watch as it passes by without firing us, on the right a small town where you can buy souvenirs, there is a super market INKA - I sincerely recommend ... water 1 liter 0, 30 euros, and you can rent a car, I used the office MALAME and for 80 euros rented a car (without any additional cost, however, it is worth taking your passport) for 2 days plus petrol of course, for 500Km paid m 45 euros. However, be careful. There nobody is following the rules of the road, eyes around the head! They are passing by and on the right and left ! And what does a hungry Greek do? ? ?

The beach ... weak, pebble and rocky, it's better to have your shoes with you ... stones and mercilessly hot sand!

151,"At the moment, the limitations of the laboratory make the method used by only 2 patients per month. Currently, a modern laboratory is being created, which is supposed to significantly increase the number of preparations. It is planned to apply a new technological line in the process of production of TREG cell preparation, which is a modification of the previous creative process. Under the so-called ""fast path"", financed by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR), researchers and entrepreneurs will check how the changed production line functions in this type of research and whether it will be possible to speed up or improve the method of preparation production. The laboratory currently under construction, with the highest possible purity class according to GMP criteria, entails the implementation of new technical solutions and the need to prepare a perfectly qualified team. The research is subsidized by NCRD and the total project budget amounts to PLN 6.9 million and PLN 9.8 million."
152,"Since we don't like many low-calorie products, despite our sincere desire to persevere on a diet, we quickly become discouraged and as a result we don't want to eat them. Taste is the most important factor that determines our dietary choices. The team, in which Dr. Gładkowska-Balewicz works, wants to replace the fat contained in food products with gel, but in a form that will give the taste and characteristic fat texture. Such a gel ""fat"" would allow for real calorie savings. Its calorific value would be close to zero, while the real fat provides us with about 9 kcal per 1 gram of product. ""We want to make the processed products healthier and less caloric, but we also try to ensure that the taste, texture and appearance of the product does not suffer. For example, we want to make the fat-free yoghurt taste and look the same as that with normal fat,"" explains the researcher."
153,"I went to see your doctor. Unfortunately, I cannot give a positive opinion. Despite the fact that I have presented the doctor with studies which indicate a certain disease in which the maintenance of pregnancy requires additional treatment and drugs, the doctor ignored this disease and stated that the administration of drugs is unnecessary. After 3 weeks from the visit to another doctor it turned out that the pregnancy has died. I will add that it was the second such pregnancy of mine. Maybe if the pregnancy is going in the right way, the doctor is the right doctor to carry out such pregnancies. However, if there is something wrong, unfortunately you can see a lack of professional approach."
154,"Let's start with the fact that the hotel photos are out of date. I don't want to write a lot here but the hotel from the outside as from the outside will still get away but inside we were laughing in shock ceilings pasted with brown tape, dirty bathroom, at the pool it's already without comment, poorly heated food from last day, at the gym all the equipment broken looks like a museum. THE OVERALL RATING ON A SCALE OF UP TO 10 IS 1, DO NOT RECOMMEND! ! !"
155,"We went with friends + two four-year-olds. They rented us a 4 / 6-person apartment - clean, tidy, with a fireplace, 2 bedrooms, a quiet kitchenette. Only big minus for one bathroom with toilet. The apartment is big enough to put a separate toilet there or at least separate the bathroom from the toilet. An interesting idea with the names of the animals assigned to each house. Breakfast ok . The pool is much smaller than in the pictures. The internal playground for children does not knock down either - it is quite poor, mostly video games and slot machines for 2 zlotys. There is a ping-pong table (rather for adults) pool with balls. Tabakiera Restaurant - ok, on weekdays the service is efficient, on weekends the waiting time for starters / soups is about 40 minutes, besides the dishes look more modest. Restaurant Sniezka - breakfast for suites in the morning, pizzeria in the afternoon - a ton of yellow cheese: / Bistro pod Sniezka - frozen hamburgers, mulled wine ok ."
156,"Room on the 10th floor nice, spacious and with a wonderful view of the Spodek. Good food, morning breakfast buffet for everyone had something tasty and healthy. The reception desk was nice, although a little talked to each other - the ladies were pulling their social conversation, although the client stood and waited. Annoyingly, the ladies turned back three times from the 10th floor to the reception desk because of a non-working entrance card. In the end he got 'em two, one of which was also not working - a competent service man checked it. Attempts to pass the responsibility on to me - that ""you probably held the card by the cell phone"" weak because the card was held by 'em in a small pocket in the front of the jacket on the chest and the cell phone in the side pocket. Generally nice with some clutter."
157,"I'm just after your doctor's visit and I'm appalled by her behaviour and attitude towards the patient. Right at the beginning there was a problem with the referral, when she asked me what to do she said that she didn't know and that she wouldn't accept me, but after her assistant's imploring eyesight (very kind) she decided to do me this favor and examined me. Instead of helping me change my profession, she obviously didn't want to heal just to get rid of the problem and that's still mixing the man with the mud, she came out crying, no doctor had ever treated me like that before. I don't recommend it unless someone has strong nerves and likes it."
158,"I don't know. I came to Dr. Habas with the problem of allergy to contraceptive pills - the first visit to him, on the one hand I had a very good initial impression - nice, warm, conducted a professional interview. On the other hand, he did not even examine me gynecologically, he did not ask when I was examined, he gave a referral for mammography (here about the date of the last one he asked) and gave a prescription and already. She was my last patient that day and she felt a little ignored. I don't know what to think about it. I don't think I'm going to go back to him and that's what she promised me after the visit: ("
159,"The price of accommodation is not adequate to the standard of the hotel. The rooms are spacious, but the bathroom hasa, dirty, damaged in the washbasin. The crap is nice and helpful. Breakfast is very weak, not very virulent even the appearance did not encourage to taste. Water in the pool very cold, so you could not take advantage, especially children. Generally I do not recommend and I will not use the services of this hotel anymore."
160,"Maybe also a good specialist in orthodontics, but unfortunately quite expensive. Sometimes I had the impression that it is only the quantity that counts, not the quality when I went with my child first ""on the checkout"" until 13 years old. Unfortunately, she did not notice m definitely a clear improvement in the malocclusion of the child. Visit for a visit, still some remarks, still some tips, until I had to continue the treatment privately (from the age of 14). For every ""screw up"" the checkout, checkout and once again checkout, and so a normal visit. I do not recommend, I do not advise against it. Parents do what they can for their children, but such specialist doctors sometimes even have no conscience. Perhaps for them 30, 40, 50 zloty or more for a check-up visit is not much, but where does an average parent have to take such money from? And unfortunately, treatment often lasts for years."
161,"These analyses show - claims the Polish specialist - that despite the regulation and special design of such studies, the direct benefit and risk of participating in phase I studies in paediatric oncology remains at the same level as in studies involving adults. ""On average, ten out of every one hundred children participating in the study received an advantage (understood as the body's response to the drug, e.g. in the form of cancer tumour reduction). The study was carried out on the basis of the results of the Phase I study, including, in the case of solid tumors, on average only three in one hundred children included in the study, while in the case of leukaemia, almost thirty in one hundred children included in the study,"" emphasizes dr hab .

162,"Marcin Bruszewski, Member of the Management Board of Philips Polska and Director of Philips Health Systems in Poland and the Baltic States, expressed his conviction that the company's cooperation with the Silesian University of Technology will have an impact on the improvement of health care in the Silesian Province. ""This will be due to the combination of the power that follows the university (...), the know-how - how Philips and entrepreneurship in the region"" - he assessed, considering in this context as ""building"" the presence of many hospital representatives at Monday's meeting. Representatives of Philips Poland argue that the introduction of new solutions that will improve the treatment process from diagnosis, through hospitalizations to patient care is necessary, among others due to an ageing population, limited number of places in hospitals and limited number of specialists."
163,"As a doctor, it's okay, but he was too ""direct"" to me. he had stupid remarks, when he looked into the ear, he sat right in front of me with his legs apart, which I thought wasn't necessary, he could sit from the side of the sick ear, not very gentle, I felt not very comfortable."
164,"Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to seek advice from the doctor. She directed her choice with positive opinions, a scientific title and an excellent medical profile. . . The whole visit lasted 5 minutes. The doctor asked only one question at the beginning - what am I coming with, and in addition, she asked it by filling in some documents, facing me back. At this point the interview on her part ended. She tried to establish a conversation by herself, listing her next symptoms, her medical history, problems and questions that I have, unfortunately, all without response and interest. Finally, when I finished my monologue the doctor told me to prepare for my abdominal ultrasounds, which was done quite painfully, by pressing the ultrasound head firmly against my abdomen, I would add that the earlier ultrasounds that I had done were not so painful. She took the results with her, which the doctor only took a look at. Summing up the visit - she left my office with a more up-to-date ultrasound and the information that the doctor does not see anything, you have to do a gastroscopy. Interview - none, evaluation during ultrasounds or conclusions - none, interest in the patient - none, only referral for further examinations and that's it. From doctors of this ""rank"" she expected me something more. The only relief after this visit, that she did not pay 160 PLN for it thanks to additional medical care I have at work. I do not recommend"
165,"On 15. 09 . 2010 in the ""LIBURNIA"" HOTEL in Cieszyn about . 6 . 30 the customer consumed old, badly stored or spoiled butter . Concerned about the situation drew attention to this fact at the reception desk of the hotel and began a horror movie which had a finish in the sanatorium . The result was that instead of improving the service, the client was intimidated by the prosecutor's office and denied further stay in the hotel. The hotel showed a nasty approach to the client and the manager in the client's opinion should lose her job. I will personally add that thanks to this situation the client spent the night in a much cooler hotel (service and equipment) and much cheaper (also in Cieszyn). For which the manager and maybe also the owner of the hotel LIBURNIA thank you very much. I regret that I cannot advertise this cool hotel where the injured client spent the night, but the taxi drivers know him ... just ask. Greetings."
166,"I've had eye pains for a few years now, and I've been 'em on more than one consultation. They did some kind of full research and treated me for various things and nothing. Fear to think, but I've already started to get used to the fact that it hurts me and already. I got 'em to Mrs. Dr. Borkowska just to change my glasses because I couldn't see 'em very well. During the examination she immediately drew attention to my problem - it turned out that I had eyelid inflammation. So many specialists, so many tests earlier. . . it's a shame to talk. A real doctor - I sincerely recommend it."
167,"I was referred to the Doctor with a serious disease that is the City of Myasthenia and with its symptoms, which a few days later another Neurologist diagnosed faultlessly devoting a lot of time and attention so that today I function quite normally. During the visit, for descriptions like ""I can't close my mouth tilting my head back"" or ""I can't close one eye"" you heard 'em, you don't do that"" . The descriptions of problems with speaking, biting or swallowing did not impress the Doctor much. Generally, I got 'em another prescription for ""psychotropics"" and that's it. . . So, if you don't know what, you're treating your head. . . The Doctor receives private phone calls during her visit, it's a sign of commitment. . ."
168,"The Doctor is a great and versatile specialist. I went to her with a stomach ache and the Doctor diagnosed me with a thyroid tumor. She was right. Her great knowledge saved my life. Today I'm after my thyroid tumor surgery. If it wasn't for the Doctor, I would have wandered from doctor to doctor, who only ordered unnecessary antibiotics. The Doctor is calm, calm and very thorough. She's a real doctor's ideal for me. Since the beginning of my visit, she has inspired my trust. Although she is a gastrologist I think she has a great deal of knowledge not only in the field of gastrology but she looks much wider and her suggestions save lives. Thank you Doctor, I recommend her to all future patients."
169,"The survey - conducted by scientists from the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin - involved 718 patients, 84% of whom were smokers. As much as 60% of the respondents received information about bladder cancer and its correlation with smoking only from the doctor to whom they found themselves in connection with this disease. ""Most smokers make big eyes when we tell them that smoking is not just a matter of lungs or heart. After all, all toxins, which are the products of tobacco burning, must be expelled from the body. They, after initial metabolism in the liver, are excreted with urine, so the same carcinogens can have mutagenic effects on our tissues in different parts of the body,"" - told PAP Dr. Artur Lemiński from the Department of Urology and Urological Oncology of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin."
170,"What can I say, she's not always demanding, but it's a bit difficult for her, but nevertheless, for her, you know, she's just checking her ability and understanding, you don't know, you don't know, she's cool, even though it's a bit late for her, but I like her. Oh oh, reports are best delivered on time, and it's better to go to a consultation to explain what exactly to do and what's going on. : )"
171,"Mr. Bielecki operated on my mother's large intestine tumor on February 20, 2007, to top it all off, the surgery took place on her birthday. The operation ended with acute peritonitis. The doctor did nothing to help her and all he had to do was give her an antibiotic, he ""observed"". . . .he lightly handed down his sentence on her. After 5 days of ""observation"" she got a collapse and landed in intensive care. Her stay in the hospital was prolonged to 9 months with a lot of pain and suffering. Mom sued the hospital to the court, the case was won, in the opinion of the court experts (which I have to see) she was treated with the method used in the 50s, XX century. I wholeheartedly do not recommend this gentleman to anyone."
172,"According to Maciej Ludwikowski, most of the hearing problems observed in children are time disorders associated with infections, but some of them, if untreated, lead to more permanent hearing damage. In some cases, after some time, it may even turn out that an operation or a procedure is necessary. A large group of these are untreated inflammations of the ears, another group is hearing loss caused by noise. Noise in school exceeds 100 dB - results from research conducted for 8 years in Warsaw primary schools by IFiPS. An ordinary conversation conducted outside the room, with noise around the interlocutors, is about 50 - 60 dB. We can feel comfort in the car at approx. 70 dB . Above - the volume starts to bother us."
173,"I have the same opinion as my predecessor. I'll add that dinner like in a milk bar, certainly not worth the money. For 7 days, the carpet was not vacuumed. She found someone else's socks in the room. Location good, service at the reception desk too. The pictures on the hotel website do not reflect reality. This is not the place where I would like to go back to."
174,"I think everything is very positive. This is the 4th trip to Racławice . When ordering online, my requests were taken into account - great . The room is clean and large . The advantage - a large TV and tea and coffee set . Tasty breakfast . Also dishes served with the card at lunchtime were good; nice hotel staff (both at the reception and in the restaurant). I RECOMMEND ! ! !"
175,"A small, boutique hotel. Situated just outside Kazimierz . Rooms decorated each in a different style (I slept in music) modern and stylish. Bathrooms modern . Breakfast is good, but not delightful for recommended by Michelin - even the lack of good bread. The only downside is the noise that can come from the corridor."
176,"During the first visit, the Doctor conducted a very thorough interview of the symptoms occurring in our 1,5 year old son as well as a family history. The visit lasted almost an hour. The son was thoroughly examined. We were given a list of tests to be done with instructions where they can be done cheaper. So far the impression is good."
177,"Proteins, apart from their building function, also have a regulatory function, which means that they control all life processes. Their appropriate degradation is as important as synthesis. Not only damaged proteins are removed, but also those which are simply unnecessary after completing ""their task"". The process of removing proteins by means of the proteasome is extremely precise and its smallest disturbance can lead to cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. Many diseases are associated with malfunction of different protein pathways. ""In every cell we deal with both synthesis and removal of proteins. Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, while when it comes to their removal, we have two routes: one through lysosomes and the other through proteasomes, which I deal with"" - explains Karpowicz."
178,"The consultation was held in an unpleasant atmosphere, I strongly advise against this doctor. Lack of appropriate approach, empathy and experience, to this doctor did not penetrate the problem and superficially evaluated. She told me about her ailments, there is no energy to live in me, I have sleep problems and fears, I neglect basic duties at home, I go through stress and problems at work. She needed me to understand, advise, rest, and show me appropriate therapy. The doctor stated that my physical appearance does not indicate an illness and my needs were assessed by a sick note. She did not get my diagnosis or specific information and the doctor stated that she only came to me for my discharge and would not release me if I counted on it. I would add that after this unpleasant visit I went to another doctor, I am depressed and have anxiety disorders. Such advice is also for others, before you choose a doctor. . ."
179,"Nice, contact person . He listens to patients. He explains everything. If you need an examination or a consultation, he directs. There are queues to him because he does not throw the patient out after 3 minutes. The visit lasts at least 20 minutes and more. But it is worth waiting . The patient is not stressful, he can safely say what is wrong with him and what has worried him. It is very important especially for older people. Although she changed my place of residence and could change my doctor for years I have been using Dr Śliwiński's advice as a general practitioner. He will never refuse to accept a patient who is in need and has not managed to sign up, although as a result he sometimes extends his regular working hours. The GP does not have to be an alpha and omega. Instead, he or she must listen to the patient, and if he or she has doubts or something beyond his or her competence, he or she should refer the patient to an examination or to a specialist. This is the rule that the doctor applies."
180,"It has been known for years that our mountains are the most beautiful, but hardly anyone knows that the most beautiful hut is the Roztoka Valley. Girls give their guests a unique atmosphere, nice moments and most of all peace and wonderful food. I never miss this place and I highly recommend it. The absolute mountain hit number 1 ."
181,"I've been feeding my cat for about a year now and she's been sterilized. She used to feed her with ordinary foods such as : Kitekat, Whiskas and Purina. This company's food is very expensive for me, but fortunately you can mix it with the usual food and my kitty even loves it. The veterinarian recommended this food for health reasons, but I underestimated it because I have a friend who also has a kitten after surgery gives her the usual food for a few good years and nothing ails her, but unfortunately my kitten reacted differently and landed at the vet because she had serious problems with the urinary system. Since then I have been giving her only Royal for the kittens after sterilization. I really recommend."
182,"The hotel's service starts with the reception desk and ends with the maids, completely unprofessional. The exception is the restaurant service and animator - nice and smiling. The average age of a maid is 60 years and she can't keep up with the cleaning. We did not receive the room until 2 p.m., because from 12 p.m. there was cleaning. Unfortunately, what she saw when she entered the room too small was a shock to her: dirt, early guests' shit, the room was not moved at all. An argument with the reception didn't give anything, we were told to wait with the children another 40 minutes until they cleaned up, a nightmare. They explained that they have terrible traffic and lack of free rooms. Never again! ! ! In the all inclusive option were good only breakfasts, ice cream and unlimited drinks, very different but simple. The rest, i.e. lunches and dinners are all the time the same bad underdone food. Dinner was no different from dinner, no sausage anything for children to sandwiches for dinner. Only fries, fries, etc. Fruits were poor, coffee machines, or there was a lack of milk or coffee, and they were not replenished. @ years earlier I was with my family at the Wella Hotel also in Sunny Beach and I liked it very much, so this year they decided to repeat it. She chose to stay with her family at the Sun Palace Hotel, but we were disappointed. And most importantly, the door locks are faulty, if you report a repair, they will rob you. Friends from Poland broke into the room and robbed everything valuable, Poilcja did not even want to come. They said that the castle was faulty and they do not see signs of burglary. The hotel did not even show remorse. They said that the safes cost 20 euros and there you have to keep the money. Shock! ! ! !"
183,"Hello, I'm Mariusz, my visit was about spinal pains. The doctor after seeing the MR plate immediately stated that I must have surgery on the intervertebral discs, which are to be removed. The doctor was very firm, he quickly presented a diagnosis and effective treatment. He answers the patient's questions in detail and despite his young age he is a very good doctor."
184,"My one-year-old child had a rash on his neck, neck and in the folds of his hands, which later took the form of a rough skin lesion. The doctor said that these are skirmishes, which caused me great surprise, because as far as I know, skirmishes are not swedish. Of course, the diagnosis was missed, a simple soothing and regenerating cream did not help, because the rash continues to spread. Only the pediatrician helped by assigning ointment with antibiotic, thanks to which my child is healthy. The visit itself is pleasant, but its cost is total space."
185,"I went to see this doctor today. The doctor came to work at 18, 20 and he didn't have much time to talk to the pats because he was in a hurry because of his leave. Although I showed him the description of the gastroscopic examination which is not satisfactory because I have the H pyrola infection and a few more ailments and he has sold the subject that he has a holiday and has no time to treat the pats now only in 3 weeks to come as he rests where is the ethics of doctors and their oath to treat the sick for me this doctor is not a doctor only some - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"
186,"They planned to stay in this hotel because of the holiday trip to the Polish sea and the weather is different, so they were looking for a place where there will be a lot of attractions in about and so it was. When there was no weather in the hotel is a large swimming pool very cool and 4 saunas so there is no tightness. In addition, the hotel has a gym which you can use and next to the children's room so that the child can take care of himself, another plus a ping-pong table and bowling which the child also loved to play and the hotel in one evening organized a tournament of several families in bowling. Super fun. What else to do with the hotel are clean rooms with daily changed towels and linen changed on request. The food is good, a large selection of everything, in the morning at breakfast every day you fried fresh pancakes. There is a nice zoo, a sealarium, and a walking stick that surrounds the hotel, and there is also something to do. There is also an additional restaurant on the water where you can go and sit in peace and drink coffee. In addition, it is 10 km from Ustka and on days when the weather is good, we used to go to the beaches. Holidays are successful and the hotel recommends."
187,"I'm writing an opinion because she had a terrible experience of working with this hotel. She must have booked rooms for a large group of people, but at the last minute the lady at the reception desk, without even informing her boss, cancelled the reservation. Despite asking to contact her boss, she still did not get it. She was terribly unprofessional. The reason for this was when she said that she couldn't communicate with me and she encouraged me to cancel my reservation, and then she got an email from her that they cancelled my reservation for 40 people. Please consider working with this hotel if you want to have some serious business meeting because unfortunately it will not be on the right level."
188,"He spent 3 days in Aphrodite and I won't be there anymore. In my opinion, the hotel is depressing and unfavorable, by the road with construction sites nearby. We have been waiting for a room for eternity, because as the reception announced to us have only one maid and some conference. The rooms are ok, plus that they are spacious. The food in the restaurant is very poor - like from a poor school canteen. . . . .but less! Beautiful descriptions in the card and what if it's not correct and tasty. Spa area decent with the fact that it is open from 15 : 00 ? ! Previously a cold sauna. . . . I suggest you look for something else."
189,"I have a feeling for this place spent many nights in this hotel. The hotel is very well located in the city center. For this location the prices are good. Breakfast to party but that's not what it used to be. The rooms have the decor from the previous era, small bathrooms with small shower cabins. It is clean. Parking in the courtyard is not always space."
190,"As for the first visit there is really nothing to attach to, the doctor was very nice and competent - she asked about everything, examined what is necessary (breasts as well), did a cytology, asked whether to do an ultrasound, directed to additional examinations, dispelled my doubts about the method of contraception and explained what to do in case something happens. I recommend it sincerely."
191,"My old nose was my biggest complex and it was poisoning my life, while the new one was my biggest dream, which with the help of Dr. Zachary I was able to fulfill. It's been two months since my nose was fully corrected and frankly, I have no words to describe how happy I am. Dr. Zachara, a professional in every way, has a great deal of knowledge and experience and is an extremely nice, sensitive and empathic person. With angelic patience and serenity he answers all the questions, which helps a lot to reduce the stress and tension that accompanies the treatment. He is incredibly talented and talented - you can be completely calm about the effects. He helps his patients with a great passion and eye glitter. The effect is incredible! Just after 7 days (after removing the plaster), when she could see her nose for the first time in its full glory, she flooded me with tears of happiness. Already then the nose was perfect - symmetrical, straight and perfectly matched to the shape and size of my face. Since then, it has only been getting more and more beautiful every day. If I had to make a decision about the operation again - without hesitation I would decide on Dr. Zachara (the best possible choice!). I am delighted with both the effect and the whole process. The procedure is completely painless. I highly recommend the Doctor - impossible things are done right away and it is really worth to fight for yourself and start a better life - already without complexes! : )"
192,In August we were with friends in this guesthouse for the weekend. Despite the negative opinions that appear on the villa amor we highly recommend . You very nice and nice rooms neat and tidy. We really had no reservations and very good memories of staying in this place.
193,"This router is a failure because it is not able to work properly with the Huawei E180 modem, despite this, with the specification on the packaging, the manufacturer assures that it is poor to work together, which proved to be untrue. The router also disconnects the Internet after a while, and the firmware updates do not help at all. Perhaps with another modem this router would work, but the manufacturer should give you a real list of compatible modems on the packaging, which is only available on his website as you look for it. I also don't recommend that you buy if you don't have a 100% compatible modem, and for it to work, the manufacturer and model of the modem and the network from which the modem comes must match the exact list available only on the manufacturer's website."
194,"In two years' time we are planning further works - this time we will renovate three-room bathrooms. We also want to use the buildings directly adjacent to the hotel, which are our property - maybe we will arrange a spa there or come up with another proposal that could interest our guests and make the offer more attractive. Previously, there were rooms for medics who helped the pilgrims using the hotel."
195,"The hotel does not deserve 5 stars: very small elevators, narrow corridors, non-functional bathrooms - dark lighting (difficult conditions for make-up), lavatory seat set very close to the side wall, shower cabin without doors - to bathe and not spill water on the bathroom floor you have to stand on a drain grid, only one type of tea in the room and one sachet per person, very poorly equipped mini-bar in the room, b . small trash bins in the room, disastrous service in the restaurant, lack of some dishes from the restaurant card in the evening, poor breakfast, saving on air conditioning in the reception hall (stuffy). The hotel should have no more than 4 stars and cost no more than 400 PLN per day."
196,"I have used Mrs. Wiśnicka's services several times, but I was not entirely satisfied with their quality, at the moment I use a different office. Closing the capillaries with electrocoagulation left many scars. She gave up this method for me. Botox - actually, without any reservations, except for the price, for the same I pay much less now. Laser discoloration removal - without reservations . She said that at most we will close the vessels afterwards. But unfortunately, during the second laser procedure, which was a correction and was to remove the scars, Mrs. Dr. Dr. ""speeded up"" and damaged the healthy skin, which left a large scar. Fillers: once given perfectly, the next time after the correction remained cavities, holes. Apart from that, at present, much better anaesthetics are used than Emel's ointment (which in this office is probably the only anaesthetic used). Mrs. Wiśnicka persuaded me to mesotherapy. Unfortunately, there was no effect. During the next visit Mrs. Dr. Wiśnicka was surprised how it is possible that she offered me a mezo when this procedure in my case is pointless and only a standard filler can help. She spent me unnecessarily 700 PLN, 2 weeks she was swollen and all for nothing. She decided that it doesn't make sense to continue using the services of Mrs. Dr. because one fixes and another damages and it will last forever. And moreover, it will cost a lot because the services in this office are not cheap. The issue of approach to the patient one may suit others not, I feel more comfort in the office, which I use now. The office itself and small waiting room, usually crowded as in the clinic, lack of elegance and coziness. I have always felt like one of the petitioners, and in such places where I pay a lot of money for services I expect to be treated at a higher level. In my opinion, the quality of services is inadequate to their price. In Wroclaw there are better offices with a much higher standard of service for this money ."
197,"The hotel is well-kept, with cups and glasses of drinks and beverages collected in the garden and at the pool. The service will clean the room when we wish, and if someone leaves a friendly 10 euro tip for the cleaning ladies for the whole stay, they will leave an additional card to the room, which is also needed to turn on the air conditioning when we are in the room (after leaving, we take the card which causes the air conditioning to turn off, and so it can walk 24 hours, because we have such cards two). Wi - Fi free of charge in the room and on the hotel premises. Eating good food, breakfasts a little bit repetitive, but everyone will choose something, lunches and dinners every day different and there is something to choose from. A lot of the beds, as they are occupied by the pool, are under umbrellas on the lawn, so much so that you have never seen 'em not to be free. When you go on vacation to this hotel, you read 'em reviews and saw 'em write down like: that the planes are disturbed, that the street and cars are disturbed and so on. I answer: BZDURA . The planes actually see them landing but you can't hear them at all, the cars from the street also because it is too far into the hotel. Maybe if you sit in the swimming pool in front of the hotel, but there you can see them sunbathing and the elderly are rather lying down. You have to be really malcontent to get attached to this. Drinks are good but I'd rather buy a brand-name whisky in a shop 100m away (right of the hotel) for 25 euros for 0.5l. I also recommend the restaurant - bistro Hippocampus 500m (left from the hotel) very good food and freshly squeezed orange juice is sensational (price 3 . 90 euro but really worth a try) . And one important thing, if someone goes for a walk on the beach in the direction of Rhodes and wants to call Poland, make sure that he does not jump in Turkish coverage on the phone because it is very close, and Turkey is not in the union and you can pay 5zł per minute call! ! ! . Before calling, just check on the operator: the Greek have an extra GR e.g. vodafone GR"
198,"The doctor sent me for an ultrasound after a while. After the examination, he returned me to his office. The doctor, with a smile on his mouth without any results yet, said ""probably a waterman"" . Of course, it turned out that it is not a watermelon, no other cancer. But it stressed me out a lot. After seeing the results, he wrote me a referral to the hospital for tests. Only that he didn't tell me what was wrong with me, what he suspected or how to interpret the test results. He didn't answer any of my questions. The sum total spent to em a lot of money, for a while I almost had a heart attack and found out great nothing."
199,"The hotel visited me in May at a time when it was undergoing renovation. My vacation lasted a week and well, that's all. I used to have the opportunity to stay here, but a lot has changed since then. To the detriment of. . . . Unfortunately, there's BRUDNO in the hotel. And that's the biggest minus. Starting with the restaurant (some cutlery I was afraid to use), through the sand in the pool, to the dirty room (under the bed she found a bottle of old yoghurt). Building A is unfortunately being asked to be renovated, Building B is in the process. The restaurant does not provide such a rich menu as it used to be - on Friday you will find everything but hot fish. . . The reception desk is doing the same as the spa reception. Treatments are performed very professionally. Much to wish for is left to the pool and the approach of rescuers to guests. . . Such a disrespectful tone was not heard in any hotel. In conclusion it is BRUDNO and until the hotel goes through a renovation I do not recommend visiting it."
200,"The hotel is a very pleasant, friendly and helpful service. Sometimes it is hard to get along in English, but generally there were no major misunderstandings. The food is delicious, fresh and varied. Cozy rooms, with balcony and air conditioning included. Cleaned daily or every two days. Despite the traffic at the pool bar, the bartenders are full of kindness. The small cups in the bar are probably 100-150ml and because of that you have to go for drinks very often. Very close to the sea, a small beach, but you can find a place for yourself. Actually, it is not a problem to find free sun loungers provided that holidaymakers do not leave for the whole night or most of the day towels, clips or even stones on them to reserve a place. In general, the whole holiday at the Stefania Hotel is very positive and I strongly recommend it for a vacation, both active and for those who appreciate peace and quiet with the noise of the waves."
201,"I had the opportunity to be in summer and winter and in any case it was very good, maybe with some shortcomings. First of all, good cuisine, both the dishes served and the breakfast. The rooms vary in standard. In the old wing they would have to be renovated already, although everything is at a good level, while in the new one they are great. The only important point is the superior room. Due to the cold, we had cold in the bathroom plus the windows were leaking. The staff tried to help but there are some shortcomings you can't go through. The spa and the pool with a view are great, although they are not suitable for small children. The only possibility is a very small paddling pool, but this is not enough. The biggest winter attraction is Jaworzyna which is just below the hotel and the summer opportunity to go directly to the mountains. To Krynica 10 - 15 minutes by car, taxi or bus. We will come back but not to the superior room."
202,"In Poland there are currently 140 hotels operating under the brands of international chains. Although 4-5 star facilities are still predominant, economy hotels are increasing in popularity. Specialists estimate the current potential of the Polish economy hotel market at about 160 - 180 facilities. This means that if there were to be so many cheap but relatively comfortable hotels with 100 - 120 rooms each, they would have room occupancy at a level close to the national average. The appearance of such a large number of hotels does not mean that there would be a sudden increase in the number of guests in Poland, but that guests would move to these hotels from other hotels and other accommodation facilities. Therefore, the owners of new hotels would gain, above all, at the expense of facilities operating in other segments of the accommodation market."
203,"I'm very disappointed. The doctor recommended me to my friend, claiming that many people were cured because Mr. Nowak is a staff doctor. It convinced me because for me it meant that he was competent. According to him, the best antidote for everything are inserts, which cost 250 PLN (probably 2 PLN in wholesale), which attracts every patient. I also fell for it and I do not know if it did not make my condition worse. In the meantime there were some injuries - meniscus, goose foot inflammation (okay, here the doctor helped me, but it's actually nothing serious), finally a fracture of the second metatarsal bone. Recommendations - wearing a foot in a shoe with a stiff sole, frequent visits (I don't know what their purpose was), putting on tapes and a shock wave - of course I had to pay for everything and that's a lot (although the shock wave, as it turned out, had no justification for the fracture). In the office, the doctor keeps 5 minutes, when I ask questions, he dismisses me, he doesn't want to explain what's wrong, he talks on the phone, in a word, he's pissing off the patient. Maybe he has helped many people, I have a feeling that he has worn out the condition. I don't recommend it!"
204,"A significant number of managing directors, who are not owners but hired specialists, specialize in one area. Their technocratic approach, with the addition of network jamming, makes them focus on the department (or departments) they know best. This leads to such bizarre situations as not knowing the PMS used in the hotel. Even on a basic level. Or, ignoring this or that department, which directly affects the guest's service. Despite the fact that the manager - the owner ""knows everything"" - it is not sarcasm - he employs specialists who are supposed to work only according to his seemingly proven guidelines. This can lead to a lot of misunderstandings, on either side. It usually ends up with the specialist being blamed for the inefficiency of the owner's solutions."
205,"Who : prof . W . Mulak Course : Analytical Chemistry - lecture Evaluation : RECOMMENDED ! ! ! [ / b ] The professor is a very nice, cheerful and smiling person. The lecture is interesting, even if someone does not like chemistry. She has a great knowledge and great contact with students (but excellent memory, she knows everyone who has been to class at least once: ) ) . In the lecture he gives questions that may be included in the exam . I highly recommend: D"
206,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! ! ! The surgeon, despite the fact that he saw a picture of a tooth and the difficulty in removing it, decided to undertake this task, unfortunately, he only violated this tooth and then he found that there is no suitable equipment in the office in Sroda Śląska and asked me to come to him the next day to the office on Kolista Street. The next day I went to the office, he was still tired of pulling out a tooth for a very long time, unfortunately he still couldn't remove it and gave me a referral to the hospital. PS I do not wish anybody such suffering that I suffered from my nerves have been broken, and the tooth hurt me so much, that I was in pain! ! I want to cry at the very thought. From now on I have a grudge against all surgeons and I am even afraid to think that she would have to pull out a tooth."
207,"We went to Charlotte with our family and a small child in November 2016 to spend a nice weekend. After 1 night we gave up our stay. . . . . .why. . . . ? Here are some points: the hotel was cold, the restaurant was closed, cold and devoid of any atmosphere; music was played, one waiter had trouble serving 2 tables, albeit nice; poor food, and improvised food (schnitzel wreaths with potato salad) read pöl chops and potatoes with mustard? ! ? . . dessert old ( panacotta ) . evening buffet . . . . .you can see in the pictures, dried bread, uncooled wedges and cheese, very unappetizingly served, even insipid. Room (apartment) price 1314 zl for 2 nights. . . dirty carpet, biting smell (air freshener ... !??) leaking terrace door, stained towels, soft mattress in the bed (bedding clean), despite the canal +, 4 programs, the rest black and white, fridge - minibar - empty, papers from the predecessors behind the cupboard, cans in the corners. . . . . uff . . . . . . . .pool. . . . . . 1 impression approx. . . . .but the water in the pool is getting hot. . . . . ( bacteria ) yuck. . . . . ; the water in the pool is warm, but when the waterfall is turned on, it foam again. Maybe the hotel in summer is ok, but in autumn it is very sad."
208,"Let's start with the pros. Clean rooms at an average level, taking into account a room price of nearly 600 PLN per night. Location of the hotel near the lake about 3 km from the center of Augustow. At breakfast there is something for everyone. This is where the advantages of staying end. Choosing Weekend SPA package for two in the hotel "" Warszawa "" is a complete mistake. The staff does not know what is in the package, for every element included in the package you have to ask for. When asked where to go for a ""romantic dinner in candlelight with a glass of wine"", an employee of the hotel said that it is best for us to go to dinner between 1 and 5 p.m. because there is a Swedish buffet and we will choose something. At dinner you can forget about candles and wine. You can choose from 2 appetizers in the form of a salad, 2 soups and 2 main dishes. The most interesting was the next day. The wedding took place in the hotel "" Warszawa "". The restaurant was closed. The lady from the reception desk directed us for a romantic dinner to a drink bar. We managed to find the last free place. After 10 minutes of waiting for the staff to come, I went to the bar. The lady said that she has ""a lot of work to do"" and then she will come up. At the request of the staff, although she served coffee, we will wait calmly, she answered ""please go, wait now I will not serve. After 25 minutes from the conversation the lady still did not come to us. We went to the reception to report it. The lady at the reception desk answered that it was not her business because it was not her responsibility. We were forced to look for a restaurant in the centre of Augustow in order to have a meal although it was included in the offer. The attitude of the staff was completely detached from the reality and standards that such a facility should meet. The whole situation took place in a three-star hotel, not a roadside motel at the border. If someone goes to a hotel and wants to spend a romantic time he should avoid this place. In conclusion, I can add that even when issuing an invoice for the stay, the lady from the reception desk made a mistake and did not take into account the discounts included in the package offer. We were shocked by the extreme incompetence of our employees. I am not mentioning the fact that the sun loungers on the beach were dirty and had to be wiped before use and that it was also impossible to meet the decision-maker on the day of departure at the hotel."
209,"A large, partially renovated hotel focused mainly on the organization of congresses, congress cuisine, when I was a guest of the hotel, the hotel had full occupancy, so for meals served at the same time there were large queues, the congress facilities are rated at 4, well equipped rooms nice service, the hotel part where I slept in the unrenovated part with a lower standard than the renovated one, a very pleasant SPA zone on 5 with a large swimming pool and heated saunas, which is importantly open from 7 am. I estimate the whole thing at 3 mainly because of the room in the unrenovated part and the meal queue."
210,"Hello, I would like to share my opinion regarding the hotel Lenart in Wieliczka, the website says that the hotel is child-friendly, there is no coverage in reality, I was there for a wedding with a 7 week old baby from September 5th / 6th, 2014, I had an apartment booked there, I was going to Wieliczka from my town for 8 hours and we were waiting for a 10 hour journey to Germany, I asked the staff to put a special sterilization bag with feeding bottles for 3 minutes into the microwave, to my misfortune the landlady heard this, how she jumped on me, that this is not a house, that she absolutely does not agree with it and all I can imagine is that she should have a supply of bottles, I did not go with one bottle I had 10 of them and that such a tiny child eats little and often so clean is over, I do not know maybe she should have 50 of them or more according to you. The bottles were not sterilized in the toilet and as a result the baby got mould. I would advise against it, the owner is too big a lady of millionaires and the truth is that the hotel is built with EU subsidies. Please publish my opinion to protect other families with children."
211,"The hotel makes a pleasant impression, but only in the pictures. Poles get rooms in the basement with a view of "" nothing "". The building is 14m2 (it was supposed to be about 25m2 overlooking the sea/pool), but it's after a 6 hour fight, without a fight, room 10m2, in the building next door, with a bathroom behind the curtain, overlooking the dumpster. In the hotel, what you will not look at does not work: no jets in the jacuzzi, air conditioning does not work, the balcony does not close, the cot is dirty (vomit), the ladders in the pool fall off, musty and mushroom in the rooms. On the main building of the hotel there is a trace of the stars. Fell off? Did they take it? Anyway, it is right that they are missing! ! ! I definitely don't recommend it, I even warn you! ! ! ! !"
212,"In order to examine how air pollution directly affects human health, the researchers considered that prolonged inhalation of dusts and gases that collect near the ground contributes significantly to respiratory diseases (such as asthma, allergies, lung diseases, coughing, rhinitis, sore throat), the cardiovascular system (atherosclerosis, heart failure) and the nervous system (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). Therefore, a group of children not yet affected by chronic or civilization diseases were selected for the study. These children are between 8 and 12 years old and study in the Sosnowiec Primary School No. 45 located several hundred meters from the seat of the Faculty of Earth Sciences of the University of Silesia (where constant air quality monitoring is conducted). Apart from allergic tests, the children underwent, among other things, spirometric tests to check lung function; together with their parents, they also filled in monthly cards with detailed questions about the observed reactions."

214,"Hi. My opinion is that she's a very good psychologist, although she's been mad at her for many years because she's still treating my ex. She helped me great because there was a real breakthrough in my life and she believed in me, she believed in me that I was strong and valuable. She opened my eyes and then she said that she did not see in me and in my ex a common goal. However, because I was terribly behind my husband at the time, she still managed to reach me. Ex is an alcoholic and I understand that now he is her client and she focused on him . Believe me that ex is not an easy man and can show the face of a saint while he can turn into a monster . That is why for a long time she was m mad at you psychologist but decided to put herself in her situation. 9 she was angry with m when she visited her after parting with her ex and your psychologist said that she no longer remembers what was said (I am not surprised because she probably felt that she wanted m to be a witness on the case) ) . However, from the perspective she is a great psychologist and very, very thank you to her. I wish I could talk to her and tell her what I've achieved (some of my dreams). Thank you : )"
215,"Very cultured, factual and accurate during examinations and during pregnancy. The disadvantage may be its small size, however, all questions are answered exhaustively. The pregnancy service in its issue is also great for the partner to whom it explains everything: The doctor will also send you to a specialist in case of uncertainty and monitor the development of the situation.

216,"My first visit. I was properly diagnosed by Mr. Marcin after several years of running from a neurologist through an orthopaedist and finally a neurosurgeon . The pain in my buttocks and legs, associated with the fall of at least the first floor, was mentally killing me. From some medications to others, and as a result, the same result when I was put away. Of course my lumbar spine leaves a lot to be desired but I already know for sure that it is not he who gives such symptoms. Excellent diagnostician and certainly an excellent physiotherapist. Nice, warm in touch. I'm going to undergo his treatment with some faith that it will only get better now!"
217,"The website says that 3-year-old children sleep for free, but for my child - 3 years and 1 month - I have to pay as for a 4-year-old child. Why? Because it was born in December 2014 and according to the hotel is 4 years old. It is either misleading on the website or just rapacity. Very unpleasant ."
218,"Unfortunately negative review : 1 . Cold in the room , no possibility of regulating the temperature . Lack of response from the staff in spite of the reports . 2 . Very unpleasant service ! 3 . Weak breakfasts (bad coffee, scrambled eggs . . . ) 4 . Fitness room without air supply, stuffy and hot 5 . Receptionist with hands in pockets"
219,"According to the President of the FAStriga Foundation, Dr. Małgorzata Klecka, every third pregnant woman drinks alcohol. ""Of these 30%, approximately one third will give birth to children who will have some kind of developmental disorders, widely understood, including fetal alcohol syndrome. It can be estimated that in Poland approx. 900 children a year are born with full-blown FAS, and 10 times more - with various disorders which - one may think - are also related to alcohol drunk by their mother during pregnancy"" - she said . She added that children left on their own, without rehabilitation, much more often have secondary disorders - escapes from school, school interruptions, anti-social behaviour, breaking the law. ""Such troubles are much less, if the child is taken early diagnostic and therapeutic actions"" - she concluded."
220,"In June, the first guests will be welcomed by the 3 * Hotel Lamberton located on the Poznan Route in Oltarzew, 19 kilometres from the centre of Warsaw. The hotel has 55 double rooms, three conference rooms, which can accommodate up to 140 people after connection. The hotel has a restaurant, which is intended to become an open restaurant, thanks to its affordable prices, available not only to guests and travelers, but also to employees of local companies and local residents. The body of the hotel refers to simple forms from the 20s and 30s. It is ... only half of the building. In the next stage, the second wing will be created as a ""mirror image""."
221,"You know what I have just had a nice experience with the doctor and thanks to her our son is alive, and I know a lot of people who have the same opinion, and what a question is this, and of course I'm not going to give up visiting the doctor, and I may also accuse my gynecologist that he didn't notice that the child has a defect, but what will it do, also one of the better, or maybe it wasn't clear during the ultrasound, most importantly it's okay and the rest doesn't matter."
222,"ELECTRONIC MEASUREMENT II - EVALUATION Exercises : Run away as far as possible ! ! ! [ / b ] Because of this gentleman, I'm doing meter exercises again ! I don't know why they keep such people at this university at all ! ? The only thing the guy does at every exercise is that the tasks are completely unlike the ones he does at the exercise! He has absolutely no idea how to pass on the knowledge, bubbling from the cards probably gives him satisfaction, which he does not hide! I ask you a tragedy!"
223,"I do not recommend this hotel. Generally a very modern hotel. A lot of electronics - roller blinds lowered in the windows, lighting control panel in the room. So what about like micro rooms. The width of the room is the length of the bed. Very small bathroom. Sitting on the toilet with your knees you touch the door. A chair is missing in the room. There's no safe. Not even for one night. Eating for breakfast is a tragedy! I do not recommend this hotel."

225,"Waiting for a visit in the waiting room 50 min . As the doctor explained, due to the delay of previous patients who drove from a distance (allegedly she could not refuse them and had to accept them despite being late). During the visit another doctor entered the office several times without closing the door behind her. The waiting room had the opportunity to see and hear everything that was happening in the office. The diagnosis was incorrect: the tooth treated with root canal Dr. Dagmara recommended to remove it because on the basis of the pantomogram she found that the tooth is untreated and there is an inflammation and the fact that now it does not hurt is only a matter of time. She proposed one treatment scheme consisting of removing the upper four and this tooth after root canal treatment. When asked about other solutions, she said that the others are ineffective in my case. After consultation with another doctor it turned out that the tooth after root canal treatment is well cured and there is no inflammation (which was confirmed by a spot x-ray) and that this inflammation from the pantomogram is an artifact, shading, false x-ray image (as it turns out, the pantomogram cannot be used to determine the inflammation is not a suitable diagnostic tool for this purpose) . Not wanting to decide on such radical treatment, she found another orthodontist, who proposed treatment based on microimplants without removing a single tooth. I would like to add that I am aware of the pros and cons of such a treatment as well as radical treatment, but unfortunately I found out about it from another doctor. Yes, microimplants are more expensive and the treatment takes longer, but it cannot be said that they are not effective. The decision about the method of treatment should be a conscious decision of the patient and not of the doctor after the patient has been acquainted with the disadvantages of each model of treatment. Unfortunately, Mrs. Dagmara decided for the patient and after asking about other methods she did not inform about their advantages and disadvantages but only stating that other ( read . microimplants ) are ineffective and already . With so much competition on the dental market, she would advise me to have more respect for my clients."
226,"The hotel is a good place despite numerous shortcomings. Strong advantages prevailed. However, those who visit it must be aware that the initial impressions are not the best. The hotel looks like it was in communist Poland. The lobby and reception and also the pool bar is grotesque. It's dirty and a bit vulgar. On the other hand, the rooms in the hotel are clean and spacious. They provide a comfortable rest. Bed linen and towels are clean and frequently changed. The food is not extraordinary, but there is a certain choice and all is abundant. Delicious cakes. Furters, pizza and a few other things prepared for running. They're all equally good in options all. The beach and the sea are great. Beautiful sands and pretty warm water. I consider the stay to be very successful."
227,"She took advantage of her husband's Valentine's Day offer without looking at the opinions of this hotel before. We were in it 2 years ago and we were satisfied, so it seemed to us that the hotel is proven. Unfortunately, it was a mistake. The staff at the reception desk is rude, the food has deteriorated and the reality unfortunately did not correspond to the offer at all. We were promised a romantic dinner with atmospheric music, and we were lucky to have a Polish wedding without a bride and groom with interludes ""and now we're going for one"" with music so loud that we couldn't hear each other. The staff at the SPA did not inform us about a large surcharge for treatments, the reception did not inform us about the possibility of free extension of the day. The clientele has changed a lot in the last two years - at the moment it is a hotel for integration trips and trips of rich men with paid ladies. In addition, in correspondence concerning the complaint was informed about the criminal responsibility for ""spreading false information about the hotel "" . In a word - failure! And of course I advise against ,"
228,"Old, very neglected hotel, service often not in the mood not excluding the owner of the hotel. The breakfast is not very varied, repeating for a whole week two types of extraterrestrial, one type of yellow cheese and scrambled eggs from powdered eggs. Dinner very late 19 . 30 . For small children and tired skiers it is much too late. I will certainly visit Livignio, but never again will the hotel Europa ."

It recently broke down so she replaced it with his newer model Silk Epil 3 and unfortunately she was very disappointed with it. Even though he catches more hairs at once, he doesn't have the strength to pull them out, so he breaks them and pulls them. Epilation with it is much more painful than with the old model. I don't use a cap because it only scratches and irritates the skin. Generally I do not recommend it. Better to invest in something better."

After a long journey we slept in comfortable beds with wonderfully nice bedding and in the morning at an hour of our choice a delicious breakfast, i.e. a Swedish table with regional specialties and a large jug of coffee. To all this the house is located two steps from the Merry Cemetery. The only thing we regret is that we did not stay there any longer: )"

234,"On one of the blogs dedicated to Gdynia you can find such information about the facility: "" Hotel "" Central "" was built in 1928 at 1 Starowiejska Street, in the place of an old inn. ""It was advertised as a ""first-class house, rooms with hot water and central heating. Downstairs there was a restaurant and a wine bar, a large hall serving as a ballroom or a theatre and a garden with tables for guests, hidden under umbrellas or a wooden roof. The idyll was interrupted by the war of course, but after the war the owner regained the right to own the building. Not for long, however."
235,"Short stay , business . The building is well located, close to the Old Town, National Theatre, tram and underground. Unfortunately, this is the end of the story. Besides: total, dramatic masses, wholesale processing of guests, automatism, without any concern for the quality of service and comfort of the stay, with only the ""soft"" aspects, I do not refer to objective issues such as cramped rooms, lack of a hanger in the bathroom, sockets by the bed, etc . Restaurant service is disastrous and self-conscious / 13 . 11 . 2017 , evening / , long waiting time / room almost empty about . 20 / , burger completely cold, tasteless and served with great grace even without ketchup and additives, but with plenty of purple cabbage . Juice from fresh oranges only in the name, in practice only suspect ""improve"" with ice inside. Breakfast is artificial, average, scrambled eggs with powder, sausages and cold cuts from the bottom shelf, juices mixed with water. Generally quite quickly you take the attitude ""let's hope you survive until you leave"" . To sum up: very poorly, also as for Ibis. Unacceptable especially with a longer stay or with a child. I recommend training e.g. in Ibis Gdansk Old Town!"
236,"I was with this lady on her first visit to the gynaecologist. I am not experienced in these matters and she was very ashamed of me, unfortunately you did not make me feel more confident. Until one moment the visit was in a nice atmosphere, unfortunately, after informing you that some time earlier you had taken an emergency contraception, you said that it is an early pill and you should first make sure that I am not pregnant and then report to the examination. She had the impression that she had been tested only because she asked me to do so. She also asked me to have a blood test to choose a contraception, but my request was commented on in the words that the ""pill after intercourse"" sometimes doesn't work and it doesn't pay to do tests now that I may be pregnant. As you can guess, it didn't lift my spirits, although I was very shaken up by this fact and I think it was visible. The fact that there is not even a curtain that you can take off your clothes is not so important in view of everything. The examination using a sight glass was painful, taking material for cytology also, the examination using fingers was violent and also painful. She found out I had an erosion and after asking me no answer to what it means at all. She got m globules without information on how to use them. I am not happy with the visit and with the way I was treated, unfortunately I am not even able to come back after receiving the results of the cytology."

238,"In Italy, there are too many hotels, especially small ones, that bring losses. Mario Monti's government is going to carry out a thorough reform in the hospitality industry. The Italian press stresses that the statistics are inexorable for domestic tourism. While in 1995 Italy ranked first in Europe in terms of tourism revenue, it is now in third place, after France and Spain, and earns 11 billion euros less than these countries. Tourism accounts for 8.6% of GDP in Italy and 9.7% of total employment. One of the main reasons for this is that there is an excess of hotels, which are often uncompetitive, expensive and not attractive to tourists."
239,"Total ignorance of the patient, no history of clinical symptoms (from a dermatologist and then an internist with suspected Lyme disease). Opinion only on the basis of serological tests (ELISA positive, WB negative), which are commonly believed to be as reliable as a coin toss. When asked what the skin lesions caused by the bite of a Lyme borreliosis carrier look like, I heard 'em, that it makes no sense for me to be interested in it, the most important thing is that the doctor is sure that my lesions are not that. Another curiosity, according to the doctor: Lyme borreliosis is only carried by ticks. . . I definitely do not recommend it, it is a waste of time."
240,"I'm satisfied with the work and the treatment I've done. The only thing that annoys me very much every time, because it seems to me it is disrespectful, it is the constant answering of the phone by dr. Thomas, which makes the treatment very long. Unfortunately. Apart from that, I have nothing to reproach. Very good care and great teamwork, understand each other without words! I recommend it."
241,"Nice hotel located in a picturesque area. The courteous and helpful staff, spacious rooms, good equipment. The main restaurant offers a selection of dishes. There is surely something for everyone. The food was absolutely delicious. 5 * * * * * * for the chef! The restaurant was a bit knackered (old curtains) it is not a cheap hotel so I expected a little more at this price not paying for the stay. . . At check-in we noticed some cobwebs as well as in the restaurant. Overall a good experience."

243,"We spent a wonderful holiday in Mikolajki combined with the 30th anniversary of our wedding. For a few days we benefited from the wonderful hospitality and hotel offer. We had a great rest and we are delighted with the very nice service. I have especially nice memories of rest and relaxation in the SPA, and Ms Kasia and Ms Anna who took care of me. My husband often used the swimming pool and saunas and also very much praised these attractions. Excellent cuisine was a complement to a great holiday. The location of the hotel itself is very charming and impressive. Thanks for a nice time spent, you owe the whole hotel staff."
244,"The doctor normally directs the prostate to surgery without any examination and without ordering any examination. He accepts in the office in Dąbie, cancelling the appropriate fee and directing to the alleged examination in Trinitarska Street, where, after paying for the visit, he gives the patient a plate with ""advertisement"" of the treatments performed in his clinic and informing about a very affordable price of the treatment - a bagatelia 9. 500 PLN and free terms, for which he would be very happy to arrange the patient. He probably diagnosed the prosthesis on the basis of the color of eyes because the patient did not even examine it. Unfortunately, the problem was much more serious, not the prostate, but the bladder and kidneys. . . Congratulations to the doctor on his commitment, knowledge and competence. I advise against all such specialists."
245,"The doctor is very contentious and polite. During the visit he examined me and was very sure of his diagnosis. He prescribed a commercial of drugs and said that it would certainly help - unfortunately, neither the diagnosis nor the prescribed drugs had the intended effect. In addition, with acute knee pain, he did not even refer me to the service . . ."
246,"The proper name of this facility is a hostel, not a hotel ! No words about the room, let alone the bathroom. . . We spent there in July 2017 fortunately only one day. And they took the money for two, by mistake. . . . .or rather, by their skill. . . It's run by a Russian family. The parents only speak their mother tongue, so it's all on their son's head. There is no contact with the reception, the keys are left in the lobby. . For the first month of calling and asking for a refund, the answer was still the same that I wasn't the only one that had to wait and that they would definitely give it back. After a month, the answer they gave me was that after 30 days you can no longer return the money to your card and to give them your account details. After another month of asking for a transfer to the account, she simply gave up. To this day they have not returned any money and probably never will."

Work in this field is directed, among others, to early detection of neoplastic changes. It concerns mainly the digestive system.

However, the hotel makes a positive impression. SPA. . . . . .there's basically nothing to attach to. . . . . . .except for a spoiled large jacuzzi and a nonfunctioning single sauna (I sincerely recommend the steam one) . A clean pool with music heard underwater. Restaurant? . . . . . .linden. Bad food too fancy and expensive. Restaurant staff at 10:00 p.m. turns off the music and dims the light to make you understand - - - - fall. But the worst part is breakfast. I always compare scrambled eggs - - - this one was nasty and for a long time it wasn't at all like a few other products . . . . .when they were gone, they were not served anymore (nutella, horrible buns and, worst of all, tea cups). So the restaurant as if not from this hotel because the hotel and the spa different fairy tale and that's why only 3 wheels for the overall score."
249,"Together with our partner we always chose Novotel usually in Warsaw for the first time in Katowice and probably the last! We chose this network for many reasons but I was definitely disappointed. We flew in from far away, so she was happy about the option to eat 24 hours, unfortunately, there was nothing and nothing! We went to sleep hungry in a room that really begged for refreshment. For such money it is definitely not worth it!"
250,"A little disappointed: / We don't know the exact size of the baby or the birth temple because the equipment ""strangely"" shows. Moreover, recently I found out that I should have a pregnancy card, which the doctor has not issued to me until today (17tc), and after asking him, he was surprised that I do not have it because he thought that he has already issued it to me: / /."
251,"However, I expected a different standard from an Accor hotel. Apart from the proximity to Spodek and the low price it is difficult to find other advantages. Unfortunately, the most important aspects - cleanliness and service - have failed. The bathroom was simply dirty, and the service was a pleasure to work for. Well. There are other hotels in the area. . ."

I was going to be an allergologist for two years. . . . .the reason was a rhinitis, a constant cough and a rash. . . She was taking p / histamine drugs, which unfortunately stopped working as expected by me. First impression of the visit? - At last, I found myself in a doctor who asks questions and listens to answers! ! She did a lot of tests, which does not surprise me, because allergology is rather a field in which we rely on the results but also on what the patient says. The tests showed that I am allergic to apples and bananas, which surprised me terribly. She didn't think that a food allergy doesn't give the reaction that everyone talks about - abdominal pain, vomiting. She decided to stop eating apples and to my surprise because a few days the rhinitis stopped! There was a rash left, which I follow the advice of the Professor. I am writing down what she ate and what cosmetics she was using. . we will see if I can discover in this way what causes the rash = ) In general, I would recommend a visit to the Professor. Every doctor can prescribe antihistamines only that not everyone will ask us if e.g. we associate some vegetable or fruit from childhood that we did not like = )"
253,"Weekend stay . Lovely hotel, beautiful decor and atmosphere. Close to an interesting museum . Attractive spa area and pool . It was a stay for two, I do not recommend to families with children - at least not at this time - there is nothing to do with children (hotel located in a tiny town, no bowling alley in the hotel, no slides and zone for smaller children). The quality of food is average. No comparison with other Anders hotels. The food is good, but if you have a comparison, you can be disappointed. Examples - red cabbage salad with mayonnaise, dough as if from packages taken out ready, only water portioned in a jug for dinner, such a standard for a 3-star hotel I think. We are not choosy, but if someone really likes to taste good and varied food he can be disappointed. We generally recommend the hotel for its climate, beautiful interiors and interesting swimming pool."
254,"This hotel, the times of greatness are long gone. Stains on the carpet, scratched walls, damaged furniture, holes in the curtains, but the worst thing is that it's DIRECTLY dull! ! ! Nobody cleans up! ! In 5 days she has not seen any cleaner. It's not about the room where we lived, but about the hotel at all. Dirty floors, walls, carpets. The public toilets were once cleaned by the receptionist.) The staff was not nice, they didn't care! ! And for breakfast, an old, slippery cold meat. A nightmare! ! ! Balls for children are a real mess! ! ! ! ! Dirty, poured walls, trash between the balls. Additionally, torn safety nets, holey passages, trampoline with torn out springs. Really safety and hygiene were in last place. I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! ! ! ! ! ! She's never seen a hotel like this before."
255,"The first impression is very nice. The staff at the reception desk is very nice, but with the rest of the staff it seems like they would work by force. Not a nice approach to the customer and even aversion can be felt. The smell in the whole hotel is not as chemical as it would have just been pasted, irritating the nose. As for a four-star hotel we should expect a little more. The rooms are not completely clean, there is dust on the floor, the bathroom is not fully cleaned. The food served in chopped dishes is NOT SUBSTANCED TO 4 stars So not much is missing to pull up the deficiencies. - Coffee its taste unacceptable the very smell rejects (we are in Italy and expect a really good coffee - very chemical dough, cold meats with a bad taste - scrambled eggs and cheese very good really feel the class in it"
256,"Fear disorders in humans and animals can be treated with behavioural therapy. It consists in presenting a stimulus or stimuli causing fear in a safe situation. Repeated exposure to such stimuli is supposed to cause the person to stop being afraid with time. However, practice shows that suppression of fear is neither permanent nor complete. A sick person may stop reacting to a stimulus in a therapeutic office, but a change of environment, such as going out on the street, may lead to a recurrence of fear. As many as 70% to 80% of patients return to fear a few years after the end of therapy. Experiments of Polish scientists are described in the prestigious journal of the American Academy of Sciences PNAS. The research was financed by grants from the Foundation for Polish Science, the National Science Centre, the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission and the ERA-NET NEURON programme co-financed by the National Centre for Research and Development."
257,"For those who want to rest from, for the hustle and bustle. Silence, peace, cool beach and pool, super animation (in Italian). The staff is nice and helpful, that I would not speak English but I would like to. A few Poles in service (with Polish roots) Food great, lots of fish and seafood and seasonal fruit. Italian Breakfast - sweetened (but yoghurts and eggs are also found) Time rooms. The depots are open at certain times, but that didn't bother you. Attentive lifeguards. Nice gym. Generally, good rest. I recommend : ) )"

In the hotel everything suited us, the food in the restaurant was good, the rooms were spacious and clean, the swimming pool was also not overcrowded (she walked m after 8pm, 00), maybe only the ladies in the restaurant little smiling. And the most important thing to the beach close and the weather was also good. I recommend this hotel for a family outing even longer because there you can not get bored, even if the weather was rainy. Elza and her husband."
260,"Generally okay, hence the 4 stars, but I am not convinced that the diagnosis is entirely correct, because the cause of the pain has not been discovered. Maybe it just has a different background: ) The price is a bit too high for a 15-minute visit, the effects of which I am not quite sure."
261,"Due to the incompetence of the employees she lost PLN 109 because someone did not cancel the reservation. During her stay she booked two rooms, one of which was guaranteed by a card - this reservation was not canceled."
262,"A sanatorium, not a spa. The facility is divided into two parts, which is very visible . Standard rooms below any standard . Shower room with a curtain that does not cover the entire shower. The bathroom is all swimming. 70s standard. Germany's horrible loud and disrespectful of other guests. Service staff reluctant to help . I do not recommend and even advise against ."
263,"I got the impression that I came to 'em with a too trivial matter to the doctor (even though I have had back pain for about 1, 5 years and MR showed me the ""Ist frontal chute. . . "" ) . Too little information from the doctor about the causes, further functioning and recommendations. The only recommendation is rehabilitation. . . It was definitely not exhaustive information about the problem that came to em ."

265,"She went for a week's holiday with her husband in early May, the first impression despite the lack of free room ok (view, hotel from outside) . We quickly found out that it is not a fairy tale. It turned out that we can not stay for the whole stay but after 4 days they will have to move us to the hotel from the network because they have booked rooms. . we were angry and tired - at 11 o'clock in the hotel, the room was given to us at 15 o'clock and that's the information. . For moving in the middle of the trip, we were compensated so we were ok. The hotel itself leaves much to be desired. . Lots of stairs and falls. . . . .you can get pretty tired. Two of them were rooms - we had a swimming pool above us, which meant that on the terrace we had to get water cubes because there was a hole somewhere, how much it blew the windows almost fell out of the hinges - the husband was tightening the screws with a knife. . . . .power cuts etc . The staff wasn't interested in this kind of food - you could go crazy at the reception desk! The beach is small, minus that there is no hotel bar. I will certainly not return to this hotel. But I can wholeheartedly recommend their hotel from the chain - Athinia Palace there we were moved and that saved our trip: )"
266,"A place worthy of recommendation . To the beach just 2 minutes, all in place. Dinners are varied, breakfasts a little boring - still the same. When it comes to service, very nice and helpful people. The rooms are clean, although a bit ruined - depends on what you get. The only downside of the hotel is the paid WiFi, 10 euros a day seems to me to be an exaggerated price. If you're going to spend your time actively and not sit in hotels, I recommend this place. ! At the hotel 24h open shops, 50m to the bike / scooter / car rental."
267,"To start with, the location is ideal, the rooms are really high quality and the master breakfasts are excellent. As for the downsides, the staff, unfortunately, are either untrained or unwilling to work. A lot of confusion was caused by you at the reception and for example, my day was not extended even though there was room. In the morning it turned out that of course there is no room, and unfortunately we had to move out, I mark with a small child, and staying at least an hour longer in the room was also a problem for the staff. Another downside was that the room was untidy when we arrived."
268,"Hello. I'm very unhappy with the visit. Unfortunately, I can't write much about Mrs. E here. Sh . . . because we had one meeting. You're not very convincing, you don't talk much, and if you do, that's all I know. I would like to add that I am a person who is very much interested in psychology and also has experience with other therapists. I had a test for depression at the end of the conversation and the result was paradoxically stupid. Strong depression. In the test, the questions were so stupidly constructed and undeveloped - type; do you isolate yourself from people? She marked me yes, but there was no question of what kind? It is a pity, because you isolate yourself from stupid people. I appreciate intelligent and passionate people. Another question; have you lost the desire for sex? Well, nowadays it is because I am 5 years single and I think a walker on the street will not feel the surge of sexual energy to see some charming man. Hihi ! Stupid and undeveloped questions. It led me to the fact that you referred me to a psychiatrist for pharmacotherapy. And here I don't know whether to laugh or cry. In my opinion there is nothing worse than pharmacology. Please listen to the videos on YouTube of Dr. Coldwell's Eckhart Toll and many other natural medicine doctors and clergy. The pill, dear lady, puts the disease to sleep, not cure it! ! The second day after the visit she hired a private trainer at the gym, bought me beautiful clothes for these exercises and thanks to the training and endorphins I am the most modern in the world. Thanks to people like you, you can get down fast, but fortunately I have the nature that I quickly bounce back from the bottom of sadness when hearing such nonsense. Nothing thanks to this visit I will enjoy a very fit silhouette for the summer. I appeal to you! Depressions or pits also called depression can be cured; sport, diet, lifestyle changes, etc... All we need is a mentor who will put us back on our feet, but not a cure just for our own beliefs! And this is a great art. . flow of energy is also important. . Meditation helps for a while, although it is only temporary in order to cut yourself off from thoughts. Stress, depression is the main focus of thoughts. . If there are too many of them the volcano sometimes erupts. . She would like me to find a therapist with a broad spectrum of knowledge, a man who will surprise me and mobilize me, show me the wise way of life. Greetings to everyone very warmly and please defend yourself from pharmacology is a huge pharmaceutical business."
269,"This is just my second visit to Dr. Barczyk, but I am very pleased. Each time the visit lasts long enough, the doctor conducts a detailed interview, reviews the results of research in detail and performs the service in the price of the visit. She moved me from the previous endocrinologist due to the fact that she treated me for a year without any results, consultations (not quite frequent) lasted 10 minutes. My last visit to Dr. Barczyk lasted 40 minutes and the doctor answered all my questions and doubts. Visits in my case do not take place every 4-6 weeks (as before) but every 12 weeks in order to give the body time to react to the treatment (plus). The atmosphere during research and conversation is very relaxed and friendly. I have been commissioned a lot of tests (which is a plus for an accurate diagnosis) and the treatment has been implemented taking into account not only the results of the tests themselves but also my mood and the expected effects, because each organism rules for treatment differently and has different individual ""standards"" at which the patient feels good. The doctor explains everything very carefully, noting everything on the patient's card."
270,"Dr. Ewa Juchnicka is the greatest professional among doctors I have ever met. She is extremely thorough, competent and devotes a lot of time to each patient. She was the only doctor who stabilized my hormonal economy and today I can enjoy a 13-week, properly developing pregnancy, although many doctors predicted that I would have no chance of getting pregnant. Dr. Juchnicka describes the patient's state of health with great patience and sympathy, even though there are many patients waiting at the door, and the appointments are usually very slow and unfortunately you have to wait your turn. Dr. Juchnicka accepts in Enel Med wards, the visit costs 110 PLN (endocrinology or gynaecology) and 150 PLN (endocrinology and gynaecology) respectively. It is true that you should make an appointment well in advance, usually 2 - 3 months. But it is worth it because he is a great man and an unquestionable professional."
271,"The results of the research indicate many regularities related to changes in the seasons, although they can also be surprising. ""In the spring, despite the fact that everything wakes up to life, most suicides are recorded. But this time of year also promotes fertility, because with the lengthening of the day, sperm production increases. Summer brings more headaches and aggravation of symptoms of multiple sclerosis"" - explains the pharmacologist. In autumn, the first symptoms of so-called winter depression occur. It is also when girls have their first menstruation most often. In winter the number of diagnosed cervical and testicular cancers increases. Sudden infant deaths are more frequent . The risk of heart attacks and strokes increases, and in patients with bulimia - the frequency of overeating ."
272,"It was supposed to be my second visit to Dr. Paweowski in Artmed. The first one was an orthopaedic consultation and it went smoothly; it started on time, ultrasound was performed, the diagnosis was made and recommendations were given. The next visit was also arranged by the portal Known Physician and the aim of the procedure was to inject platelet-rich plasma. The visit was scheduled for Saturday for an hour. 10 . 00 . In the centre there was em at 09 . 45 , where 4 spiders were waiting . My turn was at 10 a.m. 10 . 30 , which was the first unpleasant surprise. I will only mention that the arrival of 45 minutes in the cooled waiting room at - 8 C outside is not comfortable. The second surprise was the fact that at the moment the patient who was in front of me tried to enter the office, a patient who appeared a long time after I came to the office. He claimed that he had an appointment. The doctor confined himself to stating that we are delayed. That was enough for me and he gave 'em up on the visit and treatment. The situation that happened to me should be characteristic of the state health service and not the private office. He assumed that due to the quite high cost of the procedure and the necessity to repeat it several times, I can count on a decent level of service. Fortunately, the patient can vote with his legs. What do I hereby do ."
273,"My friend and I spent a fantastic weekend at the hotel. The package includes four treatments. All of them were professionally performed and very pleasant. The wellness area is also very nice: three different saunas, a jacuzzi and a brine graduation tower. I recommend to extend your stay by one day to have time for everything. Fruit and wine to the room and a delicious dinner were included in the package. The hotel itself is beautifully located in the heart of the forest. The rooms are large and clean, equipped with bathrobes and slippers. A great place for a weekend out of town."
274,"I signed up for the Doctor some time ago. In retrospect, I think it was the best decision I've ever made. Anna is a person who puts 100% of herself into her work, she is a person full of positive energy that infects everyone around her. She is a very wise, empathic person. I think she is one of a kind and the best. The effects speak for themselves. With a perfectly balanced diet, where NEVER did I go hungry and delicious meal proposals we managed - 6kg in a month. : ) Each visit takes place in a baaardzoooo pleasant atmosphere ! The Doctor ALWAYS finds a solution to every problem and supports and motivates very much, which is necessary to persevere. I highly recommend and to anyone who starts I wish you perseverance! ! Greetings . : )"
275,"He was with his family in that hotel for a week. If I'm to sum it up in one word: weakness. The arguments on the plus side : - location - to the lake near, the hotel is located on the sidelines so also far from civilization . - Food (lunches only) Arguments to the minus: - attractions in the hotel - on the website you can read that there is a bowling alley, wellness and spa area, gym, bajkolandia. I will describe them briefly. Bowling alley: you can write about it that there is a bowling alley. And that's it. Out of 3 tracks one is completely out of use, 2 others are in an almost agonal state. Bowling is constantly falling down, the track is curved . Wellness and spa area: this includes: a swimming pool, namely 2 pools (a small one for children about 50cm deep and a bigger one about 170cm deep.) There is also a jacuzzi and 2 saunas. In the small pool, the water is cloudy, massacrically chlorinated, but relatively warm. In a large pool, the water is cooler and a little less chlorinated. The Jacuzzi either did not work (no possibility of manual control of the nozzles from the panel on the bathtub), or was polluted with something. The saunas even worked, although I don't know if there was such a temperament in them as was displayed on the controllers. To this I must add that the ceiling was falling off at times and it was a little dark. Gym - in the room there were: stepper (damaged in my opinion), atlas - life-threatening - broken rope rolls, wipes on the backrests and rods. Orbiter - not working . 3 bicycles, one of which is relatively efficient. The defects were reported to me already on the day of arrival - it was drenched . The solarium and whirlpool were unfortunately not checked by me, but probably their condition is similar. Bajkolandia - short - SYF . The equipment to play destroyed, the trampoline destroyed and threatening safety, balls everywhere and not in the pool, sometimes exposed tubes (should be protected with a sponge). Reported defects - defects cast! . There are also a few vending machines, but additionally paid for, so they are working. Rooms: we had the misfortune to spend the night / visit in 3 rooms: 159, 157 and 124 . Because some of the rooms are designed for colonial groups so: handles in the door fall out, windows do not close, mushroom on the walls (159) . In 157 conditions a little better, but there is no ideal. In 124, after the rain comes out a mushroom on the walls and ceiling, night lights badly screwed on, threatening life and health. The air conditioning is but not cool. WiFi is but with me on 3 phones the connection was broken. Food - lunches ok - every day a little different menu, tasty. Breakfast every day the same (scrambled eggs with flour, sausage, croutons, sausages (unfortunately the cheapest)). The problem is that the service did not keep up with the change of service, so there were no plates, cups, hot water for coffee, often and the next portions of food. The rooms were not ready at 4 p.m. - the service is not done. Another problem - colonies - noise, mess, mess. Beach - close, but neglected, little sandy, additional attractions paid for (canoes, water bikes). To sum up . If you want to rest it is not there (colonies). A beautiful place, but not used. Maybe the situation will change if there is an accident (because the equipment is very damaged). I do not recommend!"
276,"He used 'em once, because he used 'em for a long time after the second and third time, so that the appetizer would rotate at all. He cleaned 'em, replaced 'em with another, poured less milk into 'em. He just doesn't want to take off. It probably works on the principle of an electromagnet, but after flooding with milk it doesn't have the strength to turn, or it's not well-balanced. It's a pity, because the milk was very well foamed. In combination with the capsule machine and the coffee itself, it makes coffee like from an automatic pressure machine for 3000 - 4000 PLN. I'm sorry, I must advise against it. I send back my product."
277,"my two stars are based on my visit last week. My visit lasted exactly 6 minutes. The doctor at first asked me why I came, looked into my eyes, drew something on a piece of paper - (not a word!) and then prescribed 3 drugs and told me what they are and how to take them. I was even surprised, because one of the medicines was a ""disease"" I had no idea about and I asked - I have it. . . and Dr. Bishop. responsible - 'yes. ""and nothing more. However, I wanted to find out a little bit more and I say with time the doctors ask if I have joint problems and my joints never hurt. . . .and he says to me 'yeah, then it's not gonna happen now. . . . I hope the medication works, but that's not how I imagined the visit would work - especially to someone called a homeopath: /"
278,"Unfortunately, after a weekend stay in Primavera, I don't have the best rating about this facility. There are no bathrobes in the rooms, the day ""hotel"" ends at one hour. 10 : 00 . Such food for myself . I do not recommend"
279,"English in science and technology I absolutely recommend very interesting and stress-free classes. Mr. Mariusz probably knows everything about everything, in each class you will find out what and which is just the anniversary :) Two colloquia plus unannounced cards (there were two of them) consisting of translating a few words into English. Attention! Catch on downloading is 2.0 from the job. Moreover, an obligatory paper 15 minutes on a chosen topic. Final evaluations: between 4 and 5 . One girl failed the paper and downloaded it on one wheel (caught and asked to leave the room) and got 3 or 5."
280,"I have a different opinion, the doctor ignores what he is told, he is hiding behind the savings, he does not send what is needed for this examination, and if somebody is right, he laughs with sarcasm, if it wasn't for another doctor, my husband would have been underground a long time ago, and it's not true that he sends to the specialists, he just saves on pats, and after all the taxes we all pay I do not recommend this doctor."
281,"Ultrasound done. Fine interview done. Generally artificially smiling and pretending to be friendly for a few minutes visit . She doesn't like it when the patient asks questions, disagrees with her views and recommendations. Very NOT discretely ""excuse"" the confused patient by printing a receipt. She was once and never again."
282,"Very nice stay in an intimate hotel, nice interiors with tasteful decoration without splendour. Employees at a high level take care of their guests. Ladies working at the reception desk can efficiently solve the problems (mistake in the reservation - delux room instead of apartment). Location in a quiet area away from the hustle and bustle of the city, near the spa park, a nice view from the window. A great place as a base for exploring the Kłodzko Valley. Rooms are spacious, modestly but stylishly furnished. Cleanliness on an impeccable level. Despite the prevailing winter outside the window, the hotel is warm. The pool is clean, the water is warm, bright and spacious thanks to the glass pane. In the morning hours it was completely empty - we felt like we were in a private residence. The Wellness and SPA area is well equipped. Intimacy, romantic atmosphere, comfort during treatments and the full professionalism of the staff are conducive to a relaxing holiday for two. Wide range of treatments is one of the biggest advantages of the hotel. Food in the form of a Swedish table, a large selection of dishes especially for lunch and dinner. Simple, but tasty. We will gladly use it again! The disadvantage is the gym - some of the exercise equipment is not working, and the high temperature is not conducive to physical exercise - too hot."
283,"I applied to P . Igor with ankle pain. I suffered an injury to 'em much earlier, also it was an older case in addition untreated earlier. The pain was growing and preventing normal functioning. During the medical interview, he gave 'em all the circumstances that accompanied the alleged injury. P . Igor stated that nothing serious ails me but overloaded em . One should watch out for the ankle and not overload it to allow it to regenerate, change the nature of work and life (give up sporting activities) . When asked whether all this or not requires additional ultrasound, X-rays, even laboratory tests, medicines, he stated that he sees no need, there is no point in spending unnecessary money. The pain did not go away, so he decided to go to another doctor, where at the first visit was made an initial diagnosis - myositis / fibula ligamentitis. The doctor without hesitation referred me for ultrasound and laboratory tests. The tests confirmed the diagnosis of the doctor, and also the fluid formed in the sinewy tube. The only thing I'm grateful for is the P . Igor for giving me 2 weeks of sick leave, which enabled me to regenerate, because the first doctor from the National Health Fund was not even kind enough to take an interest in my case, but she only underestimated it (she thought she was simulating? sic!) . He chose em P . Igor because he claims to be a specialist in the category of sports injuries, on my example you can see that he has no idea, because when comparing the course of the ankle examination by P . Igor and the last doctor is like heaven and earth. The last doctor checked very carefully cm by cm the area around the ankle and finally found the place of pain, P . Igor unfortunately did it in the dark. He paid twice as much for the specialist in Poznań, but it was worth it. And the money spent on a visit to P . Igor's money was thrown into the mud - very poorly indeed."
284,"Despite the sincere willingness of the doctor during the treatment of my daughter, unfortunately she could not find the cause of the deterioration of her health. The visits went on calmly and thoroughly, the interview was carried out in detail, unfortunately but the colossal amounts that were spent on drugs as well as on the visit without even knowing the reason do not encourage to come again, at least I know what can be excluded in the course of the next treatment. I recommend the doctor because you can see that he is with vocation, but unfortunately I am not satisfied."
285,"For several years now, work has been ongoing on ketamine, a hallucinogenic agent also used as an animal anaesthetic. It turned out that in the case of people suffering from depression, an appropriate dose of ketamine interrupts a bad mood attack during the day. ""This may be a breakthrough in the treatment of depression,"" says prof. Vetulani . He reminded that the research on this treatment is conducted in Poznań by professors Janusz and Filip Robakowski . The neurobiologist also reminded about the research on drugs prolonging youth and life . Apart from metformin, he pointed to the results of work on nicotine mononucleotide (NMN), which stimulates the so-called. longevity gene. Introduced into the diet of laboratory mice, it has prolonged their life by 40% . However, even without the application of such therapy, people today live longer and healthier lives - indicates the scientist ."
286,"I was at that doctor's with my sick daughter. She has 2. 5 and literally water was pouring out of her, I also had a problem with the intestine, and the doctor wrote me some medicine for her to drink and some sachets with a cover. I wanted me to go to the hospital as if dehydrated, but she tells me that she would drink my orsalite and it would be fine, she would give me every moment, she drank 5 glasses and it was fine tomorrow, she got better. In 3 days she would run and have fun. I recommend her, I'm quite happy."
287,"Weak meals, soups at cold dinners, lack of service at meals, you had to wait for plates and cups - which were not cooked. Meals were poorly varied. A room without heating with a small, poorly functioning, supplied heater - the hotel is not suitable for the trip in the autumn and winter months. The hotel has a supposed spa, which is served by one lady masseuse from an hour. 13 to 21 in a cold office. Departure with friends, which was to be a pleasure turned (thanks to the arrogance of the owner) into a nightmare. The hotel does not meet the standards for which it charges high fees. I do not recommend ."
288,"I have a sick stomach. After the first gastroscopy at the hospital in Lubin (in 2003), the doctor said that everything cannot be removed. After visiting Dr. Solomon, after another gastroscopy, the doctor said that he had worked 'em on it for 25 years and the treatment would be long lasting. The stomach worked poorly and weighed only 65 kg. Currently I'm still on medication, nothing had to be removed, I weigh 84 kg (lightly overweight), I enjoy life. After these few years of contact with Dr. Solomon I can recommend him with a clear conscience. It is important to hear and understand what the doctor says and recommends and not to hear what you would like to hear. I wish you all a lot of health and as little use as possible of the doctors."
289,"They decided to spend the long June weekend in this hotel. We bought the offer on one of the portals offering group shopping. The hotel from outside looks good. However, access to the lake is terrible. There is no designated place to bathe and the beach as for a four-star hotel. The rooms have no deck chairs or chairs on the balconies. For such a large hotel, of course, there were two kayaks and two water bikes available for a fee. The rooms are quite clean but there is no suitable bedding for these standards. In the bathrooms only liquid soap in a collective container. We found ourselves in a bathroom with a bathtub that was lacking in traffic jam. Every request to the staff related to reporting a defect was left without an echo. The food was a great disappointment. Practically no choice, always one species of meat and fish. We felt like we were in the People's Republic of Poland because there were long queues and something was always missing. The price was not adequate to the hotel standard. Max for this hotel is three stars."
290,"An excellent professional to whom I owe a lot. For a few years I have been suffering from a number of doctors, which has made the condition worse and none of them helped me at all. If I had been with Rokicki right away, I am sure he would have been 100% healthy. He helped me a lot. I feel much better. I've operated on 'em twice and there are effects. Greetings, Doctor. And that in some opinions it's written that there's no time for patients, that's bullshit. It's people who have no time for this doctor. And you have to have a lot of time for him. And it's worth finding that time."
291,"The hotel is terrible, or rather should em write the resort, because there are some turmoil around whether it legally uses the term ""hotel"". There are no stars, you can see that they were sealed above the entrance, maybe it was in the 70s. The rooms have a mushroom, a bowling alley so that two tracks do not work, one barely zips, the food is nasty. It is not any Olsztyn at all, but some Gutkowo. Holes in walls and doors also happen. The whole thing is covered by two Ukrainian cleaners, so you can imagine cleanliness."
292,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, when buying a router for 800 PLN you would expect professional equipment, unfortunately nothing like that. QoS function based only on priorities and not the allocation of a specific bandwidth in my opinion a little bit misguided, moreover, the list of about 15 devices that I managed to work out so that the network works optimally after about 2 months when rebooting the device from the Android application - flew away irretrievably and all the devices got a normal priority. Now I have learned by experience I have a . txt file in which I keep the MAC and device names and priorities so that if necessary I can quickly restore the settings. WiFi works the same way as in routers for about 300 PLN, I did not notice me improving the menu from the browser level very unintuitive, much more convenient, but maybe it's a matter of habit I was working on cheaper routers from the middle shelf Definitely would not buy me again this equipment"
293,"Since most of the rooms in the hotels were booked a year before the event, the hotel owners decided - probably rightly so - to seize the opportunity and significantly increase room prices - in some cases, taking into account the standard and quality of service, probably rather wrongly. They protested and threatened to boycott, among others, developing countries from the G77 Group, claiming that the hotels in Poznan screw prices and for ""one"" they want 300 euros each. Hotels also demanded 100 percent prepayments several months in advance. Even the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection took care of the matter."
294,"Soul man ! I had the pleasure to meet Mrs. Beatke at the MAMMA birthing school, she learnt a lot of m and she learned a lot about the first child and the second one. Mrs. Beatka always helps when I have any questions, she could always count on her at any time, thanks to her I felt safe and calm in pregnancy and after the birth. There are few people with a big heart like Mrs. Beatka! ! ! Thank you once again and we greet you warmly! Iwona, Nathaniel and Nadia.)"
295,"Good location, useful elevator, quiet windows, towels on the equipment. The negatives are a dirty sticky fabric couch, a problem with the lack of toilet paper and throwing away waste. Breakfast and lunch are quite tasty (there were too salty and feathered dishes). Lunches served, lack of choice of lunch options, long waiting time for lunch about 0 , 5 h . Although the restaurant was empty, lunch portions were very small, no water for lunch (it should seem to be standard). The scandal is the fact that the soup was served in a tiny bowl - cup (in the variant of purchased lunches), and when we ordered the soup from the menu it was served on normal plates. Savings on dishes and water shows disrespect for the customer, and the owner should be able to rely on the good opinion, because he has several hotels in Szczawnica and at the back of the apartments, the park is currently building another hotel (problem with parking spaces, construction nuisance)."
296,"Hotel with a lower standard than 4 * . Air conditioning with low power in the room. Very small rooms, food is the worst side of the hotel. Dirty cups and plates. Poor quality products. Hotel focused on customers from Germany. Poor animation . The best dishes of the card are not included in all inclusive. The hotel deserves 3 * max"
297,"After all the opinions that she had read and heard m - that she was not nice, not sensitive, etc . - She was afraid to visit me. However, the doctor impressed me as a professional and very concrete person. Maybe because I know that my dizeck is not right and I do not expect someone to stroke my head and say - I will do a miracle. I got a referral for further research, the doctor was overwhelmed by our results and even smiled. My daughter did not feel uncomfortable during the examination (surprisingly!). I also give her a positive opinion. And when it comes to the next examination we will see . I will improve the opinion the most ; )"
298,"Recently opened hotel practically right opposite the railway station in Wroclaw. Perfectly arranged rooms where we are surprised by details related to the history of Ania from Zielona Wzgórze (big applause for the idea). In addition, the room surprises us with a large window being one of the walls. Breakfast without madness, just a strong hotel standard. But using the congress center surprised em with a very good level of service and quality of meals served during breaks. I will certainly come back during my next stay in Wroclaw."
299,"""The difficulty of these procedures is that three vessels are leaving the convex aortic arch: the brachio-head trunk, the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery"" - explained PAP prof . Nazarewski . Therefore, in a patient operated on on Wednesday, just like in previous patients, it was necessary to order this type of intravascular prosthesis ""for the size"" of his aorta, because in each person the aortic arch with vessel branches is slightly different. The greatest difficulty was the precise positioning of the stent - graphite so that the sleeves would be placed exactly in the place of the respective arteries' outlet. The denture must be placed in such a way that the sleeves protruding from the denture are placed exactly in the place where the vessels are leaving. Insufficient fitting could cause acute ischaemia and myocardial infarction or ischaemia and massive stroke."
300,"We were expecting a romantic stay and in the meantime we met with great disappointment. It started with a parking lot from which the passage looked almost like a survival school. After the rain, it was impossible to go through without the galleys. A hole in the hole - drama . On the spot it turned out that there is another parking lot behind the hotel which is in good condition but is paid 40 PLN per night! The elite of the castle with the boss at the head park probably in the back and probably are not aware of what the public parking lot that is the showcase of the castle looks like. After a nice impression during the check-in and a cozy room, further in the restaurant we met another disappointment. The restaurant seems to live its own life and the employees do not know what they are doing there. Some of the staff asked us to use the buffet in the evening, but none of the waitresses knew how much it cost! ! ! We were informed at the reception desk. The surrounding area is a perfect place for long forest walks and horseback rides. In the morning, the bad impression of the retreat was compensated by a delicious breakfast. A place with a lot of potential, but noahs to the end used up."
301,"She booked a room from TRAVELIST option for an extended weekend in January . According to the offer we had a wellness area, breakfast and dinner buffet. I will start with the decor: The first thing that encouraged me to book a stay in this facility is the design! ! If I could, I would not leave our room, which was huge and beautiful! We had a room on the ground floor from the reception: ) Spa offer : I don't understand complaining about the pool ? ? After all, everything is in the description, you can also call and find out what size it is, I don't think that the pool is the downside of the hotel, they have it and you have to come to terms with it :) I was happy with it, at the time when we were here, there was no huge occupancy. Everything was clean, we even got the sauna oils for aromatherapy: ) Food: Delicious! ! ! Breakfast is very rich, a lot of sweetness, fruit and dry additives. Dinners also very big choice, every day two soups, several kinds of meat, fish, salads - there was no need to complain about a person like me who does not eat meat and fatty food: ) Operation : Very good for you : ) all helpful, kindly. Without reservations : ) I also recommend the hotel with all my heart! ! We rested like never before: )"
302,"Unfortunately, I've given the restaurant a few times and unfortunately always the same. Food not tasty without a taste carry is unfortunately an ordinary stew with an added spice terrible. No wonder that the restaurant shines empty. I often stay there for trainings but I will not go to the restaurant anymore."

THIS IS AN EXAMINATION ! ! ! ...dark maso and not a photographer's picture - and why didn't she make the kid pose? ? ? maybe it's his fault that he doesn't have a souvenir because he turned out wrong - I suggest to take out a sanction against the child after the birth. . . .

305,"At the Hotel La Palma Princess we spent a week with our family at the end of September. The hotel itself is huge and provides many attractions during the day as well as in the evening. The island is very nice, so I recommend that you buy trekking tours (I was on the ones led by a Polish guide, Lucjanapiere a true enthusiast of nature and life). The food at the hotel is tasty and varied."
306,"There were several surprises. First of all the lobby, which did not resemble the appearance of others in this hotel chain. Small, gray, squalid. Second, the neighborhood or actually an incident that took place in the corridor in the middle of the night. Screams, cries for help, the sounds of a fight. In a word: horror. The advantage was quite big and clean room ."
307,"Original place near the two beliefs. Very nice and helpful owner . In the room and bathroom very clean . A nice surprise was waiting for us on the occasion of Valentine's Day - champagne. chocolates and a beautiful red heart on the bed A very original room, spacious with a small balconyBreakfast in Italy are for us very weak always. There are no vegetables, even a piece of tomato, a few slices of poor quality salami and cheese. A lot of sweetness but those of poor quality wrapped in foil. It's the only thing to correct in this place."

Nazarewski said that in one of the patients undergoing the procedure the aneurysm reached as much as 8 cm, although usually its diameter does not exceed 3.5 cm. The treatment of an aneurysm in the aortic arch (located in the mediastinum, between the ascending and descending aorta) is particularly demanding. ""The main difficulty is the precise placement of the stengraft in the right place, because three vessels are leaving the convex aortic arch: the brachio-head, left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery. It must therefore be positioned in such a way that the sleeves protruding from the stengraft are placed exactly at the point of departure of these vessels"" - explained doc . Jakimowicz ."
310,"Great location . Clean, very good beds, air conditioning, breakfast. Nothing to accuse. Staff availability. In particular, to thank the Lord who drove us to the station. Bravo! A chauffeur is available at any time. The prices are competitive with taxis. Breakfast is very tasty and generous. The beds are very comfortable . Air conditioning works without reservations. ( The heat was incredible )"
311,"It was the middle of the season and looked for a place to stay for one night. I walked 'em into the pizzeria on the first floor of the guesthouse to ask for a room. The man behind the bar asked by me said out loud, all the customers heard it: ""No, we don't have any free rooms! Don't you see the sign on the fence? There it says NO FREE Rooms ! ""Indeed, there was a small sign hanging on the fence, difficult to notice. I have never been treated so rudely before and nowhere else! It looked like I begged him for something. . . A very bad experience: ("
312,"After Warsaw and Cracow Motel One is to appear in other Polish cities. ""Our first hotel will be built in Warsaw, on Tamka Street. The next one will be Krakow - due to its potential. We would also like to enter regional cities such as Poznań, Wrocław and Gdańsk, but this is the song of the future"". Christian Lainer, Motel One development director for Central Europe, tells the daily newspaper ""Puls Biznesu"". The price ranges given by Lainer for the Warsaw facility do not deviate from the chain's standard and start at 49 euros. Tamex Inwestycje, the investor of the facility, is currently completing an application for a building permit and announces that it will be submitted by mid-year. At the end of 2012 the Motel One chain included 42 facilities with 9220 rooms."
313,"2 weeks ago I went with my husband on the weekend to this hotel, the receptionist asks us if we are from the GROUP, she wasn't nice and lofty, we got a small room just like the one in the room, in no way did she remind us of the pictures, we also went to an early supper, we got scraps of scraps of the day and scrambled eggs! while the other guys were getting normal food! Additionally, we were asked if we were with the groupon 3 more times, and when we checked out from the reception, the lady told us to pay 20 zloty for the drinks, which were even on the dinner plan, but we do not know what we paid for, because at dinner the husband asked if the drinks were included in the price, so only the alcohol has to be paid for, so he took the juice, and at breakfast we took 2 glasses of juice - but we had to PAY 20 ZL! I definitely do not recommend your hotel we felt like some homeless people at the banquet, they immediately showed their superiority, over us because we came from groupon! I ADVISE AGAINST THIS HOTEL AS A PEARL! ! !"
314,"The hotel as for its 3 stars ok are the small dummies 1 . the elevators are small and very hot in them if you run out of electricity and someone sitting in them is screwed. 2 often fades of energy are temporary disappearances but we have disappeared the electricity for 2 hours. 3 the way to the beach you go in with the heat and back under . The state of the sidewalks smudge massacre dirt is outside the hotel there nobody cares about cleaning the green pavements of the massacre . I'm going back to the hotel eating tasty only monotonous rooms cleaned every day employees super booze as much as you want. Such animations, although the children are taking care of themselves, I probably will never go there again, but I'm backing the little demanding and still in the sea full of algae."
315,"Nice doctor and nice to talk to him. A professional . You could say that I am his therapeutic success. After my depression there is no trace! No. . . . . .other life factors have also contributed to this. I'm not used to praise. . . . .because if the doctor falls into an unhealthy self-interest, who will take care of his therapy?"
316,"PLN 16 million of EU funding was granted to scientists from the Gdansk University of Technology, who designed and want to start building a prototype of an underwater hotel this year, the Ministry of Regional Development informed PAP. The EU funding comes from the Infrastructure and Environment programme. At the end of the last year, the Ministry of Regional Development informed PAP. Deep Ocean Technology, a company from Gdynia, which will be building an underwater hotel in cooperation with Gdańsk scientists, raised PLN 19 million for the project in a competition announced by the National Centre for Research and Development for funds from the Operational Programme Innovative Economy 2007 - 2013. The previously announced costs of the construction of the Water Discus Hotel were between 50 and 120 million dollars. Depending on the chosen design. The construction of the underwater hotel is to consist of two discs, one larger (approx. 30 meters in diameter), which will be located approx. 10 meters underwater and one smaller one (approx. 10 meters in diameter) on the surface. Each of the disks will weigh about . 500 tons ."
317,"My wife had symptomatic urological problems, the medical consultation consisted of transferring the case from urologist to gynecologist. None of them were able to determine the cause of the problem. A bladder cytoplasm was performed and the complaints stopped. Already after the procedure we were recommended to P . Wędzikowski, after consultation, said that he could not determine the cause in his current condition, but that the complaints will certainly return, because the effect, not the cause, has been treated. After 14 months the disease returned. We reported to P . Wędzikowski, the enormity of the tests that were performed on his wife was impressive (only basic tests were performed at the first attack of the disease). She spent 16 days in the hospital, but the doctor determined the cause, performed an operation and cured the wife. Professionalism, human approach, patience. I recommend"
318,"I don't recommend this lady. In the fifth week of pregnancy she received me on ultrasound, instead of saying that I did not see the embryo in the uterus she said that on her eye there are two but I have to come for another visit in 3 weeks time, then I will explain if the follicle is one or will be two. After a week there was a blotting, the doctor despite assuring that you can call her at any time and if she can't pick up the phone she will call back, she didn't pick up the phone not once, not once either. The pregnancy turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy, in the oviduct. With a threat to her life. The operation was performed to remove the fallopian tube and the bladder. The doctor himself couldn't have supervised to see the ultrasound and the description of what the doctor saw there. In addition, the card on which she wrote about the bladder, which was not different from the description of the examination, including: palpable breasts without changes. No breast examination was performed during the visit."
319,"She treated me with her for a couple of years and she didn't help me, and when she changed my doctor after a short time she saw me improve and now I'm 6 years without drugs and everything is fine. Dr. Ciborska treated me for depression and then by Dr. Kopystecka she diagnosed me with manic-depressive syndrome and from then on she changed her medication and above all she listened to me with her aggression and not like Dr. Ciborska to sell me out."
320,"She had a nasty contact with this doctor at Bielański Hospital. He confirmed a dead pregnancy with me. He treated me terribly. I do not mention the fact that the ultrasound examination (vaginal) was painful because without the use of gel. The worst was the mental experience. First she was sitting in a dressing gown for 20 minutes in a waiting room among people from the street because the doctor couldn't find the key from the office and then the annoyed doctor said that there is nothing to confirm because it is obvious that the child is dead. She did not expect any pity or sympathy from me because I understand that she was one of many but as we all know silence is gold and she would be very grateful if I did not have to listen to the doctor's comments at all. Now I have a child and when I was getting ready to give birth to the Bielanski Hospital despite the fact that it is very much appreciated, it avoided me from far away."
321,"Very poor service, unfortunately. Lack of menu (the best dessert is not available), untidy rooms (sic!!!), very reactive service - very disappointing. Absolutely not level 5 * sorry, because the location is beautiful and the architecture is very pleasant."
322,"The hotel is terrible, you can't describe it. Dirty, worms, not cleaned. There are no food at all, toasts with tomatoes for hot lunch. . . . What's on offer has nothing to do with what you'll see live. Not even for 700zl, I wouldn't go back there even if it were just a place to stay. I prefer to sleep in a tent."
323,"I had my breasts reduced by Dr. Pabianczyk in February this year. After the conversation I was very pleased and confirmed almost immediately the date of the procedure. Dr. Pabianczyk is a very competent doctor with a great approach to the patient. He explained everything to me calmly and patiently, answered all my questions, was patient and although I was naturally nervous, I felt very good as a patient. Even before the procedure, after and on every next check-up, I felt comfortable. All the nervousness disappeared. Dr. Pabianczyk is a young, gallant, competent and kind doctor. I recommend him very gladly: )"
324,"At first I was surprised that the bar is empty (I resemble a 4-star hotel). The mystery was quickly solved. . . . Generally, the hotel is an accommodation base for trips from all over Poland that visit the park in Inwałd. If someone wants to rest there in silence, he or she may be quite disappointed. The acoustics of the rooms are so poor that you can hear everything that is happening in the corridor and in the next room (not know why the rooms are connected by a door). As the door is a cheap piece of crap like many in supermarkets you can hear everything and everyone. Bathrooms in the rooms have a kind of threshold - which I don't know why, but if you forget, it hurts a lot. The standard is that you can't hear anything without any fireworks. It's pretty clean. Breakfast is quite decent and that's it. Mini SAPA and something like a playroom for children - my son didn't even want to go in there. In terms of exploring the park in Inwałd, it is better to ""embrace"" some agritourism in the area - it will certainly come out much cheaper and it is possible that the standard will not be worse. I don't know what these 4 stars are for, but for me it's more of a colonial center (really in the middle of a cloud of kids running in and out). But why?"
325,"If he wants to, he can get sympathies and trust. Unfortunately, his enthusiasm is not constant and when he's in a bad mood (or maybe he's in a hurry somewhere?) he feels like he's treating a patient from upstairs. The patient who is suffering has great needs and hopes that the doctor will really help him. This is not the first time I have been disappointed in Patryk Piotrowski. At a certain point in time, you actually help me. . . .but in the long run I do not recommend it."
326,"There is a permit to smoke in the entire building, which is a complete mistake when advertising yourself as ""child-friendly"". If you want to go to the sea to breathe fresh air, it's definitely not there. You can't open a window/balcony because there is a smell of cigarette smoke everywhere. Children are passive smokers. One reaction of the staff is a proposal to change the room (after 10 days of reporting the problem) without a guarantee that this problem does not exist in this room."
327,"I recommend tasty meals nice clean service, beautiful swimming pool and slides super drinks served, very interesting daily animation for children and adults, gymnastics in the pool, beautiful surroundings, close to the sea, to the beach, boat trips to the Mediterranean Sea, bathing in it, mud bath, crabs on the boat you can taste b tasty, views from the boat to the turtle hatching super terrain around for beautiful views we will return there next year."
328,"I highly recommend this game. Played 'em and passed 'em . Even though it's short, because you can knock it off in less than 5 hours, it's worth spending the money. Graphics, driving model, number of cars, maps, soundtracks, it's all a bust, and it's much better than the latest Wanted Bridge from 2012. The game looks really nice, it's impressive, except for the fact that the police cars probably have engines with N. A . S . And they can catch up with us even when we're driving 370km/h on a motorway without any obstacle: ) As much as I recommend this game, the 3 dots alone also offer a great price so nothing but take and play: )"
329,"Together with our partner we were at Mrs. Lisowska's house, Kania. First of all, we waited for hours in front of the office because she was mistaken for hours. Secondly, the meeting lasted about 35 minutes and she deleted it like in an hour. Unfortunately, she was not able to help us in our problem, although we thought it was not serious. We didn't get anything out of her visit."
331,"I keep the bicycle under the block chained with this chain, but unfortunately, after 5 months of use, the lock has jammed for amen. Despite many attempts, I cannot open it. Luckily, it got stuck when the chain waited for it to be attached to the stand, not when the bike was closed with it. The first problems started to occur after just 1 - 2 months. It jammed, once it walked better and once worse. It was exposed to weather conditions, of course, but such an armored chain is not to be carried in a backpack, but as a stationary protection for a scooter. On the plus side: I had confidence in him as far as the level of protection is concerned. Unfortunately, now it will be chained to the rack forever, because I do not even intend to try to fight with cutting it off."
332,"Indeed, Doctor, she is very essential. I had an appointment with her and she wasn't late, so maybe she didn't make me uncomfortable. At the visit I was thoroughly examined, the doctor explained what was going on and what could be done further, after the conversation she recommended further action. She cured my eye. So I have no objections."
334,"A very large and extensive hotel. A great place for holidays with children of all ages. There are many playgrounds, swimming pools, pool slides, lots of space, beautifully maintained area. The hotel is clean, the room is great, big. The service is very nice. The coolest barmaid at the bar with swimming pools and animation houses. The food is tasty, although monotonous - after two weeks it gets boring but that's how it is everywhere: ) There are also themed restaurants available for registration. During our stay it wasn't too crowded, but if you didn't book 7 sun loungers each, it was hard to get something together, we were there from May 28th for two weeks and people were arriving from day to day. The hotel is located close to the center, right at the exit of the hotel there is a stop. By bus because the center is a few minutes away."
335,"I am quite fresh after finishing the psychotherapy with Mrs. Magdalena and with a clear conscience I will recommend this psychologist to others. The problems, entanglements and blockages with which she started the therapy seemed to be very distant at the last session because thanks to Mrs. Magdalena they no longer concern me. Thinking about the sessions, what comes to my mind is first of all a nice and relaxed atmosphere, a great sense of trust, an incredibly individual approach and commitment. Apart from that, rich knowledge and a wide range of advice, suggestions that have never made me feel inferior or pigeonholed. I am still impressed by the empathy and feeling for Mrs. Magda. Thank you for this time and welcome!"
337,"A doctor not interested in the patient at all. She was sprayingly answering my questions about my health. 3 months of waiting for an appointment, which lasted only 3 minutes and she found out absolutely nothing. She got me only a prescription for drugs that I don't know what to do and why in total without a deeper diagnosis she got m antibiotics etc . She wasn't even asked what she was doing to cure her condition so far - maybe she was already taking the prescribed medication, but the Doctor wasn't interested. From what she heard in the waiting room it is unfortunately not only my opinion."
338,I recommend the Teacher's Pattern - he can convey knowledge in a logical way and at the same time he does not lack a sense of humour.
342,"I'm 174 centimeters tall, I'm of normal physique. Like a hopeless chair for me. Armrests are too high, which when sitting straight, causes the hands to be too high, there is no natural line and the armrests are not adjustable, stitching between the legs, which makes it necessary to sit apart all the time, which is uncomfortable, no adjustment of the seat, there is only a bulb and its location in the right position - it is impossible to adjust the hardness of the backrest or tilt it in any direction - tilt does not recommend all this. Sitting on it burns my ass, my back aches. . . A couple of lower people were sitting and comfortable. I wholeheartedly regret that he didn't buy 'em a regular or some volleyball one, but with a minimum of adjustment."
343,"Worst trip in 15 years ! The hotel deserves maybe max.2 stars. The food is good only on the day of arrival, then heated up, vegetables and salads supplemented with some fresh slices, the rest 2 - 3 days, the same wedding. Elevator total disaster! ! Nobody can set the temperature in the rooms. From 23, 5 - 26, 4! ! ! Restaurant and spa service is very good, the reception is no longer in the league, even the cheapest hotels can hire smiling, friendly receptionists. Surely the first and last time in this hotel"
344,"This morning we returned from the hotel ilios, two adults, 17 years old and 4 years old, as a revelation for us. The value for money is a plus. The hotel is clean, well-kept, intimate. Service friendly, swimming pools clean. Lezakow plenty, nice garden. All located in close proximity to each other. Homemade food, very tasty, always had something to choose from. Drinks without the frenzy - ouzo and Brenda, wine. All inclusive - three meals, drinks and after 16 - a snack in the bar in the lobby. You can rent bikes and a car on site, or in tigaki for already 30 euros (at Mrs. SANDRA - TIGAKI TOURS), bike for 5 euros. We recommend a trip to Zia. Tigaki is a great starting point for exploring the island."
345,"The first downside for unpleasant service . Arrived em on Friday and wanted em in the parking lot under the hotel to leave the car, and for the night's lodging to bike on Saturday . A very unpleasant lady from the service started to explain that usually the parking lot is full and I can not leave the car (lower and upper parking lots were almost empty) . However, I insisted, the car left 'em and the same empty parking lot found 'em on Saturday. Room with exit to the terrace, very nice, super climate, nicely furnished, comfortable double bed, everything is great, just that you can not sleep, and even a moment's rest, because outside the window are buzzing mercilessly fans from air conditioning. And a few words about the terrace, because even though it was August, the terrace is not cleaned at all, dirty tables, dirty chairs, dirty terrace, cobwebs on every corner. For this money, in this hotel, never again. . ."
346,"Another visit to the Centre . Not much change, but new reservations . This time I had the opportunity to live in a newly renovated room, so that there is really nothing to attach to. Infrastructure without changes, great moloch but friendly to guests. However, I can not not not write about the great (very unpleasant) surprise that has met me in the morning after a night full of attractions. At 7 o'clock and here behind the wall very loud breaking with a pneumatic hammer and drilling into the walls. Well, it seems to me that such things in a respectable hotel should not take place."
347,"With agritourism it has this back in common, that it is far from the centre. There are no regional, proprietary products that are included in the description. Breakfast without shawl, bad coffee. The facility has a stink, moisture and bad smell. Kidnapped bedding, towels from the Gierek era. Rooms need to be renovated. Large courtyard, attractions for children. Billiards are additionally paid. Generally not recommended."
348,"We were with friends for the weekend in this hotel, but we were disappointed, first of all, we still had problems with electricity, secondly, poor food, especially breakfast buffet - a small choice. As befits a 3-star hotel, the standard should be high, and here in the restaurant they sell Polaris ladybug water, which costs 50gr at a discount, and here it costs 5zł - laughter! ! ! In the rooms, the walls were cracked - we just hit the wall (room208), there is no air conditioning and I left my mobile phone in the room when she realized that I was not there anymore - the gentleman at the reception said first that they found the mobile phone and in a moment the thieves changed their mind. I honestly don't recommend it."
350,"Hello, I was at your doctor's house with your daughter's daughter who suffered from a bunch of vulva lips. The consultation was quick and she was given a brief overview of how to proceed with her daughter. She was cold and not very pleasant in relation to her daughter (and she is not all 4 years old). She was informed that I have to make an appointment for a procedure which hurts despite the superficial anaesthesia. She hasn't received any information whether there are any other ways to treat her in / out of her ailments. She consulted with another doctor and found out that it is enough to apply the right ointment for a few weeks and after the case, without any treatment or pain! I am glad that she did not listen to m . I am writing to protect others with such a problem from the senseless task of her child's pain!"
352,"She went to Dr. Monk's due to a hypertension problem. Something like, ""more sports, salt reduction"" - she knew that before she visited me. However, she also found out so much after the visit! Dr. didn't even measure my blood pressure! He just said that such a young body, that it is meaningless to give any pills, etc. despite the fact that for a month she felt terrible Of course you had to pay before the visit! so 230 zloty went wrong! ! ! ! ! the visit lasted 5 minutes! ! !"
353,"Dr. Wójs is rarely in the class he teaches, if it weren't for the fact that he is a very respectable scientist and half of his absence he can explain the long journeys and the glorification of the good name of our university - he would be a hopeless lecturer, and yes - force majeure, everyone is proud of him, even me. With credit he doesn't do problems, but for higher grades you have to know terrifying things. The lectures are interesting, although not always accurate and transparent, which makes a lot of confusion. . . Due to the small problems with passing I recommend to everyone, for talented students it is also an ambitious choice."
354,I consider the demand in this resort to be very successful Conditions super to everyone I recommend the service excellent including meals Conditions very good management perfekt to everyone I recommend a stay in this resort hosted em this with a family from Italy the second year from Rzed very satisfied Mrs. Manager very much Thank you very much you have restored my faith in the Poles whenever I will be in Zakopane I will always use your services The whole crew of the resort professionals I bow down and greet Jan Gabara
355,"I was with Dr. Szymula only once and fortunately it was the first and the last time, also I got to him because I have a subscription in LuX Meda and not knowing any doctor blindly I was registered with him. He was very unpleasant, arrogant, he asked strange questions that have little to do with gynaecology and when I asked him why he asked such questions he yelled at me that it is not me from asking questions but him. Already during this visit I wanted to cry, I felt so bad. After the visit to Szymula's, she had another very unpleasant story for me, he gave me a cytology, the result was tragic - Group III with oncological changes, I don't have to tell you how traumatized I was. She was surprised by such a result, because she did not feel any disturbing symptoms, she went to another doctor - Dr. Olszewska, whom I truly adore; - ) she did all the research, my neck was of course beautiful, my cytology again - and the group! ! ! I don't know how Szymula did this cytology to me and I don't think I'd rather not know, but the stress he experienced is something I will never forget."
356,"I recommend Dr. Tomasz Łabiak. He is a good specialist, he orders the necessary examinations; he repeats them if necessary; he orders the examination by doctors of other specialties if the proper diagnosis requires it; you can say ""cold blowing"". The doctor was leading my first pregnancy and when the results after the glucose test were abnormal, he informed me immediately and directed my treatment further. The doctor is not a talkative person, but he gives precise information on the questions asked. It would certainly lead me to another pregnancy with your doctor."
359,"The death of a guest in a hotel - both from natural causes and those investigated by the police - is fortunately a rare phenomenon. But what to do when it does happen? If, for instance, the room service provider suspects that the guest is dead after entering the room, she or he should immediately inform the reception. The reception must immediately inform the police. The hotel staff member (receptionist, manager, director) will give their personal details, a description of the situation, address of the facility and, if necessary, answer questions from the person accepting the call. It is worth remembering that there is already an emergency number 112 in Poland, but the police still suggest 997, or preferably the phone number of the police station or police station nearest to the hotel. According to the procedure, it is the police who notify the ambulance and both services appear at the hotel."
360,"Novotel Malta in Poznan is characterized by an excellent location near the Aquapark Maltese Therams. This location also gives the opportunity to quickly get out of the city avoiding traffic jams during the peaks. The object has recently undergone a slight renovation, the rooms have been repainted, all the furniture and beds have been replaced, unfortunately the bathrooms have remained unchanged, moreover, we will not see the air conditioning there, which can be cumbersome during the summer. The renovated rooms are cozy, clean and functional. The kitchen as befits this network is very tasty, breakfasts also deserve praise."
362,"Unfortunately, NEGATIVE, she was attending this doctor, trying to have a child - whole long months. Visits a few times a month, for every second visit he would come back with questions to the starting point as if she was with him for the first time. There were no records of my visits to his computer. On some visits between my words, he would answer the phone, one by one, and stop when, after another, he made a terrible mess of talking to me. . . He made two appointments with me at different times than his working hours and did not show up at all - because he forgot how he explained. . . She spent a total of 3 months on visits to this doctor. PLN 500 thousand . He ordered me to take hormones, never checking if they help me. I'm not pregnant until now. . . . . Luckily, I have now found a real doctor who, having done a comprehensive, very detailed examination, made a different diagnosis than the one she heard from Dr. B. - So no wonder that, despite the siphoning off a mass of hormones, the pregnancy was not: (I advise against it."
363,"The hotel is a terrible hotel, the staff is not nice, the rooms are cramped - no room for a suitcase, no air conditioning, no possibility of opening the window, dirty towels and bedding. I do not recommend this hotel, the worst I have ever been in."
364,"A double room overlooking the platform s-bahn and a pub where it was noisy at least until 3am, but it is a hostel, so it does not expect luxury and silence. Nistety was a bit cold in the room. The bathroom was miniature but functional: - ) . Breakfast is fine, coffee is fine. You can buy everything from the machine (food, drink, beer, cigarettes). WIFI did not work in the lobby or was very weak. Location very comfortable (trams, trains literally next to the hostel). Next to the hostel a good kebab with a nice service. Berlin is extra, the hostel is also ok, although it is not the first ten hostels in which it was m ."
365,"During the visit, this doctor was more interested in his phone than in me ! Instead of focusing on the examination without any objection or embarrassment he read incoming text messages ! ! ! ! ! Asking him questions, she expected me to have clear answers, but many times she simply dismissed me. . . After the last visit I am really disappointed. . . I don't recommend this doctor! ! ! ! ! ! !"
366,"The hostel as a hostel slept in the better ones, well that we got the ""apartment of a higher standard"" thanks to that it was quiet, I recommend for a very short stay without any requirements, breakfast well better to eat three steps away in the confectionery or in the cafe: )"
367,"A seemingly child doctor, the approach to children has how polite they are, and if they do not want to cooperate it is a visit in vain. Money spent, no research, no order for another visit. Maybe another time will do. A frenzied two-year-old didn't want a study. A private doctor can do this endlessly, I don't have the money to waste. Nice person and what we get after that: /"
368,"The hotel in the very centre of the city, the service is nice, but the key role in the journey is played by the hotel bed, which was terribly uncomfortable. The mattress terribly worn out felt ""bevels"", cushions terribly artificial and, in my opinion, too high (it was difficult to arrange them so as to fit at will), the cover - the duvet was terribly unpleasant. From the journey from Toruń, I came back unsleepy, marvelous. I do not recommend ."
371,"He stressed that this is a very important discovery which will be verified in the next research. ""We will also check it out among the human population. We have already signed a cooperation with the Cancer Genetics Laboratory in Toruń for tests on patients diagnosed with breast cancer. It is necessary to check what immune phenotype was present in these patients before the disease appeared and during therapy. We know from the genetic tests conducted by the aforementioned laboratory that there are changes in the genome in patients at risk and already suffering from cancer. In their genome there is a certain gene mutation. It is necessary to check how it relates to the immune phenotype, and especially to the number of cytotoxic cells in relation to cancer cells"" - added prof . Cossack ."
372,"My wife and I were in this hotel in mid-June for 5 days. Good and nice service, clean new rooms and sea views made it a great trip. To the center of the town goes 10min sea promenade. I hope you come back satisfied as much as we do. Go, check it out and have fun."
373,"I confirm, Dr. K. is terrible about his assistants, he has them too subhuman, he yells at these women even with patients, which proves a lack of professionalism. He treats them so that if you don't want something extra - an implant, a deeper canal to be treated, he also has us for nothing. For such a price, you can go to another better one."
375,"The location is an undoubtedly an advantage of this centre ""ANIMATIONS OF THE STOCK"" available only since 15 June is definitely too late and here the minus. . As far as eating is concerned, it is quite warm and tasty. The rooms are cleaned every day with air-conditioning and air-conditioning is too loud and the furniture may be classical but for me the summer holidays are already behind the SMOOTHER MINUS are the cups and actually the beer cups are enough to have about 200ml, so 70% of the rest is foam, so 3 rods and a trip to the bar for the next. . . I estimate the whole thing at 4 / 5. . Generally we are satisfied with 7 days spent in this hotel"
376,"Researchers have so far checked the physical environment of hospital rooms in selected wards in Polish state hospitals. For example, air temperature, air velocity, humidity and radiation temperature were examined. Researchers from the Warsaw University of Life Sciences also had many conversations with patients and staff. ""Since March, when the project started, we have examined over 20 hospitals - says Prof. Bogdan . - It soon turned out that the conditions in the patient rooms throughout Poland are very similar"" . The key problems related to the thermal environment faced by hospitals depend on the season. In summer the problem is excessive insolation. Patient rooms usually have very large windows, so the rooms heat up quickly. Roller blinds and blinds do not help. It happens that there are no blinds at all. The only way to save you is to open the windows, but this natural airing means another problem: letting in hot air and heating up the rooms further."
377,"The doctor looked at the MRI results, said it wasn't operated on and the visit was over. No recommendations, no suggestions (sciatica - it cured her effectively with physio- and physical therapy, but the Doctor did not even take up the subject). Another person wrote here that the visit lasted 3 minutes and the Doctor decided that it was not true. I wasn't looking at my watch, but the time spent in the office was between 2 and 4 minutes. I assure you that 3 minutes is a realistic estimate."
378,"I am placing a comment to warn or prepare other patients for humiliating contact with the doctor. Difficult and sometimes impossible to communicate. The treatment of the patient in question . Documentation, results and other papers are more important . Silence the patient, please remain silent. A very authoritative person, without the ability to talk or empathize. I do not go to the doctor to feel sorry for myself or to experience unnecessary stress. . I want professional service and not to be treated as a child or intruder from a position of power. I don't know about medicine, but I know where the limit to disrespectful, patronizing treatment of another person is."
379,"The hotel is perfectly located in the very centre of the city, where it is close to everywhere. Nice service, delicious breakfast, perfectly equipped rooms and bathrooms. If you don't have the power to explore the city, you'll be interested in the TV offer as well, because it's rich and there's plenty to choose from."
380,"Dr. Pawel Nachulewicz is a rare doctor who performs his mission with mission and dedication. In CM Sanitas in Lublin at the beginning of April he had cryptorchidopexy surgery on my son. I won't say, we were afraid of the operation, we didn't know how the anesthesia would pass, what will be the ailments after the operation. The tandem of doctors Dr. Krys and Dr. Nachulewicz turned out to be a very good team. They approached the small patients with great culture, tact, feeling and calm. The procedure went smoothly. Dr. Nachulewicz discussed the course of the surgery very culturally and calmly, Dr. Krysa perfectly informed about the anesthesia and possible consequences. Then everything went great. You can have 100% confidence in both men. They are real professionals, but most of all they feel the fears and anxieties of their parents. It's a shame that there are less and less doctors like that, but you have to be happy that you still are. After the procedure, both doctors were interested in patients, they came, looked after, really great respect for the approach to patients and their families. I recommend Dr. Pawel Nachulewicz with absolute certainty that he is the best pediatric surgeon you can come across. Oh, my God. Peter"
381,Don't go on the worst holiday I've had hotel squalid beds not comfortable with holes and sheets also towels are changed every 3 days by the cleaning lady every 3 days and it's very poor water in the pool icy bathroom with very poor or no sea ventilation far surely it wasn't 400m to the beach people booked themselves sun loungers at 6am this was a big surprise for me traveling a lot and around the world and never met with it I heard 'em but never saw 'em until this hotel in general we are very disappointed
382,"Alice ( 07 . 11 . 2016 ) This was the first visit. P . the doctor reviewed the documentation of the disease, examined me and commissioned another study . We will see what will happen during the next visit . Will Mr. Doctor make a diagnosis after seeing the tests ordered? The topic is b . difficult . I will be full of GREAT recognition for the doctor if he frees me from a chronic illness that has deprived me of any joy of life. My first visit was very positive, full of professionalism, high culture, made me fully trust in Mr. Doctor. More about my problem, after the next visit."
384,"A room about but 199 PLN without breakfast is far too much, the pool is additionally paid 15 PLN / person. Eating tragedy, breakfast 65 zł for 2 adults and 1 child, all the cheapest products from the ladybird massacre. The hotel has an offer on the group, but it does not apply on weekends what they do not write on the group. I do not recommend."
385,"I have some serious reservations about the visit. First of all, the Doctor did not focus on listening to me, which made the conversation chaotic and had to repeat the same things several times, besides the answers were not accurate and did not dispel my doubts (e.g. there was no question about the reason for the visit from the Doctor's side, everything was not revealed in turn, and the question about the alternative to contraceptive pills was not answered only by the name of other ""hormones""). Secondly, the basic examination was very painful for me (to the extent that she screamed me out of pain). Thirdly, she got a prescription for a vaginal medicine to which she was apparently allergic and for 5 days she suffered from a doubling of the disease (terrible itching) - I do not blame the Doctor for the allergy, but I think she should recommend me to check if I do not have an allergy, because it was a medicine that maintained its effects for 5 days after one application, so she had no possibility to stop taking it (I will add that it was quite an expensive medicine, about 40 zł). There are still good sides to the visit, namely, learning breast examination (this is the first of my 5 gynaecologists who explained the examination without asking for it)."
386,"I am not able to assess the doctor's expertise in terms of the accuracy of the treatment - you will probably see in a while. The doctor was very kind, she quickly accepted me with a toothache in a three-year-old, but as for me there is no approach to children. Yes, the beginning looked good - my son sat down on the chair, gave himself even for a moment to put the drill and let himself be drilled for a moment, but what happened next was a horror. The child was crying, he didn't want to let himself finish treating the tooth, and the doctor looked more scared than us. It happened that we healed the child's tooth by force, but probably the dentists will be scared to the end. They decided that my husband and I will not use the doctor's services any more, or at least I do not recommend her for small children. Unless you want your child to be afraid of the dentist."
387,"If you're a very partying person (I stress MOCNO) from dawn to dusk (literally because parties last from 12 o'clock in the day to 5 o'clock in the morning) with people screaming all over your throat, then this is the perfect hotel for you. However, when we came to Greece, we were planning to rest and sightseeing, not wild parties until dawn with a swollen pool. Right after the arrival of the ""charming"" lady from the reception desk requested passports from us as a deposit for possible damage. Then she offered us a ""brilliant package"" of 60 euros for air conditioning (hidden costs, because in a 3-star hotel you can not expect a click. . . . ) when they asked us if it shouldn't be standard in a 3-star hotel, the ""nice"" lady replied that we probably never had a holiday. . . . . .plus 10 euros for the internet, which only works in the reception area and the swimming pool, and you are advised to take a safe because the hotel does not guarantee the safety of things stored in the room. In addition to a mirror bed, a wardrobe and a shower (if you can call it a shower) you will not find anything else in the room (because TV and fridge are already standard above 5 stars: D . . . ) You can not count on sleep without closed balcony doors and stoppers in your ears. Breakfast that we bought along with the trip in the form of a buffet was not able to saturate even the eyes not even talking about stomachs. One type of minced meat, cheese. vegetables had a more extensive offer because the hotel offers cucumbers and tomatoes: D additionally flakes and hard boiled eggs, two types of bread, marmalade and so on. And every day the same menu. Of course you can buy yourself english brekfast (eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, toast and mushrooms) for 2. 9 euros, not much but why did you buy m bed & brekfast. . . . . In addition, there are banning signs everywhere even that you can not bring and consume food purchased outside the hotel in the swimming pool, resort . The owners were not very kind to us with grace, and we were responsible for it for all those who bought a TV set or bought breakfast from them, drinks were nice. To sum up, the hotel is a nice hotel for young people partying sharply for all others rather not very hospitable."
389,"I have always associated my diet with sacrifices, with giving up my favourite dishes until my first visit to Mr Kamila's - 7 months ago. As it turned out, not such a terrible devil. Mrs. Kamila made me realize what is important, namely healthy habits, the implementation of which in everyday life results in a nice gift in the form of losing weight, and thus, better mood and changes in appearance; ) The most important thing is that she did not have to give up eating what I like. The diet was arranged in such a way that it had everything that I like to eat in rational portions individually adjusted after analysis of my body composition. She started with a weight of 62, now it is 53 - 54 and I can keep it, thanks to the recommendations, as it turned out to be very banal. I recommend Ms. Kamila Wrzesinska with a clean heart, a slimmer body and a super feeling and healthy habits: )"
390,"Since 1997, I've been struggling with a nose fracture. In 1997 I also had an operation which did not help me much. All these years I was visited by many doctors - otolaryngologists. None of them were able to help me in any way, and the methods they proposed were puncture and invasive sinus cleaning through a hole in the jaw. . . They never decided to do it to 'em. All these years I couldn't breathe freely, I had very severe headaches, constant sinusitis, I had tonsillitis several times a year. . . The discharge wouldn't let me sleep. . . In May, a friend of my mother's recommended Mr. Arkady Castellan to me as a doctor who would certainly help me. He found 'em no . . . on the Internet and made an appointment for me. . . Immediately after examining me and looking at the CT scans, the doctor offered me surgery to clear the sinus estuary, reduce the auricles and plasticize the nasal septum. After the surgery the sinus was to be self-cleaned. It was the first time I met with such a quick, professional diagnosis. The procedure was performed a month later in the hospital in Dęblin. Everything took place completely painlessly under anesthesia. In the hospital, I spent about 10 hours. After taking the bandages out of my nose the other day, I found out how deep I can breathe. I am now 2 months after the surgery and I don't know how I could have lived with my nose so clogged up until now. The treatment applied was 100% effective. Mr. Arkady Castellan is a doctor worthy of recommendation. He is a reliable, competent, courteous and communicative man. I recommend him to anyone with a clear conscience. All my problems are gone. The difference that I felt after taking the dressing out the day after the operation shocked me. I greet the Doctor very warmly! !"
391,"Nice surroundings, beach, pier, peninsula all for walks. . . . .and the rest without comment. . . . .food, spa, service. . . . .reading other reviews, I feel like I'm unlucky (at least I hope so. . . )"
392,"The castle is very nicely renovated . You can see that the main purpose is hotel services. There is a swimming pool in the former riding school. In the carriage house hall, in the stable the reception. Behind the desks you can see from a distance the former horse mangers and tiles on the walls. There is one suite to be seen, stylised as old, if there are no guests in it. Guided tour about 30 minutes. A guide is designed to include a hotel advertisement with a price list or an offer to rent the castle rooms. Surroundings of beauty . Small park . Sightseeing price 15 PLN ."
393,"My first visit to the doctor and I am very pleased. It waited more than an hour in line, but I prefer the doctor to spend more time on the patient than on the detachable and time. She went with a rather embarrassing approach and the doctor took me in very well, calmly, she tried not to stress me, she advised me a lot, that even though she had been stressing me earlier with a visit to the gynaecologist, here I will not have any worries for another visit."
394,"The hotel used to have a 4 * * * * * but the times of glory are behind us. Beautiful location by a clean lake, quite spacious rooms, nice terrace, barbecue, a lot of space outside, generally the base is great, but . . . . .you can see that the hotel is underinvested, needs renovating. One room felt musty, but we were exchanged for another and it was ok. The food may not knock you out, but quite tasty, typical ""all inclusive"". The service was very nice and helpful. If someone is not going to spend time mainly in a room and at the pool, but outside, by the lake, or kayaking / water bicycle, then I can recommend it. Calm and beautiful views guaranteed."
395,"Here we return to the category of guests mentioned above. In the case of a justified complaint, addressed to us because the fault lies with the facility, we save the guest and ourselves in the following way. The positive handling of the guest's complaint has to take place on two levels: Therefore, we apologize for the situation directly, without any further ado. In this way we try to satisfy the emotional sphere. On the substantive level, we immediately take action - dealing with the complaint. Only at this point can we go to the higher instance without losing our image."
397,"I strongly advise against it. The Nicolas Willas Hotel is the worst of all the places and hotels I have visited in my entire, not so short, life. There are so many drawbacks and inconsistencies with the description of the hotel that it is impossible to list everything here. The rooms are very poorly equipped and have nightmarishly uncomfortable beds with protruding springs. The air-conditioning for an extra charge is unfortunately not working everywhere. The cleaning ladies, although nice, changed the towels not too often, maybe 2 x a week and they were not aesthetic. The smell in the room was not pleasant and even worse outside the window, especially in the evening. The view from the windows was on the fields as in the countryside and from there also came this unpleasant smell and a cloud of mosquitoes. On the balcony there were two chairs and a table that served only as a dryer for wet beach towels, because you could only dream about sitting in the evening, because insects could not live. The door, despite the terrible heat, had to be closed so that mosquitoes would not get to Wednesday's room, because they did not let you sleep so much they bite. The canteen and boarding was horrible and certainly it was not ALL INCLUSIVE . The food was not only monotonous and not tasty, without taste, but it was not even fresh, after which many times people had food poisoning. The emergency service was called to children because of poisoning. During meals there was at least 1 person called a guard, because he or she would make sure that nobody would take anything with them, not even water! The only thing that was tasty and safe was watermelons. The pool is not long with cloudy water 1,40 cm, through which you could not even see the inscription that was on the bottom. Where, in contrast, in the sea was so crystal clear water that you could see through it stones and rocks several meters deep. The bar by the pool was weak, you could drink coffee, beer and water which tasted like it would have been taken from the pool because it had a hint of chlorine. In the evening after 6pm there was something stronger, namely Uzo - aniseed and Crayfish - moonshine. Besides, there was some rotten wine which was disgusting. The only positive thing about this whole trip was the wonderful people who warned others not to poison themselves and help each other. Besides, the beaches are beautiful, but the pebbles are wonderful views. I recommend taking swimming shoes and masks with you because there is plenty to look at."
398,"I recommend a doctor with a clear conscience! ! ! ! He's led my three pregnancies. He showed great professionalism, empathy and above all care for my children. Once a month visits allow you to control and monitor the development of the Baby's actions, because on each visit I had an ultrasound which is a big advantage. I find the price list for Warsaw attractive. The solution was that we were in contact with the doctor and never gave me the feeling that I'm calling at the wrong time or that I'm interrupting. . . When he couldn't talk he just called back whenever he could. He is also a very respected doctor in the ward, which was also felt. We're very happy and he'll probably lead the next pregnancy too. . . Thank you very much: ) AGMJ"
399,"Unfortunately, I cannot give this hotel a flattering opinion. I'll start with the bathroom: so small that a slightly larger person can barely fit into it - sitting on the toilet you can easily hit the sink. Especially we didn't take shower gel, because we expected something to happen. We found two soaps soaking up the skin so dry that on the first day we went to a nearby shop to get the gels. In the room it's the same - a bed pressed into a recess and only one person has free access - the other one hits the radiator squeezing on his half walking sideways between the bed and the window - I weigh 50 kg and hit me twice on the reader, so the amount of space speaks for itself. The TV with prlu - very small - watching anything in it is no pleasure. Spring water - in short, tap water . Generally, the first thought after entering the room is - the hotel should be called at the president's (with a snack, of course) - in total, the senator also quite fit. The bathroom even looks like a youth hostel. For such a price it is very disappointing, because there are good hotels nearby. You can see that the occupancy rate in the hotel is based only on the connection with the spa with Irena Eris and the swimming pool. The food is also quite good. In addition, only the staff - nice and professional - mainly at the reception, food (4 +) and swimming pool. For this price? I do not recommend."
400,"Despite the knowledge that you undoubtedly have, you still have to have an attitude towards the child, which you certainly do not have, there is no idea of a treatment, he sends back with a grudge that we came too late and he will not help us today (I can see that this is probably the norm)."
401,"A very good dentist, I can sincerely recommend it. The doctor has a great approach to children, his son has abolished the first boring without any problem. An additional advantage is the monitor, a great idea with a choice of fairy tales. Sometimes the doctor had to talk to her son twice because he looked at the fairy tale like that? ? ? "" and I wasn't really nervous before the visit, it looks like it was probably just me. If anyone is thinking about choosing a pediatric dentist, Mrs. Agnieszka Roztoczyńska is the best. I'm glad that we chose her as a dentist. Additionally, she explained how to take care of your teeth and when to put yourself in control. Mrs. Agnieszka Roztoczyńska, thank you."
402,"Prof . Wądołowska points out in her statement for PAP that the beneficial effect on health depended on all products which were components of the pro-healthy nutrition pattern. However, each of them could participate in a different mechanism reducing the risk of developing cancer. One of them is the role of antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables as well as fruit and vegetable juices. ""Antioxidants called + scavengers + free radicals have a positive effect on the reproduction of healthy cells. Therefore, regular consumption of vegetables, fruits and juices can provide the body with a high antioxidant potential, which eliminates damage to important cell structures, so that no further stages of the cancer process occur"" - emphasizes prof . Wądołowska ."
403,"I was influenced by reading the book ""In the Trap of Thoughts"" and because of the depression, low self-esteem and low self-esteem as well as the disordered sphere of the past. At meetings held once a month, Mr. Bartosz explained part of the mental processes and encouraged the exercise. Some of them were difficult and required his courage, but he never imposed his position but followed my needs. Under the influence of the therapy, I found the values, goals and tasks of life and the therapy very successful."
404,"Super Hostel, at a good price. Very nice service, nice and clean rooms. Scented linen. Bathrooms cleaned daily. Location ideal, close to everywhere. Easy to get from the station because there is a metro station nearby. We've been gone a few days and we recommend it to everyone. We will surely return there."
405,"Doctors emphasize that unrecognized and untreated aortic aneurysms are very dangerous for the patient - especially since in most cases they remain asymptomatic. With time, they grow, weakening the strength of their walls, and this may lead to their rupture, bleeding and endangering the patient's life. It is estimated that in Poland an aneurysm located in the abdominal part of the aorta is affected by approx. 200 thousand people. Until 20 years ago, the basic method of treatment of aortic aneurysms was a complex surgical operation, risky for patients. Since the 1990s, modern endovascular treatment with the use of aortic stent grafts produced in other countries - available but relatively expensive - has also been successfully applied in Poland. Today such treatment in the field of thoracic aortic aneurysms is a standard."
406,"The construction of the Widewaters Group Inc. hotel in downtown Portland, Oregon, is scheduled to begin in early 2015. The hotel will open at the end of 2016, but is not yet known. As a member of the Hilton Worldwide group, Curio hotels will be able to offer their guests points as part of the Hilton HHonors loyalty program, in which over 40 million customers participate. The Hilton HHonors programme allows you to use your accumulated bonuses more extensively than any other loyalty programme and to receive rewards at more than 4000 hotels in 90 countries."
407,"Hello, and I totally discourage this gynecologist from coming in ! I went to see him because I was advised against it! I am 4 months pregnant! The doctor doesn't take me seriously at all! I feel like I'm even bothering him! If he asks any questions, he answers them in a mockery and a little bit, and this is not an acne test but a pregnancy! Last month, after a month's break between the tests, she asked me to do a test to find out if I will have a boy or a girl, he said that this test does not include NFZ! ! ! ! The office is up to 13, and recently I witnessed a woman call him and tell him it's up to 12! He stomped because he has a private office! Exactly as you said below, she sat in the chair for 3 seconds! A massacre! ! ! !"
408,"I was diagnosed only in the 10th week, before that he claimed that I have a cycle disorder and even wanted to write out medications causing menstruation, fortunately I did not decide. As the doctor who first diagnosed the pregnancy he wrote me in the bad card (later) the date of birth, although she explained to him that it is absolutely impossible, she could give me the date and even the time of the incident, later the husband left. He joked that my husband is not needed to get pregnant. She gave birth in 43 weeks (42 weeks and 3 days), the birth lasted over 24 hours, there was almost no water, the baby did not breathe on its own, they barely saved it."
409,"This was the first 5-star hotel that em was in, so I can only compare it with 3 or 4 stars. Unfortunately, this comparison is in favour of the latter, at least for business trips. With the advantages of a unique location and surroundings. This is impressive. The downsides, the staff who do not speak English, quite a limited choice at breakfast (so there is more choice in IBIS with 3 *), no iron or coffee maker in the room (although maybe five stars, such things are ordered in the room;)). I don't know how to do it with the attractions (swimming pool, spa, etc.) because I didn't use 'em. Generally speaking, as a hotel for the weekend is a great place, but if you choose to stay for a business trip you can find a better place."
410,"The rooms and the location are faultless, worse with all Inclucive, coffee or tea just for breakfast, the waitresses at each meal ask for the room number, and yet we had our wristbands, we felt like intruders asking for something to drink in the bar, even cola or juice caused a problem. Coffee advice should be bought in the shop - the kettle in the room works, bought wine is also the easiest to drink on the balcony, glasses also available in the room."
411,"Taking advantage of one of the accora's sales, they bought em a weekend stay in the apartment. And while the whole hotel has recently been transformed in Ibis Styles - and you can see it in all common spaces, it has not yet been possible to do so in the rooms. Or at least mine. The apartment was heavily worn out, the furniture was probably collected from three different hotels in style, and the person who designed the bathroom a little bit did not think about the ergonomics of using it. . . I'm not a big person, but I had to squeeze between the toilet and the bidet to get into the shower. I can't really imagine how an obese person would handle it. . . Not only to be negative about this stay, I have to mention breakfast and the idea of using the apple season - there were a lot of extra products (like apple pie or mousse) that were a nice touch at breakfast. To sum up, after the apartment and brand Ibis Styles expected me a little more, but it wasn't bad - only average. . ."
412,"In autumn, this effect - to some extent - alleviated the hole in the tourism market caused by the bad economic situation in Europe and the worsening of the country. It will also work in the years to come, but not in the way that many entrepreneurs expect it to work: it will not give a jump in foreign tourist arrivals and attendance, but it will add 1 - 2 percent growth per year. Among the prevailing trends this year, such as the development of the conference and leisure offer of accommodation facilities, the enrichment of equipment with digital, flat-screen TV sets, or a greater emphasis on training staff - especially in direct guest service, it is worth noting the Internet. The year 2012 in Poland is another year of growth in the number of people using the Internet and mobile technologies. These changes in the ways of communication have an increasing impact on the activity of accommodation facilities."
413,"I was treated by your doctor for a few months for a severe depressive episode after the birth. The doctor wrote down the medicines that made me feel great. However, as it turned out later, there was until the first severe depressive episode in a bipolar affective disorder (probably already revealed in high school), which was diagnosed by another doctor. The doctor is polite and factual . If you are expecting long discussions about your problems, I suggest you go to a doctor who is also a psychotherapist. The only thing I can accuse the doctor of is not recognizing the hypomaniacal episode in which I was introduced to by drugs. Everyone around me noticed my unnatural positive attitude to life (there were no problems that could not be solved for me at that time). Unfortunately, I still feel the negative consequences of the decisions I made at that time - this is what I feel sorry for. At the same time, I think that the doctor should carefully observe the patient's behavior, which unfortunately was missing in your doctor."
414,"It was the cheapest apartment at the time when you were 'em in L `Estartit, so I can not complain. I liked the location, because from the beach we were only a small park, and to the sea literally 150m. In the same supermarket building, so cheap shopping at hand. I also rate a large bedroom, a kitchenette and a balcony. Unfortunately, there are also disadvantages: Ugly bathroom, uncomfortable beds, noise outside the window, antique TVs. The reception desk is open only a few hours a day from 5 p.m., so after arrival you sometimes have to wait a few nice hours for the keys. Fortunately, there is no problem with giving away the keys - you throw them into a box attached to the wall of the building and after the trouble. Generally the value for money ratio is quite good,"
415,"The hotel is surrounded by a repair clutter, in the fridge to welcome moldy lemon, clogged sink in the bathroom, not working remote control from TV, to the second TV was not at all remote control. Entertainment to 22 . 30 (bar and bowling) is probably a little too early, a very unpleasant smell in the whole building, the situation is saved by the only very nice ladies at the reception."
416,"I went to Mrs. Mysterska's office encouraged by positive opinions over a year ago. The doctor listened to my problem and after 5 minutes, she wrote down the medication recommending that I use it for as long as my skin condition persists. The condition of my skin has worsened, but at the next visit I heard that it is temporary and will pass. Because it was only worse I changed doctor and his diagnosis was completely different. After a couple of days and a change in the way he was loosening, the condition disappeared. To sum up, Mrs. Misterska did not show her knowledge and experience. I lost time and money. I advise against it."
417,"We were in this hotel 2 weeks in June 2016. The only thing worthwhile there is the pool and nothing else. Everywhere, dirt, shit. The food was terrible, the worst was breakfast. For a few days the food was not in the restaurant room but in the pool room, without air conditioning, with dirty chairs, tablecloths and dishes and with wine in plastic cups because there were no glasses in the bar. The change to the dining room only after my intervention with the hotel manager and the resident "" 7islands "" . And those cards in the restaurant by the pool ! ! ! ! Only one ice for one person so when you have a small child you go twice. Snacks like hamburgers, bred dogs sandwiches in fact in all the same, i.e. sausage from breakfast, lettuce, cheese. . . . .the only good ones are fries. In the ""playroom"" for the children was a nest of wasps, which the employees took off after a few days of notification. The room was big but it was better not to look under the sheet, the bathrooms were awful, the toilet seats were too small, dirty taps etc . The fridge in the room even though it is paid for is all rusty. Of course, the wedding in the restaurant room despite the full occupancy of the hotel was also. But the island is beautiful, many bars, restaurants, souvenir shops. The hotel bus efficiently transported guests to the beach - hotel. I recommend buying a cruise to Kefalonia and a cruise around Zakhyntos and necessarily to Wreck Bay, although it is not always possible to enter the bay due to very strong currents. We have succeeded : ) We also rented cars to explore the island."
418,"She was a patient of Mrs. Mortimer's until last week. In fact, she may be a competent specialist, but there are a couple of ways to get money out of customers. In the last few years, okay. 12 months she was at your doctor's office about 5 times, which comes out once every 3 months and even more often. She did a lot of research, so the frequency of visits was explained by the necessity of their consultation and somehow I did not mind the fact that Mrs. Śmiertka wrote me a prescription for contraception pills for 3 months. When I no longer needed to go to her so often and I was running out of pills, I was at the doctor's on a cytological examination (for which she paid me, of course), so she asked me to write a prescription by the way (in fact, it was my doctor for a year or so, I often used to be a doctor, you know that the pills are suitable etc.). . ) but she heard m that she didn't come to see me, so I won't get a prescription. She asked me directly if I should pay 120 PLN for a prescription for pills, which are not cheap either. Mrs. Śmiertka's answer was unambiguous and firm: 'YES' . I was totally discouraged and after receiving the results from the last test (and here I have to make an appointment to receive the results!!), my leg will not stand in this office any more. After this event, I was reminded of one more thing, which earlier also somehow did not arouse surprise in me. When I first came to Mrs. Śmiertka, she used Yaz contraceptive pills, while the doctor proposed a change to Yasminelle, which were supposedly cheaper, but with the same composition. She agreed to change to Yasminelle, although I was very happy with the placebo pill system in Yaz. It was only on subsequent visits that she realized that Yasminelle pills are not cheaper, and she wrote down all the recommendations on how to use the medication, etc. on a notebook with the Yasminelle logo. . I know very well the system of paying doctors for prescribing specific drugs. ."
419,"Despite the noisy announcements, the programme is not so good. It has a few prepared templates and some additional graphics, but it works only with simple projects, with advanced ones without knowledge of HTML we can not cope. A lot to wish for leaves also the quality of the code we get, to be clear we have to modify it. The price of the program is not low, and for this price we can choose a much better product. I recommend only for those who do not require and begin to work with preparing simple websites."
420,"The hotel is located near the center of about 3 km, decent room equipment including kettle (tea, coffee) and water. Nice service at the reception. Breakfast is quite decent, unfortunately, problems with cleaning the room during breakfast. In minus the shower in the bathroom a lot of fungus on the joints which spoils the overall good look of the room."
421,"I strongly advise against seeing this ""doctor"". My visit lasted about 10 minutes. The problem with which I reported myself unfortunately this lady did not solve, so I had to go to another ophthalmologist, who proved to be much more competent. The examination was done very briefly with the ""watch in hand"". In addition, the office lacked basic equipment (in my case there was no ultrasound device . . . ) . Of course, the doctor recommended a friend of the ophthalmologist who has an ultrasound to whom I would report for an examination and then again to her to interpret the results (i.e. I pay 2 times). As far as the cost of the examination is concerned, he paid em 110 PLN for his ""extremely"" bringing the visit. I do not know if it is much or little, but in my opinion it is definitely inadequate to the quality of service."
422,"Price/quality ratio as acceptable as possible. Good location, close to bus stops and the center. And probably so many advantages. Historical bathroom - setting the temperature of the water in the shower borders on a miracle. The cleaners want to rule when a guest has to leave the room. The food is monotonous and not very varied - for a week there was no Maltese dish at all. WI - FI ( paid ) Plus a little bass on the roof. The minus is the lack of a place where you can sit with your friends in a larger group. Will I go back there? If I go there, yes - in a hotel on vacation I sleep and eat and what I have there is enough for me."
423,"At first sight, the hotel is great. The charm passes after a stay in a restaurant, lobby bar, pool or spa. In each of these places it is very noisy and you can't even talk. The acoustics of the whole hotel and the underground where all the attractions are located are to blame. The walls and flooring are built of stone, which causes a giant echo. In addition, sitting in the lobby bar you can witness the transportation of various types of furniture (tables and chairs) that are worn between the bar and the tables. Dinner in the form of a buffet for 70 PLN per person is a pure mockery. The buffet offers meals rather not too expensive flights and is certainly not worth its price. Paying 600 PLN for two people, for 1 night, they got 'em in exchange for a room to sleep, two meals, a small spa treatment. They didn't get 'em: climate, silence, relaxation, good food. For this money there is a much more interesting place for a weekend."
424,"Very positive impressions after staying in this hotel. Rooms are spacious and very well equipped . The service is nice and the restaurant serves great food. A big advantage of a good location . Close to the forest and lake - really very nice surroundings, and not far from the Tri-City. I recommend both for family stays as well as for company or business meetings."
425,"I booked a stay in this facility by Booking, on the spot it turned out that there is no room offered to me, I was offered a room without a window outside, dirty not cleaned I don't know how long, with the bed for children falling apart, towels like floorcloths. Tregedia and cheating. Booking moved me to another hotel under complaint. The pictures speak for themselves best are the blinds and the window in the trash can."
426,"Course: organic chemistry I and II (lecture) Evaluation: I recommend [ / b ] The professor is nice to students, although sometimes it is difficult to find him. With credit there is no problem (unless one has organic oils from top to bottom) - on colloquial tasks from the lists solved during the exercises - a theory exam, but simple - for years the same, on the second date tasks identical to the first one. PoLeCaM ! ! !"
427,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this facility, a place where the staff is pushy, sitting with guests and watching all the time, a place where in the room regulations there is information that they can enter the room at any time in the absence of guests and where it says that they are not responsible for things left in the room - this is some kind of nonsense! ! Around the object one big mess, toys on the playground dirty and destroyed, in the motel unfortunately, but there is an intense smell of burnt oil (by the way, fear of eating something from such burnt oil) and even the air fresheners set up do not help, and it would be enough to close the door to the kitchen and install decent ventilation. The rooms are cramped, not the first freshness, the bathroom is small and not very well decorated, the towels are unfortunately not fresh! There were 'em two nights with the bride and groom and we will not come back again. Breakfast is not necessarily fresh, lunches are better eaten in another place. Besides that, expensive."
428,"Great animations for children, good food, beautiful dining room, swimming pool - this made us spend our holidays in Primavera for several years. We have always been accommodated in Building A. This time, after our arrival, it turned out that we have a room in building B (which nobody informed us about when making the reservation). It seems no difference at all, because the standard of the room was similar to the rooms in building A - but we felt it like a reduction in the standard of the hotel (and the price was not lower). Instead of using a beautiful, renovated restaurant as before, we ate in dining room B - a conference room with tables. . . Instead of going straight from the room, in a bathrobe, we went to the swimming pool. . . . .we went through a very cold link several times a day (connecting building A and B). We came home sick."
429,"I like being in palaces and discovering old history. I have a bit of a problem with the evaluation of the Palace in Gąski . The place has potential . The rooms are clean, but there is no finishing touch. Because as I have recently found out the palace has a new owner - a lot of work ahead of him to be able to say about you place - a real palace. Tasty meals, friendly service. Beautiful trees in the park - you can relax and meditate. On beautiful sunny days your stay can be very successful. On rainy days - you can play ping-pong and billiards. The library is missing. - A few books - and a huge change . Unfortunately, the surroundings of the palace is an old, deserted state farm, so it spoils the effect of the whole. The palace is located 2 kilometers from the sea, which is not an obstacle. however, access to the beach in Gąski or Sarbinowo can be a challenge. the lack of a safe road both for walking and travelling by car. I think that the hosts of the municipality have a lot of work to do . There are many tourists on the beach - so the municipality should take care of good and safe access."
430,"This is our second visit to this city and, consequently, the hotel of the Accor chain, also this time on the occasion of the ongoing Jagiellonian Fair. We even received the same room, although there were some adventures (replacement of the reception desk). We were also surprised by the lack of a coffee machine (available only in the apartments - we did not receive it, which was explained by the higher price; it seems to me that in this case should pay attention to customer loyalty rather than just the amount paid beforehand). The service is discreet, rather older, not very obvious (a small dispute in the restaurant about pouring beer properly on the wall). The second stay made us a bit more demanding - maybe unnecessarily. The ladies didn't ask us the next day whether to clean the room, which was explained by a hanging on the door. During a visit to the gym (modest for such an object), we noticed an empty water dispenser. Despite these drawbacks, the whole stay was a success, mainly due to the charm of the city itself. The next, third stay in this place, we will think longer."
431,"Everything would have been very good without my breakfast. A few days before arrival she reported my problem with quite a specific food intolerance to the restaurant asking if they can prepare something good for me, she got me a positive answer and a no. for breakfast reservations. On the spot it turned out that nobody knew about anything: ( . . . ."

435,"Disappointment of the year . The hotel is dirty, located at a busy crossroads, at the entrance you can break the suspension, such holes. Breakfast has not improved the rating, few fresh products, not to mention the dining room design. Bathroom in late rococo style. I advise against it."

Fortunately, they were bought in a local supermarket and got em a cash back (51 PLN) on the day of the complaint. I was disappointed in Philips because 20 % of the unreliability to too much for such a brand . After about a year or so another light bulb started flashing, but with 1 complaint left em a receipt in the shop so it's hard to say. I have mixed feelings because my friends bought LEDs from no name companies and they have no problem and I compared them overpaid 'em and bought 'em a bubbling Philips brand product. . ."
437,"""Allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, lupus, multiple sclerosis are very dangerous diseases caused by excessive activity of the immune system. There is an increasing incidence of some of these diseases. This trend is particularly visible in developed countries"" - says PAP Dr. Piotr Bąska from Warsaw School of Life Sciences. A remedy for these diseases may turn out to be . . . . .parasites, because in order to survive in man, they had to learn how to inhibit the action of the human immune system. ""In the course of evolution, they were our inseparable companions, becoming - like some saprophytic bacteria - a teacher of the immune system, so that it would not be overactive. Everything was fine until the beginning of the last century, when the standards of living and sanitary conditions of the majority of the population were not too high and antibiotics and antiparasitic drugs were not used as often as today. Parasitic invasions were the order of the day then. Now, in developed countries: Europe and the United States, we got rid of some of them. As a result, our immune system does not have a teacher to stop its antics"" - explains Piotr Bąska ."
438,"I consider the DOCTOR to be the BEST and BEST COMMUNICATIVE LEADER I know. When she was in my knee after the surgery, he took care of me, he was interested in my therapy and progress. I recommend to everyone, if there is something wrong with someone, I recommend to refer to this particular doctor. He can be charmingly kind."
439,"She's not a nice person, she answers questions with grace. She is clearly dissatisfied with the fact that I have a lot of marks and she wanted me to have a look at them. Generally, she is trying to get rid of the patient from the surgery as soon as possible. As a result, some of my peeps didn't even look at it. In addition, she had another skin problem with me. She looked at the problem and said, ""I won't do anything about it. "" In a word, a mistake and a waste of time."

441,"We don't send stupidity: ) One of the facilities of the Ace Hotel chain runs an intriguing promotional campaign. New York Ace Hotel invited 12 writers to spend the night within its walls. Then they shared their impressions with selected guests. Of course, in writing. The writers will be invited every month of this year to spend one night at the hotel. They will then write a letter to potential new guests. The letters will be left randomly in the rooms. To add another note of uniqueness, they will be additionally hand stamped and numbered ."
442,"The first time I came to see her 3 years ago was actually by accident (having a trauma after the first visit to another gynaecologist). She was incredibly patient and gentle. She listened to me and explained everything thoroughly. I recommended the doctor to a few other acquaintances, who were also delighted with the approach, knowledge and empathy of the doctor, who is a 300% doctor with a real vocation, for whom the patient is most important and not the money (as for many others). I wholeheartedly recommend and thank you (I will certainly not replace the Pauline doctor with any other gynaecologist) Anna W . K"
443,"You can leave Eve's office very pleased. In my case, it was so until I read other opinions and consulted other specialists. Indeed, the doctor has a ""different point of view"" and a very ""psychological"" approach to the patients. It explains everything . . . . The point is that everyone without exception says the same thing! ! ! ! ! ! The usg does, too, but she can't see anything in it! He is inventing his own theories, how can such a doctor still have an office? Notice that he works for two hundred hours and the patients are scheduled every 15 minutes, it is not normal. . ."
444,"Hello, last year he would have gone to Kiev and looked for 'em for a decent night's sleep. I caught my eye Magic Bus - at first glance, the same advantages. Affordable prices, location in the very center of Kiev. I come Monday morning (I'll just mention that I booked 'em earlier). No one answers the intercom. Also on the phone (called em about 2 hours in a row) . Finally he wrote 'em to the e-mail service. Guess what - they replied after 3 days, when I was long gone in Kiev ! In a word tragedy . . ."
445,"I strongly advise against it! The doctor approached me in a very schematic way, each visit lasted a maximum of 10 minutes, including the first one, during which a detailed interview should be collected. This is not the case here. The doctor did not make any observations, almost every visit she heard that the follicle is small or there is no ovulation, but after the change of doctor it turned out that in my case ovulation is unusually late (25 day of the cycle). She was taking a lot of drugs without explaining why, without success. I definitely lacked an individual approach and at least some attention."
446,"Hi I do not recommend the hotel for several reasons I had the opportunity to stay cheap for a couple of days and this is one big nightmare. There is practically nobody at the reception desk because the girls who work there are one day I see the lady at the reception desk for a while and then I see her serving breakfast and to make it funny after breakfast she goes to clean my room and other rooms. . . . . .surprised the girl that they work there. . . . . .a lot of staff shortages, which makes this hotel a mess! At the reception desk, dirt such as when you sit there, it's insects that have died, dust dirty windows and that's all over the hotel! People, hire more cleaning staff, fill up the kitchens and give somebody to be at the reception desk all the time! And he will definitely want to go back to that hotel! Because I won't go back there anyway, as you can see from the opinions, so will others! Avoiding the hotel with a wide hatch!"
447,"I have been instructed by your doctor and am very pleased with his level of knowledge and competence. For 2 years, my husband and I have been trying to get a child, and Mr. Doctor is thoroughly examining and looking for a reason. During the examination, he explains and explains everything thoroughly. He adopts an action plan for the nearest future, so that the patient can properly prepare herself. This was the case with HSG sono examination and hysterolaparoscopy. I hope that with the help of your doctor I will be able to get pregnant soon. With a clear conscience I can recommend Dr. Wojciech Rawski to every lady and also to future mums."
448,"I got a copy with a malfunctioning SD card reader, the card does not slide out after pressing and you have to pull it out forcibly, it is so inconvenient that when using micro cards with an adapter you obviously pull the card out of the adapter with then the adapter from the reader. The laptop was obviously in service, but I quote the technicians did not confirm the reported fault, this probably means that such operation of the reader falls within their standards. I was expecting a higher quality of this equipment and I am disappointed."
449,"I've known the doctor for 4 years, the first time he really helped me. Now he's also helping me, but I've got some dissatisfaction. I get the impression that the doctor went for the number of patients admitted and not for the quality of visits. I'm not a stroke of heart at the visits but at the last one I really wanted to talk, unfortunately the doctor interrupted me at some point, wrote prescriptions and didn't even say goodbye. Currently I am wondering if there is any sense in further visits, because paying 150 PLN for just writing a prescription does not satisfy me."

451,"They bought us a Frida nose before our son was born. In general, she bought it after she had read a whole lot of positive opinions, well ... It is certainly better than a pear, but it is not suitable for people with weak lungs or those whose vision of inhaling cold and germs scares (let's not hide that the germ sponge will not stop). It only worked for us until one moment - very quickly the son when he saw it started to cry and was terrified - we quickly came to the reason why it was happening: just during the ""inhalation"" of the rhinitis we were making such a disturbed and stressed face that he himself started to be afraid ... So I warn you to be careful. After we started to be careful with it, my son stopped being afraid - only that with ""age"" the rhinitis was worse for him - and then we connected Frida to a vacuum cleaner ; ) I generally recommend it - especially for small children."

The doctor explained to me what mistakes I can make and what can happen to me and why.

453,"A pleasant place for a weekend outing . However, no longer, because for the non-motorized there is not much to do there in the long run. The same opinion met with em before the arrival and it was actually apt because it considered em a week-long overnight stay in this place, but 3 days were enough to visit the whole area and local bars: ) A hotel like this. I think it meets the 3 * . The restaurant's exceptionally nice service, a total lack of competence on the part of the cleaning staff. Remember to book your bikes or sanatorium during your stay in advance, because the nobility of the capital will kill each other at eight o'clock in the morning to have everything just for themselves: ) PS: Take care of the maids. They will do their best not to tidy up your room. PPS: I think that following the above advice your stay should certainly be a success, because the hotel itself is really fine: )"
454,"I'm not a very demanding person, but I was waiting for 2 years while going there, I was very happy that Kolobrzeg and what I was offered was the worst in every way,,,,, my and every expectation.

I'm not only writing on my behalf of the general public, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . Nothing to add to the thread of mercy. The weather and the sea compensated for the stay. . . , Kołobrzeg is beautifully situated, I like to stay there."
455,"Way one - do nothing. Despite the fact that the hotel is not small, there is incredible silence around. There is a lake on both sides of the hotel, a pleasant tavern where you can spend days on the bridge. A large selection of dishes on the menu, a well-stocked bar and, rarely, a cigar smoking room. The second way - actively. Our children had plenty of attractions at their disposal. Brilliant electric boats to explore the area from the lakes, canoes, water bikes, regular bikes, seagways, swimming pools, bowling, golf simulator. Every day we did something and always had fun."
456,"A beautiful neighborhood, a large hotel, remembering the times of prosperity. Everything used to be probably on a high level. Nowadays, a hotel needs a professional approach and money to raise it to these three stars. I do not recommend an autumn-winter stay. Heating problems (you can possibly count on a fella at the reception if there are not many people willing to stay). Hot water can be forgotten (barely lukewarm and after a long drain from the tap - pure waste! ) . The water in the pool of quite a suspicious quality ICE - even my husband couldn't immerse himself. The service is not very professional, probably students from a round-up, they have to keep a good face for a bad game. The plus is that they deserve spacious, ugly rooms and a kitchen. The dishes are really tasty, the choice is a bit small and the temperature of the dishes is unfortunately often summer. The bowling alley, the fitness room and the bowling alley aren't really good. In total, I do NOT recommend it! ! !"
457,"After 2 years and 2 months, the duroplastic board (flap) broke while sitting down (i.e. normal daily activity in the toilet) - 88kg. From the very beginning it was very difficult to set it to fall evenly in line with the edge of the toilet bowl. Conclusions: for such a heavy flap there should be a system of slow descent on both sides of the flap's mounting; the upper part should be lighter and not necessarily made of duroplastic but of a more flexible material; the designers did not think about the small convenience of a profiled small wrist recess to lift the flap. The point I can make is that the fall worked, that the hinges were chemical resistant, for the look. A point for those who have thought about the guarantee that the product can spoil after this period."
458,"It's cheap, it's true, but still it's worth looking for a minimum of expensive and more comfortable accommodation in the area. A room soaked in the smell of cigarettes, toilets in the hallway in the form of inserted, ready-made cabins - toilet and shower separately. All Poles WC will immediately be associated with the toilet design in the PKP, looks the same and discourages the same. Hotel for 1 night and only in case of unavailability of other nearby facilities."
459,"The hotel is very nice, the rooms are clean and at the right level, the bathrooms are also. The area of the hotel is perfectly developed, lots of greenery. Large swimming pool. Daily animation from morning to late evening. The food was very good, there was plenty to choose from. A large selection of spirits and drinks. Very nice service, helpful from the first moment of your stay in the hotel, starting with the managers, bartenders and ending with the cleaners. Always smiling and trying to say something in Polish. Thanks to your manager Edyta. In the hotel most of the holiday-makers are English, but the Poles were also Polish. Near the beach, to the center 4 . 5 km but there is a bus near the hotel and there is no problem to get there. Very positive impression, I highly recommend this hotel."
460,"The visit lasted less than a quarter of an hour. The doctor, although kind and polite, did not help me. She went to see me because of a recurring headache, problems with balance and nausea. Apart from the banal study of reflexes, no specifics. She found out to me that ""it would be good to do an MR"". That is, as much as my family doctor told me. I'm spending 120 pounds of money without any sense. The consultation neither calmed me down nor gave me grounds for any treatment. A great minus for the conditions. The temperature in the office is scandalously low (about 10 degrees C). Unfortunately, but I do not recommend it."
461,"Very nice guest house, 7 min walk from the beach with nice service and good, fresh food. A slight minus is the loud music from the neighboring plot on weekends, but the windows are quite well muted. A small carnival just next door didn't bother you, very few people went there."
462,"Two pregnancies and 20kg of ballast. She sewed herself into my house in the conviction that it will probably stay that way, that I will not manage to be a happy woman again in my beautiful dresses. The dresses she changed me for tracksuits and a big sweater under which she hid what she was most ashamed of m and hated m . The more pounds I had, the greater was my frustration to live, my reluctance to go out to people. A few things happened to give myself a chance to restore my happiness. ""I shaved"" Mrs. Mariola. She didn't think I'd fall off my weight so easily. I eat what I love, I don't have to die on weird diets. The nice surprise for me is that the diet can be so balanced that I'm not attracted to the sweets that she ate a lot recently. Meetings with Mrs. Dietetik are pleasant because I do not feel embarrassed, I can tell you about everything that lies in my heart and it additionally makes me lighter. I am happy again : ) and my children and husband too. Because a happy mother is happy everyone around her: )"
463,"Chosen by tripadvisor because he had good reviews. The linen was dirty, the cabin was also clean and did not shine. The car park at the hotel for such a price is a slight exaggeration and yet additionally paid breakfasts, where at the descent on them at 9 o'clock was not too much to choose from. The hotel's parking lot for this price is a slight exaggeration and additionally there was a breakfast payable at 9 a.m., where there was not much to choose from."
464,"The location of the hotel itself is very average. . If you don't have a car, you have to reach the tram terminal from where you can get to the centre of Wrocław (e.g. Galeria Dominikańska) in about 25 - 30 minutes. It already makes a small expedition. The food is very tasty in total, I have nothing to complain about. The rooms are of very average quality. Some of them are supposed to be renovated, but sometimes you have the impression that it was not there at all. Unfortunately, I was allergic to water in the hotel. . . .after just a few days she had an unpleasant allergy to the body. . . ."
465,"Apartment located quite high but with what a view . You look at the beach amadores . The pool is quite large . Spacious rooms , bathroom with bath and shower . Clean - neat .

I was referred to a neurologist by 3 specialists because I have several symptoms that would need to be checked for this. The doctor looked only at 1 / 20 of the documentation, asked to touch the finger to the nose, walk in a straight line - the end of the examination, no questions and only the statement: ""looking for diseases is also a disease"" . She received a note to the psychiatrist (I'm staying insomnia), he said ""let's not force the doctor since he already made a diagnosis"" . . . . Mr. Dr. . . . ...bad humor, hard day? No excuse. . . . . .where's the professionalism you're writing about? The patient being treated in a subjective manner? ! . . . . . .

468,"The Pod Brzozami Castle is undoubtedly a very interesting place and a nice idea when it comes to the construction and furnishing of the object. In this respect it is really impressive and nice to spend time in the "" castle scenery "" . Personally, however, I went there with 2 children aged 3 and 5 and this is not the best idea. Despite the fact that we chose the largest chamber, i.e. the Avatar, there was a little consternation when it turned out that the extra beds are not prepared despite prior reservation and e-mail confirmation. However, in the end they appeared. . . . one cot and one portable pink baby cot with information from the lady who served us that it would be good for our boyfriend: ) Complete perplexity . . . What's more, you have to have eyes on literally every side because a nice idea for the Castle and its good execution have been combined with a total lack of imagination when it comes to the basic usefulness of the facility visited by families with children. All the floors in the Castle are hard, despite the snow to the knees in the whole building ZERO any wiper that you can wipe your shoes with, the snow on the access and stairs does not bother anyone in this castle. The peak of mindlessness is the high staircase without any railing from which young people can go down once and for all. In a word, as for me, a definite excess of form over content and an object definitely dangerous during a stay with children - what is more, it is not suitable for such visits, for example because of the rooms in which there is usually a single ""bed"". If you come tired in the evening and the door will be locked, do not worry. In our case, after a few minutes and a dozen or so phone calls the door has finally opened. . . Oh, if you are planning to order a romantic room decoration in this Castle you must have a great sense of humor because the beautifully presented rose petals, which were scattered all over the chamber and furniture before our arrival are made of ... . red material and try not to ride on them, because they catch the slip until nice. I recommend that you clean them before using the chamber. In a word: it's worth seeing, it's not worth spending the night with children, it's worth visiting the two of them with their own flakes to decorate the chamber: )"

I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and actually ended up with it. Dr. Sadłecki listened very carefully to my problem and immediately took matters into his own hands with great commitment. He directed us to a number of necessary examinations where the previous doctors did not even mention them, he explained exactly what my problem is and how we will treat it. At the beginning of June I will have HSG treatment and then further treatment. I believe that with the help of Mr. Doctor, soon my husband and I will see the little one. The examination is not stressful I recommend! ! ! !"

The idea, supported by concrete actions, including financial support, has turned into a patented, unique in the world, technology for the production of liquid crystal emulsions and matrices of thermocrystalline film"" - says Dr Jaremek ."
473,"Based on a direct relationship and offering immeasurable services where the reputation and opinion of the guest is everything. I will give a negative example . When asked to engage the guest (response, action) we receive an unpleasant feedback . Let us point out that here I mean factual and tactful expressions of one's own opinion, not a hey. The most common response of the hotels is to counter and / or remove uncomfortable content. Either we care about the relationship with users (potential guests) and accept them with the benefit of the inventory, or let's stop such actions. This is a wider problem because it usually results from the lack of preparation of a marketing strategy for the facility and its services as a whole."
474,"assessment: I'm back in spite of the funny walk and appearance I recommend, contrary to the panic, the problem is presented much better, often wrong when checking so it is worth to go to the consultation under the wheel and sometimes it is possible to hatch something in this case 3 points saved my ass and I passed the test."
475,"In the last two years, she has miscarried three times. At the beginning of the year, we were desperate to get a doctor. We performed expensive examinations (over 5000 PLN in cash, without a receipt). After they were done, the doctor recommended: Clexane injections, intravenous infusions of immunoglobulin and vaccination with the husband's lymphocytes. We did not decide to undergo this treatment after consultation with other doctors. Eventually, I went to a wonderful doctor from Poznan, who recommended me to switch to a gluten-free diet and Clexane injections (that's all). I am now in the 12th week of a properly developing pregnancy. Before you undergo treatment at your doctor's, please also check what are the actual recommendations of the medical associations he refers to - ASRM and ASRI ."
476,"A great place to rest . Hotel located 100 m from the sea in a quiet area. Beautiful garden and swimming pools . Rooms are clean, cleaned daily. The food is a fairy tale, varied and very tasty, and all this with a very nice and friendly staff. Hotel Kalimera Mare is a great place to spend your dream holiday. Thank you and greetings"
477,"The hotel where I am very fond of is situated in a nice place by the sea which is close to the hotel which has lots of swimming pools of different depths where you can bathe to your heart's content the food is tasty and the service which cleans up on the running are different games for adults and for children there are bars where you can buy or get different drinks and snacks a bit is not enough bars. They should be in every pavilion. When it comes to air conditioning in the main corridor, there is practically no air conditioning. There are a lot of pools of different depth and size and greenery which looks nice with the hotel. The communication is good . Kemal"
479,"A person may explain it all and somehow it's all explained and the wheel does quite easily, but it's terribly boring, to sleep is really easy. Besides, she's served and even wasted time on any negotiations with him. Generally it's not the worst, but it's not great."
480,"Dr. n . med . Piotr Kramarz from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that Poland is one of the countries with average HCV incidence. These include the Scandinavian countries, Germany and France. Most people are infected in Southern Europe, especially in Italy and Romania. ""Poland stands out because many people infected with HCV do not know about their infection,"" said Dr Kramarz. In the European Union, on average, 50% of those infected do not know about it, while in Poland - about 80%. Prof . Budkowska pointed out that curing people infected with one HCV genotype does not protect them from infection with another variety of this pathogen."
481,"She was with Dr. Barcikowski twice. One time with a referral to hysteroscopy with a diagnosis of haemorrhagic menstruation . Hysteroscopy showed nothing. The second time she was m after six months because her hemorrhagic menstruation did not stop. The doctor prescribed hormonal medications for me after examination . Because she was feeling very sick, she paid me an appointment with another doctor. The diagnosis was immediate - surgical myomas and immediate referral for surgery . How is it possible that Mr. Dr. . Barcikowski did not recognize during two visits of uterine myomas? I can't answer this question, but after the surgery I will explain it so that other patients do not have to do something similar."
482,"He sent me a request to the hotel to check in before noon. 00 . Fate wanted that they got 'em 15 minutes before 14. 00 . Both rooms were not ready yet. The first room got 'em after half an hour, the next 14. 30 . The hotel had my email and phone number, but nobody advised me of the delay. The lady at the reception desk was the only nice person who saved the situation with coffee in the cafe, didn't use em, didn't drink coffee. The menu at the restaurant looked interesting, but we were not allowed to check it. When we took our seats, it took a lot of time before the waitress was able to give us the menu and informed us that we had to wait for 40 minutes for a meal, although the room was not filled. She offered nothing to drink! Another 10 minutes no one accepted the order, so we resigned. Four-star hotel or museum? I felt like a visitor and all the employees are from the security, just looking at the intruders. After Euro 2012 and the visit of the Italian national team probably got a little out of the way. Briefly: all the staff are not doing well, either they are not trained, or there are not enough of them and where are the managers who manage the place. One thing you're not the other way around for guests. My stay was unsuccessful, I didn't use em the spa and the pool because I was disgusted with the whole situation. The advantages: close to the salt mine, a pleasant place."
483,"I don't know what kind of doctor Dr. Więcek is. Judging by the comments, probably good. I wasn't a patient of mine. I was in the office only once at a prenatal examination, where it turned out that my child has a high neck translucency. She had an impression that you are disturbing the office, the whole examination said something to each other under the nose and cmokal nervously because the child did not want to cooperate. At the end he presented me with situations as if the child must be sick for sure. He did not give me any hope that maybe it will be good that there are chances that the child will be born healthy and yet she heard that ""how can I remove something up to 20 weeks"" - a poor consolation for a 30 year old woman who has just collapsed the whole world. She came out of the office so distraught that she did not know what to do with herself. I know that the doctor is not from patting on the back and soaping the eyes but maybe it's worth working on how to convey bad news. I don't know what it came from. Maybe it wasn't because I wasn't your patient, or maybe I just had a worse day. The only plus is that she got me a referral for a consultation to another facility where another Dr. Dr. Dr. Yes, he did confirm that it could be bad but he also gave up hope that the neck's translucency still doesn't prove anything that even Papp's tests that came out tragically do not exaggerate anything. To Dr. Więcka I made an appointment for the tests because of the good opinions and recommendation by my gynaecologist, unfortunately I was disappointed with the visit: ( . The baby was born healthy."
484,"The future four-storey Hampton has reached a closed shell, has all the windows and is now being ""wrapped"" with insulating cladding. At this stage of work, the hotel, although it is part of the Hilton Worldwide family, which is associated with the Hilton Hotel's high-end products, is no different from the four-storey blocks of flats between which it is located. This will probably change once the façade panels are installed, although even then the hotel will be poorly visible from Żwirki i Wigury Street. It will be a bit better exposed from the side of the airport, which is adjacent to the plot with the hotel. The Hampton by Hilton Warsaw Airport, which belongs to the economic segment, will offer 116 double rooms, 24-hour Snack Bar, breakfast, work and meeting area with Internet access, as well as a conference room and fitness club."
485,"Definitely the worst four-star hotel she's ever been in. The room and bathroom look like they were decorated 30 years ago. The carpet in the room is worn, the bed linen is stained (fortunately the pillowcases are clean and the bed is comfortable), the joints in the bathroom are dirty with old age, demanding renovation. There was no phone and a floor lamp in the room. The receptionist during the check-in did not honor us even with a shadow of a smile and all the time she was sipping candy (seriously . . . ) . Against the backdrop of all this, the gentleman who took care of the pool and the sauna, smiling and helpful, was a wonderful person."
486,"Course : English B 1 / E Evaluation : mediocre / acceptable [ / b ] Total hopelessness . . . . .grandmother is absolutely unsuitable for teaching, she often has problems with some phrases herself, she can't teach. Because of this, all the reading I have had the opportunity to do with her I think I've lost. . . .boring and in addition to that, vole not developing. . . .preparation for the exam is virtually zero. ."
487,"The lectures are incomprehensible, it's all shown on slides, you won't understand anything from the lecture, you have to live on your own, but Dr. Panek has a very nice mood and you can make fun of him and get along with him, the circles are simple, you learn and pass, he is not a demanding man, one colloquium at the end of the semester, but sometimes you can talk to him."
488,"The hotel is pretty but has a child-friendly attitude. There is a regime, denunciation and mental terror for taking sandwiches and eggs for children to go to the beaches. At dinner the children could not have their little juices and had to drink outside the dining room like animals. The staff can't give the reason for the refusal and there are no regulations where it is written. The hotel manager and resident of Ithaca use blackmail about check-out and do not care about the customer . Water for dinner 5 € . The waiter serves fruit from the floor . No seafood, modest food for a hotel of this class. Guests mainly from Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia."
489,"The first impression after entering the hotel is as positive as possible. Spacious lobby, nice and professional service, we could easily enter the room earlier than the scheduled hotel day. Room neat, tiny, for a family of three a little bit tight (but you can book beforehand a larger family), two restaurants, in the building And the children have a separate place to play (interesting solution), good food (every day a different culinary theme), you just have to watch your plate, because the waiters quickly take away the tableware, even if we have not yet eaten: ) we didn't like it personally, always crowded and loud. A lot of animation for parents and children, but for the older ones, for toddlers aged 3 years is worse. The swimming pool area and the playroom are all right. Unfortunately, the hotel is close to the road leading to Wladyslawowo and there is no day without much car traffic. There is still noise, someone who wanted to take a break from the exhaust fumes and the hustle and bustle of the city has no chance of it. Access to the beach through the forest, about 100 meters, close. The second thing is to go down the stairs. Tiresome for pregnant women and strollers."
490,"Evaluation : It's okay : ] Mr. Skoczylas is quite a specific lecturer: ) Generally a very nice man with it, exercises, as for me, super conducted, stress-free. The task at colloquia quite difficult at times. Despite the fact that I was a little bit out of tune for the first semester, I was happy to choose him and the second. P . S . don't believe in his stories with stretching as I missed a point, for presence, etc. because it's bullshit :) I missed 0.5 point to pass the exercises and anyway I had to go to the exam ."
491,"The vast majority of independent hotels in Poland do not carry out any active activities aimed at permanent presence in the media. The presence is not advertising, but in editorial materials published in the press, Internet media, radio or television. This is to the undoubted detriment of these facilities, because all media relations activities are not only the cheapest way to build an image, but may also have an impact on sales. There are two main reasons for this state of affairs: - ignorance of the importance of public relations and its role in the marketing communication of the facility, - lack of resources, which translates into a lack of appropriate employees. Many hotels, especially smaller, independent ones, cannot afford to employ either agencies or employees dealing exclusively with public relations. Meanwhile, in order to carry out an effective action - or even ""as such"", which is always better than none at all - an accommodation facility does not have to accept a full-time PR or hire it on commission."
492,"I've been under Dr. Móla's care for several years. He always listens to me carefully, examines me thoroughly, advises me when I need to heal - effectively! He always discusses the problem in detail, presents all the most modern methods of treatment and their alternatives, informs about their costs, presents the whole treatment plan, adjusts appointments. When I sit in his office in an armchair, he can ensure peace, safety and trust thanks to the fact that he always says what he is doing (painlessly, because he always asks if the anaesthetic works). You can feel that he is a doctor by vocation! I recommend !"
493,"Hotel with a very high standard. Buffet-style food will satisfy the most demanding guests. Friendly place for families with children - there are lifts or driveways everywhere. On the beach you can ride a pram because there are special footbridges. Professional service . The hotel's standard is 5 stars in international standard. The side of Rhodes where the hotel is located is not windy. There are several swimming pools available, including a heated one for small children. For active people, a gym and a spa. The hotel has a shop where you can buy groceries and hygiene is a great convenience as the nearest shop is 40km away. In the hotel you can rent a car. A cool option are rooms with their own swimming pool. The food we had is Full Board. Drinks are extra paid and you have to count on them about 100 euros for 7 days for two people. We recommend ."
494,"The standard of the hotel is not adequate to the price, the rooms need to be renovated, dirty carpets, scratched furniture and a lamb on the walls is probably not the standard of a 4-star hotel? Service at the reception without smile and professionalism. Very poorly - I strongly advise against"
495,"She was at the doctor's with her daughter, 7 years old with another doctor after the EEG and the professor said that there was nothing like that. He was kind, polite and explained everything with a good attitude towards the child. Now I read these opinions here and I do not know what to think. For me, however, it's a plus."
497,"She decided to buy this paint because she had a problem with getting emulsion paint in the shop, which is said to be best suited for old buildings. Dekorala paint is a latex paint, easy to maintain (any dirt can be wiped off without affecting the paint film). This paint has a dense consistency, which could be felt already during painting (the paint thickens and dries quickly - even in a few hours). I would have been happy with it if it hadn't been for the fact that the colour that m chose had nothing to do with honey. The color she got was orange. I recommend this paint, however, after a prior, careful examination of the color (I advise not to suggest colours on the package)."
498,"The modernization of Novotel Gdańsk Marina will include renovation of public areas: lobby, reception and bar. ""The lobby and reception, which are the hallmark of the whole hotel, have been designed with the use of furniture with modern shapes and intensive colours. The decor will refer to the seaside character of the object - joyful colours and lighting will give a more relaxing tone to this space"". ...says Edgar Kaszubski, an architect from Studio Virgo. The large lobby area is optimally designed, the colours used and the placement of the library in the hotel lobby will surely encourage guests to stay here and strengthen the interaction between people relaxing in the hotel."
499,"How do they know about this record ? From the regulations published by their national ministries of foreign affairs in chapters devoted to travel, specifically to Poland. Does the hotel have to accept these guests despite their refusal to show their identity document? ""No. For in a hotel facility we have the right to apply hotel regulations - an internal document that regulates, among other things, the order and organization of the hotel. Polish law stipulates that in collective accommodation facilities the regulations have the power of the established law, unless, of course, they are contrary to higher ranked documents: the Constitution, other laws and regulations. . If the regulations of the hotel facility include the following clause: ""upon check-in, a guest of the ABC Hotel is obliged to show the employee at the reception desk a document with a photo confirming his/her identity. In case of refusal to show the document in a way that enables the check-in, the hotel employee is obliged to refuse to give the key to the room"". then a foreigner, just like a Pole, has two choices."
500,"As if the course B 1 and the material you are working on is in B 1 , B 1 E and you are interested in B 2, you pass on the basis of tests, which you probably don't read at all, you are considered to be all-knowing about English and you don't like to see someone having a different opinion (later you take revenge), in general I don't recommend it, there are many other teachers."
501,"A lot of obvious advantages for sure ( all of them mentioned m ) . A nanny is a wonderful device and I can not imagine life without it, especially if you have a storey house, but . . . . . .there are some things that unfortunately, I find very disturbing. The most likely loss of the SIGNAL even with minimal interference. Let's be honest - I don't think there is any place in the modern world where there would be no interference such as phones, WiFi or microwave, except in the wilderness. We live in a two-storey house in the countryside and we are struggling with this problem, so I can imagine what it must look like in the block. The second (from my point of view) most important issue: the alarm about the loss of the signal cannot be switched off, nor can it be turned off, nor turned down, and it is VERY VOICELY VOICELY. Sometimes the receiver is standing in front of my eyes so I can see what is going on, for example thanks to the red alarm screen, and this sound would wake up the deceased. It happened to me that after huffing the baby, I would set up the camera and turn on the receiver to check if everything was visible, and here the receiver did not find the signal and screamed. So the big minus for that. And of course for such a price not to have two-way audio communication is ridiculous."
502,"The doctor makes a very good impression and likes to share his knowledge with the other man, he is patient and attentive, he will certainly not hurt anyone. The only downside is the price list in Expert Dental, but I suspect that this is due to the location of the office (a place practically in the city centre) and the high standard. I personally can't afford to pay more frequent visits, but the person who lands at Dr. Dental. Sławecki will pay a high price for equally high quality service. I recommend ."
503,"Unfortunately, after a year, the heads fall. I also have 4 units and only one is working properly. The heads don't open in a given time - only if they want to, or not at all (he writes about the mode without an intelligent forecast) if they want to work, they completely do not pay attention to the current temperature in the room. Eventually, I tried to force the heads to fully close or open, introducing a comfortable temperature of 28 and lowering to 6 - but it does not help either, - the valve or vibrate. Weird situations - lack of circulation in what and boiling water on the stove - thank God nothing happened. Attention the product may be dangerous."
504,"there were nasty stains on the sofa in the hotel room and the bathroom was falling apart. officially, they complained to me but they did nothing about it. Besides, the staff were not interested in the guests and seemed to lack professionalism in their profession. I will never go back there again."
505,"I agree with my predecessors. Dr. Kornel is a very original character. He introduces humanism to the teaching of mathematics and tries to teach the theoretical basis in an extremely interesting way. He tries to explain to everyone. . . . .and how he makes examples is often very cosmic. . . . .but it shows that mathematics is not automatics, that you have to think! But when it comes to science. . . .there's a lot you can't learn with Cornel. At least it's not like you can count everything and so on. I wouldn't recommend it for the more ambitious ones, but in fact, if somebody is walking on the most difficult line of resistance, I recommend it! As a colleague has already mentioned, Korni seems twisted and living in a strange world, but the fact that someone pulled down at once will detect! Once upon a time also for an exercise. We added 2 people to the list, Kornel took the list, he didn't even look at the number of people. . . ...and suddenly he burned out as if nothing had happened. . . """
506,"I was only on a body composition analysis, but it was to be with a discussion of your dietitian. One, that the equipment would have almost failed and the examination would not have taken place at all, two - your dietitian did not actually discuss the result by herself but answered my (perhaps clumsy) questions, in addition with considerable impatience (or at least that was my feeling). I had a feeling that I just wanted to go out and finish my work, which was confirmed by the fact that right after I crossed the threshold, she locked the door behind me. . . It was somehow just not nice. I don't recommend it."
507,"A great LEKEARSHOUSE - A very concrete person, professional in full, able to explain everything in a very matter-of-fact way, has a great knowledge. After the visit, which lasted not 15 minutes, but 2 hours after hours, the doctor's office, she came out I was uplifted, which is extremely important to me, but also with the medication set and the chance to recover. She thought that there are no more such wonderful, patient and warm doctors - but it turned out otherwise. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. She really had me and I am very lucky that she got me to Monika Łukaszewicz."
508,"Unfortunately I don't trust Dr. Drozd, my treatment started with a high dose of the drug after which my thyroid was sore and she had the feeling that it was growing. but still she had to take it according to the doctor. Another endocrinologist immediately found out that with such a dose, my thyroid will grow and I will fall into great hypothyroidism with a little overactivity. According to your doctor, it may be better to treat hypothyroidism than hyperthyroidism, but the size of my thyroid is also important for me. I advise you to be careful with the doctor's recommendations and it is best to consult them with another endocrinologist."
509,"The Provincial Hotelik, nothing to add to the fact that they are hunting a guest from the very entrance to the exit, they caught us burning a cigarette in the room - searching the room during our exit including looking for cigarettes - taking photos of the garbage and the window sill - the effect - 500zł penalty from the Director - Good anti advertising - I do NOT recommend! ! !"
510,"The little room. Only for one person. Two can't pass each other. No air conditioning. No openable windows . For the third towel they charge 5zł. No toilet brush, no glasses, no TV very poor in the channel and still the picture sticks. Generally, I would not recommend that you alone and for one night."
511,"The hotel has a water park, which was popular with children. This place as a whole is very popular with families with children. Expect crowds on summer weekends because the water park is not only available for hotel guests. There are no outdoor attractions provided by the hotel. They would like us to go on a trip, on a longer boat trip or something like that, but all that could be provided by the reception was leaflets from small boats. The children's menu at the Hotel Restaurant ""Green"" was disappointing. The children's pizzas were thick and with a small number of topings, ice cream we arrived with the wrong kinds of ice cream from the café. The adult menu was great, but the children were disappointed."
512,"I went to see the doctor with a child in whom all the doctors visited saw the features of a genetic syndrome (from the ophthalmologist to the neurologist). After a superficial examination of the son, your geneticist found that he was not a genetic patient and she did not see the indications for examination. She wrote that the child only needs to be rehabilitated and everything will be ok. Good thing I didn't believe it and yet I did the tests. . . It turned out that the little one has a genetic defect and what is more (and more importantly) administration of a drug can cause the little one to develop much better and have a chance to live a much better life (without the drugs it is not enough that he would be physically affected and he has a damaged gene responsible for dopamine synthesis - the neurotransmitter). I would like to add that I was on a private visit and I also wanted to do the examination with my own money - the doctor simply did not come to examine the child: ("
513,"I am the doctor and mother of a boy with a chronic illness, whom the professor saved his life, and then repeatedly gave valuable advice on treatment while others spread their hands. His knowledge and willingness to help are used by sick children from all over Poland, which can be seen every week in the Admissions Chamber of the University Children's Hospital. I would like to tell you that you are concerned about your child's behaviour after the administration of the medicine and that many of the medicines may be followed by adverse reactions, which are reported by the pharmaceutical companies on the leaflets attached to the medicine and are not responsible for these reactions. After many years of practice, I know that many studies mean unnecessary patient exposure, e.g. to nosocomial infections, or would you like to expose your tiny child? The professor has cured thousands of children and he knows exactly when and what tests should be performed. I do not agree with your opinion about the professor, although of course I sympathize with you because of the child's illness, I wish you and your loved ones health and prosperity."
514,"I had a little dilemma. . . this dilemma was the choice between Xperia Z1 Sgs4 and HTC ONE. out of human curiosity, he drove 'em to the store just to feel each of them in his hand. To Sgs4 I was most attracted to it, but what seemed to be cool. It was an illusion! Generally, I thought em that the housing ( I had sgs3 ) would be less plastic fantastic ! From its predecessor. It turned out differently. . . But in general I have nothing bigger to blame him. The time has come for... . . . . . . .super waterproof Z-weaving. And apart from this particular water resistance, nothing more positive I can't name. When I compared em screen colors with sgs4 and Htc ONE . . . He thought em was an illusion. . . . . And finally it's time for My FAVORITE or HTC ONE , a housing with ALUMINIUM and all that! ! ! ! ! very nice design which I cannot say about sgs4 . . . In fact, the parameters of sgs4 and HTC ONE are very similar. The phones outperform each other in the parameters. . . So the only thing to pay attention to between these two is that the Htc has a 0.2 smaller illuminator. But that's a plus because it has the same resolution. So in conclusion, I bought 'em HTC One and I'm VERY satisfied. PS SGS4 sometimes lagged behind, in Htc Onew haven't got 'em yet."
515,"We went to visit the town of Mozart. They chose a hotel near the center. It is easy to get to the city center also not far away, 10 minutes on foot and you can see many interesting places. The hotel is neat, clean and pleasant. The only downside is late accommodation. Officially it is only from 3 in the afternoon. But you can pay for the late listing. The rooms are typical of Mercura, a curiosity is the carpet with a Mozart score. Minibar full . Breakfast is abundant. And good wines from Austria are on offer at the bar. Generally I recommend . Well, maybe one receptionist not too communicative. . ."
517,"Hello I had a visit on April 16th at 4 p.m. It seemed like the last client. I felt that everything was being done in a hurry and my name was Lenczewska and probably a wrong address because I heard when The doctor wrote it down from the proof, she said Bohaterow Warszawy and my address of Bohaterow but Monte Cassino 2 / 1, so there are no my results from the cytology. I do not agree to visit again for lack of concentration and haste, and no results of course I greet you"
518,"The doctor was very rude to me. Maybe she just hit me on her bad day. She was treated quite unpleasantly, I was yelled at, but luckily at least I was examined. Moreover, paraphrasing the patient's words, the doctor tends to twist what is said to her, so I don't even know if what is written on the card is true. From my perspective, I do not recommend it."
519,"He stopped me here when I arrived in Prague and is not very good. . . It is located near the Nový Smíchov shopping centre, which is a great convenience, but when we entered our room, it was not very pleasant. . . There were various stains on the walls and bedding. . . That's why he slept 'em rolled up in a ball. . . . . It was very dirty, so I don't recommend this place."
520,"From the outside it looks very average , old paving slabs around also make a bad impression . However, I think it will soon be replaced, probably even already renovate something. The room that got m was freshly renovated and generally nice and cosy furnished. Well, that didn't read my last reviews, I wonder if you were writing about the same building as me. The balcony is not in top condition, but it's just a balcony. Bathroom's tiny but clean. It's not a hotel, but room number 8 is not different from good hotels, the bathroom unfortunately yes. With a prepayment of the whole amount for the stay got me an extra discount and free parking."
521,"Hello! I am pregnant, led by Dr. Mazur and - so far - I am very pleased. At every ultrasound examination my husband is with me, Dr. Mazur explains everything, and I really want to know a lot: ) ) He explains in detail and no questions surprise him, no ignoring. Yes, he's waiting for an appointment (in the waiting room), but it doesn't seem to be the worst thing about him as a doctor (it's probably a matter of organization, I don't know:), the patients also sometimes don't listen to the advice about the time of arrival and they do it ""in their own way""). Every patient (regardless of age and beauty) is in the office at least 20 minutes, pregnant women often stay longer (I usually 30 - 40 minutes). The doctor also gives advice on an appropriate diet, conducts the conversation quite directly, but there is nothing wrong with it. He always asks about a woman's expectations of a visit, even for permission to have an internal examination (last time she was with her husband, so apart from me, also his asked if he could examine me). I just focus on seeing Dr. Mazur as a doctor with whom you can REALLY talk to and who reads the ultrasound well. I do not judge or record whether he looked at me one way or another and what it could mean! ! ! . He has to do his job and while he does it I have no objections! ! ! I would also like to add that the doctor does not search for anomalies in the fetus, he does not invent illnesses which he does not have and he does not make frequent visits. So far, nothing bad is going on with me, although it is the second pregnancy and the first child was barely saved (birth), so one could worry. I start every visit with a short reminder of the history of the dissolution of the pregnancy and later stays in the hospital - at his explicit request. I sympathize with the ladies who were forced to give such bad opinions, but I think that it is all a matter of perception and bad coincidence. BUT I RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR! ! !"
522,"The third visit to Wiechlice assured me of its greatest advantage: the combination of quality and comfort with no blowing up. This unique climate is due to the wonderful, warm owners and friendly staff. What is striking here is also the attention to detail. Nowhere, except in Wiechlice, has I encountered sterilization of baby seats. What is important to me is that the atmosphere of the place allows parents and children to feel comfortable. There is a playground and a lot of space for the little ones. They don't have to sit at the table to watch out. Wonderful!"
523,"A Daimonds toothbrush, but it fits other models (I use the Healthy White toothbrush) and there is no problem with matching the Daimonds toothbrush. I get the impression that they are brighter, not yellowing, plus you can use pastes and lotions that choose and then the results are even better. They are very good for wearing braces. There is no comparison with a regular toothbrush if someone has a problem with the fast build-up of tartar and deposits, as is the case with me. I recommend it very much."
524,"I recommend, I've been going to her for 10 years now - I'm very happy, she was carrying out my pregnancy a few years ago - she ordered all the necessary tests, ultrasound - she measured the date of birth perfectly. After the birth she had problems and the doctor helped me a lot. Last winter she helped me again for which I thank her. I mention that earlier she went to Dr. Baja and unfortunately to Flis - brrrrrr."
525,"A similar problem is with zoonotic valves, mostly from pigs. There, immunogenicity must be masked even more strongly. Aggressive chemicals make the tissue dead, so there can be no repair processes in it. Such a valve also undergoes liming after some time, and the younger the body, the faster the undesirable changes occur. If we implant such a valve to a child, it has to be replaced after about 10 years, sometimes even in a shorter period. Mechanical valves are very durable, but they damage platelets, red blood cells and so on. The patient who has been given such a valve has to take anticoagulants at all times. Contraindications for mechanical valve implantation include pregnancy, because during childbirth, taking such drugs could cause bleeding and other far-reaching complications."
526,"A terrible hotel! Dirt, stench and poverty. During the stay there was a renovation, which we were not informed about during the reservation. I don't know where the 4 stars come from if the sauna and fitness doesn't work and the breakfast buffet is modest to say the least. What's more, breakfast can be eaten in the company of construction workers."
527,"A place located near Ostróda on Lake Wielki Szeląg. Very spacious and modern rooms with Internet access. Wonderful atmosphere thanks to a nice owner and their helpers (dog, cats). The mornings started very tasty, because the breakfast served is delicious thanks to the product from their farm. As far as the rest of the meals are concerned, Mrs. Maja and Mr. Marcin offer high quality kitchens at a reasonable price. The beach is from agritourism ok . 100 m . The swimming pool is very well prepared, with platforms and floating equipment rental. We will be very happy to repeat our stay here. I recommend it!"
528,"The hotel is located in the old part of the city, on the square, which is one of the most popular places for evening meetings, a few seconds from La Rambla and close to the port. The rooms are clean and well-kept with free access to WIFI. Tasty breakfasts. Location and offer of the hotel at a price - a revelation. A great starting point for exploring Barcelona. I sincerely recommend !"
529,"You all praise this LEADER, and the woman has trouble recognizing bronchitis, claiming it's nothing. Coughing for 2 weeks. After 3 days with another DOCTOR. How long have you been coughing, more than 2 weeks, then why are you coming now? I was at Mrs. Walkowska's house and she said that nothing was wrong with me. The DOCTOR's eyes did not fall out of orbit. Slow down for 2 weeks and the strongest antibiotics. I do NOT recommend it, unless somebody wants to be hospitalized because of reluctance to work in the clinic. Maybe in private he listens better, but in the clinic it does grace at least."
530,"The hotel is well located, because in the center. It has its pros and cons. The view from my room is a tragedy! Old, plaster-tearened tenements. That's a shame. And the room is very cold, the radiator is summer all night long! No one from the staff has made up for it."
531,"In mid-October, we came with our wife and son to the Young Man's Regatta. Due to the fact that they stayed overnight we took with us a dog of the breed Jack Russell , (to explain the dog size of a cat and very friendly) . I would like to mention that we came in a larger group and rented us a few rooms, which is rather important for this industry in the low season. Already after crossing the threshold of the hotel, we heard the categorical ""but with this PSEM it must go out! ! ! Any requests or conversations ended up with what in the opinion of the Lord with a bicycle "" NO because NO ! "" Not much of it, the sarcastic receptionist said that in the whole of Mrągowo we will not find a place with a dog. . . Unfortunately, this is not the end of rudeness on the part of the owners. Friends suggested that m left his luggage and walked to the hotel next door for which some buc (I presume the owner) sitting in the hall said that under no circumstances can I leave my luggage - I have to take it and leave. . . . .which we were most happy to do. We were very welcome at the ANEK Hotel for better money and there was no problem with the dog. The rest of our group that stayed at the hotel Huszcza was also dissatisfied and disgusted especially with the behavior of the shoe and poor quality of the hotel kitchen. Our leg will not stand there anymore. . . It's a waste of money. . ."
532,"Seaside apartment projects are being developed in Kołobrzeg, Władysławowo or Świnoujście. Holiday apartments are also offered in the most prestigious development projects in Tri-City, located directly along the coast. There is a tendency to create aparthotel investments where residential and hotel parts are combined. The residents are offered a swimming pool, fitness and spa. The second location of apartment investments is the southern part of Poland - the mountains."
533,"Completely inadequate with what the network offers in other large cities. . after Wroclaw expected something more and the price does not differ from that in other novotels. To such an extent I am disappointed with the standard that my three-day planned stay is shortened to two: / already at the beginning pointed out to me that there is a clear lack of appropriate staff here. During the check-in, I witnessed another guest complaining about the cleanliness of his room. . My room was clean, but this situation at the beginning of my stay was a bit discouraging. The staff at the reception desk is very kind and helpful. A very nice idea are the maps of Wroclaw, which could be taken from the reception desk and move around the city freely. In the bar on the ground floor to serve only one person who could not cope with the number of orders. . and no wonder: / poorly, not recommended, not worth the price."
534,"She got me to this doctor with a sore and terrible shooting knee. The doctor was blowing my leg right and left - it was shooting and clattering terribly - and he said it was normal! ! After two days of pain, I went to another doctor, who as soon as he touched the knee, he immediately found that the kneecap is moving and there is lateralization of the kneecap and immediately performed ultrasound and X-ray, which Mr. Mieczkowski did not even order me. Besides that, he was terribly dry and unsympathetic! !"
535,"I see that Dr. Dziewońska ""likes"" angina. For now the medicines prescribed by the doctor are working, we haven't been to any doctor yet to confirm the diagnosis, although after the opinions read here, we may go. In spite of the private visit, it is unpleasant and unpleasant. You seem to be in hearing of it, you don't react to your parent's suggestions - e.g. that maybe instead of suppositories, antipyretic syrup - says your own, collects the money and goes out. She may have the experience and practice, but she doesn't approach the little patient or the parent for a penny. I advise against it."
536,"the atmosphere in the hotel would say home. When you enter the reception, the ladies welcome a nice good morning until you want to continue entering and not as it happens that the girls sit at the reception and neither me nor be. And here it's completely different. The whole stay also went well. I'll come again sometime : )"

Similarly, synthesized pro-healthy fats are contained, for example, in baby food, in pro-healthy preparations, in fat for athletes. Researchers are looking for different enzymes. Dr hab . Adamczak was interested in lipases because they are unique. ""For enzymes to work, there must be water in the environment and lipases also work when there is very little water. Their properties in these almost anhydrous conditions are completely changed, e.g. they can catalyze (accelerate) the synthesis of biodiesel from vegetable oil or synthesize protein"" - justifies his scientific passion of a biotechnologist in an interview with Małgorzata Hołubowska from ""University News"" UWM."
539,"As a gift from our children we received a few days' stay in this hotel. We were there in March. The service is fantastic, the cleanliness of the rooms is exemplary, the room equipment and bathrooms are on a high level almost all new. From the balcony of the room stretched the view on maybe. The meals served during our stay were tasty, varied and in appropriate quantities. The hotel swimming pool with hot and clean water, tastefully decorated. Spa without any problems. We would be happy to come back here."
540,"I also advise against it. For a year I have been struggling unnecessarily with problems that the doctor wanted to remove with some archaic methods. She is completely unfamiliar with the new methods of treatment, she forgets to order a test and for 100 zloty I would like to sit in a comfortable chair. Now I have a world-class gynecologist who knows what to do and takes less. And you don't wait in line. I hated the fact that despite an hour's appointment you always have to wait at least 45 minutes more. . ."
541,"The development of the holiday apartment market has been clearly stopped in recent years. The specificity of this segment of the real estate market is that the main product does not meet the basic housing needs, and the demand for this product is to a large extent unstable and dependent on temporary fashion and positive PR of such a form of investment. It is impossible to resist the impression that at the peak of this segment's popularity in Poland (2007 and the first half of 2008), an additional stimulus to market development was strictly speculative demand, i.e. investors who saw the purchase of an apartment (sometimes a package of apartments) in a holiday resort as a very favourable capital investment which will bring large profits in the near future, Emmerson analysts write. The economic situation was particularly stimulated by tempting investment simulations presented by developers based on optimistic assumptions of constant growth: - the value of the property, - the occupancy rate of the apartment and - the rates of renting the apartment by tourists, which resulted in a false belief among buyers that this investment cannot be lost. The crisis on the market verified this thesis, reminding that in case of a downturn on the real estate market, the holiday apartment sector loses its value much faster than the market of traditional apartments. Currently, the propensity for such investments is much lower than three to four years ago."
542,"She bought me a product in zooplus, unfortunately apparently they have some kind of agreement with the Czech Republic because she gave me there a negative evaluation of several of the company's products and none of them were published (a few months ago, my other evaluations were published). Going back to the product itself. The food is very popular with cats but since a few years ago the RC company has been bought out by a whiskas company and the composition of the food is terribly poor quality. It is whiskas in a different package. It does not contain any meat at all, and the enigmatically named animal proteins, which are usually obtained e.g. from feathers, are extremely low quality proteins. What's even worse is that it is full of cereals and plant products (i.e. all waste). Cats are carnivores and this is what they should be fed. Why do cats like to eat it? Because it is full of chemical additives that improve the taste so that cats will touch it at all. It contains preservatives that are responsible for causing cancer. Remember that not everything that tastes healthy (we also eat chips. . . . ) . I would like to conclude by saying that my kitten has developed a strong allergy on this food (to cereals) and because of this (or maybe it is because of this that she found out what kind of junk food RC produces)."
543,"It is worrying, according to the organizers, because mercury - the second most toxic element on Earth after plutonium - is not biodegradable and has a very harmful effect on our health and environment. It is stored in living organisms, including humans, and interferes with many vital biochemical processes. When a thermometer or a fluorescent lamp breaks down, fumes containing mercury particles can quickly lead to poisoning. Therefore, the first thing to do is to ventilate the room where the breakage occurred and close the door so that nobody enters the room and spreads the residual mercury throughout the apartment. The glass remains should be collected in rubber gloves, then the floor should be wiped with disposable damp paper towels, and all this should be placed in a sealed plastic bag (including gloves). Then you have to wash your hands thoroughly and return the bag to the fluorescent lamp collection point."

546,"Fantastic hotel. Very nice, well organized - many attractions: ski slope, spa, full size sports hall, gym, swimming pool, horses, golf and many more. Very good food, kitchen is suitable for guests' needs. A large playroom for children. Several bars and a disco. Clean rooms, quite large. I personally recommend that you choose a residence - it is quieter than a hotel, and the underground passage does not force you to walk outside to reach the other building."
547,"I don't know how to refer to the person of Mr. Prof . at first I was very happy that he took care of me, although in total he would not call me that. Paying 500 zloty for the visit, the doctor is expected to do more than just referral to the hospital. It's really not a little money. She was operated on at Haller's - 2 times and when she was supposed to have 3 surgeries she suddenly heard me two days before the surgery that I lacked benefits. I can no longer remember with 2 (cosmetic) surgeries did not help me, and the abscess was still growing. It wasn't the worst, just the professor's memory. He completely forgot that he supposedly operated on me and that I was at his place on private visits. The professor thought it was to be my first operation. I know that he is a good doctor, he helped many people. I don't know, maybe I just had bad luck."

549,"When the gynaecologist's post in the clinic no. 10 was liquidated, my card was moved to Daleka Street, where Dr. Ossowska is taking me. I am already at 40 hundred and not one doctor of this specialization visited me. On the first visit she turned out to be not very polite, disrespectful to the patient and generally unpleasant. The most important thing is that she treated me with contraceptives, while she already had symptoms of menopause. She changed my doctor to Dr. Chamerski, and immediately got a referral for specific and necessary tests, and my ailments were minimized. I do not recommend Mrs. Ossowska to anyone! I will add that she thinks that a woman gynaecologist will understand the other woman better, but she was very disappointed in me. Bożena"

551,"This hotel is a mockery of a client. The hotel only looks nice in the pictures and from afar. The photos were taken a long time ago when this hotel was created and not updated until now. All you have to do is go inside and the charm splashes. The ubiquitous mess, the reception staff acting as if they didn't know what they were doing there, the cold water and the lack of heating in the rooms are just some of the things that have weakened me. The staff at the reception desk has no idea where the rooms are, so we visited the whole hotel looking for a room at the other end of the building. The corridors are dark, the wallpaper was falling off the walls and the carpet was dirty as if someone puked on it or puked on it. The rooms are not hot and it is cold. The carpet is dirty and stained. The air-conditioning system was not working and after the complaint at the reception desk we were informed that it would only be warm after 6:00 pm and in fact nothing was heating and it was cold in the rooms throughout the stay. Wallpaper in the rooms fell off and were crookedly glued. The electrical installation on top of that fear of touching anything. The equipment was old, the TV set probably 10 inches - cathode ray tube which received maybe with 2 stations on the cross. The seats wiped out, and in the middle under the seat only fungus and mould. When the fridge was connected to the power supply it started to make more noise than the petrol mower. The fridge made a lot of noise and didn't cool anything ... after informing the Lord at the reception we received information that we had to say at the reservation that we wanted to have a fridge in the room. Because if they don't, they change working with not working fridges to such rooms where someone wanted it to be there ... These are the words of the receptionist! When he heard 'em, he didn't know what to tell 'em. It seems that you have to ask for everything when booking even hot water? ! No... No kettle, no glasses and cutlery in the room, not to mention that this is the standard of room equipment. No lock in the door from the bathroom, no cold water in the taps, so washing was not possible. The only source of heat is a radiator in the bathroom on the electricity, but it did not give too much because there was still moisture. The bathtub was made of poor quality plastic, which under the weight of the water poured in, it was crackling and shooting. The floor on the balconies as if it had just been poured out, until they wondered if it was still fresh concrete ... The balcony window had to be opened skillfully because if it wasn't, the whole wing fell out. I can't get attached to the beds because they were very comfortable and solid. I can't stick to the beds because they were very comfortable and solid. On a bowling alley with 3 tracks only 2 operate. Of which one that we had the pleasure to have was missing. First of all there wasn't one bowling alley, so you couldn't beat all the bowling alley because the computer claimed that the one that is not there is still there and that's it. And we could have witnessed levitating bowling pins hanging from 5 cm above the ground by the machine. The billiard tables were old and destroyed and had a broken material ... For several billiard sets only one was complete and had all the tickets. The ping-pong table was destroyed and on one side as if it had been bitten. It was the equipment that was better not to touch or it would fall apart. The table was not leveled properly, so one person was still flying the ball into the goal even if he didn't do anything, but the other person had to put a lot of pressure to score a point. The ride in the elevator resembled the ride we saw in the ""Hospital of Periphery"". and on the last day the elevator refused to obey. I can't stick to the food because it was good and much. Only the staff don't know why they waited until the last crumble is eaten, before when they see that something is ending it is already going to go for food to put on the Swedish table? And there was a similar situation during a bonfire with sausages. There had to be no plates, ketchup and mustard for someone to bring and add."
552,"""What is extremely important, the effects of taking these new substances are unpredictable,"" added Dr. Agata Błażewicz from the National Medicines Institute. ""These substances have not been pharmacologically tested so far, they do not have full toxicological documentation, we do not know too much about them. Unfortunately, those who take them are actually guinea pigs,"" she stressed. The National Medicines Institute (NIL) has been analysing the content of afterburner substances for 10 years now (since they appeared in Poland). As Dr. Błażewicz explained, on the basis of the data collected by the NIL, ""it can be seen that the composition of these samples changes from year to year; when older substances are banned, their new synthetic derivatives appear"" ."
553,"According to the Wroclaw University, within the framework of the scientific project, Dr. Cieślik-Boczula will conduct research that allows to determine the type of changes occurring in lipid membranes in the presence of specific compounds. These are compounds with a very strong ""chemosensitive"" effect. which means that it restores the sensitivity of e.g. bacteria and protozoa to drugs. These compounds reduce the resistance of cancer cells to drugs, thus increasing or even conditioning the effectiveness of chemotherapy. ""Explaining the membrane-dependent mechanism of chemoprevention is one of the most important challenges facing basic research in 21st century medicine and pharmacy. The received conclusions and observations will constitute a large and significant step in the search for new, i.e. better candidates for anticancer drugs"" - reads the website of the University of Wrocław."
554,"All the beautifully nice, accurate diagnosis, well chosen medications nice approach to the patient so much on the plus, on the minus unfortunately the price for the performed tests, I understand with the knowledge and for the tests on modern equipment you have to pay, I had an ultrasound gastroscopy and a colonoscopy during which I was diagnosed with a polyp to be removed, it could be done with the same approach, it was not done, 700 PLN was removed, I had to register for an additional visit, during which I had to undergo a colonoscopy again, where the polyp was removed time of surgery 10 min cost 800 PLN"
555,"Apart from a good location for those seeking relaxation on the beach, the hotel does not offer anything nice! There is no service, a few people who seem to be working as slaves - well, maybe apart from the reception desk and the pool bar, there is no service at all. . . . . . supposedly we were staying there ""out of season"" - hence the shortage - but the hotel was full. The equipment, billiard tables etc. were all broken! Tables by the swimming pools were dirty, not wiped NEVER after a passing rainfall, there was no place to sit down, we took napkins from the restaurant ourselves and wiped the water standing on chairs. The restaurant was clean and that was it, the food was the same every day! Luckily, a lot of fruit and vegetables so we didn't starve. We had a beautiful room with a view of the beach and the children's pool at the same time, but when she finally asked me at the reception desk on the fourth day of our stay about the cleaning, you were very surprised what we want? We lived with our 5 year old daughter so there was sand on the floor where she slept on the mattress next door, and the toilets and the bathroom were never cleaned, someone just secretly doesn't know when he changed our towels. After my request for cleaning, a broom was put in the room and a mop and bucket. . . . . . . . . . Animators, I don't even want to comment anymore - but I'll write to warn others planning to stay there with the children - they don't do anything all day long, sometimes they hand out a few paintings to the children in the morning and crayons, and sit in their house, and then they dance 3 - 5 songs in the evening and the END! ! ! ! The songs are the same every day for 9 days, at the end we knew them by heart, most of the games and songs in German, one of them barely speaks Spanish. so, I do NOT recommend it ! ! ! A few times they yelled at the children who wanted more fun in the evening than 15 minutes of Mini Disco. The CABINDAY itself has great conditions to relax, it is all in one place, it is a great solution for staying with a child because you can keep an eye on them wherever they are, but with people who work there, it is a terrible despair, we do not recommend and certainly not go there anymore, it was our worst holiday, although the island is beautiful!"

558,"I do not recommend this Hotel as a 5-star service. Although the heating system was broken and the first night we froze, in addition the system was very noisy, we were not offered another room. An electric heater was brought into the room for heating. We felt like we were camping in a mountain hostel."
560,"She bought me this shredder because it was the cheapest one I found. She did not expect it to serve me for years, but at least six months she gave it to me. Unfortunately, but it was much less than she expected. After inserting 4 pieces of paper at a time (max. 5 at a time) the shredder jammed, started to crack, tried to pull out the paper, unclogged it, it turned out that the modes that led the blades broke off. The shredder is to throw away - the plastic cogs are half broken. In addition, it often happened that the shredder was clogged, you had to pull out the paper by hand, it rolled up on rolls. . . If you cannot afford to save money, do not buy this shredder!"

""The device enables identification of functional thermomarkers of breast cancer.

562,"Beautiful beach. The outdoor pool is quite squalid and poor . The reception staff is nice for the Russians and not necessarily for others . Prices of drinks at dinner striped and exorbitant . Monotonous, little seafood and fish, food for breakfast and dinner. Cured meats every day three types of mortadella, paper sausage, poor quality and poor taste. Good breadLack of Greek music, daily evening with music, but no evening with Greek music. The hotel wants to be very European, I had the impression that it was ashamed of its Greekness. It's a pity, because Greekness was once Crete's greatest attribute. . . Not far from the hotel, by the main road, a super tavern with delicious fish, seafood, good wine and a nice and smiling Greek woman."
563,"Unfortunately, but I am not satisfied with the service, I lost only my time and money. She waited for me about 3 weeks for an orthodontic consultation, finally when she came in and paid me to take prints and take pictures she waited for me another 3 weeks to discuss the treatment plan. . and here my dissatisfaction. I had an appointment at 17. 40 where the office closes at 18 . 00 so the Doctor did not foresee more than 20 minutes for my consultation, of which I was admitted at 5 pm . 50, I was presented with a treatment plan in 4 sentences and the visit was finished because the Doctor was in a hurry. I am determined to have the braces and she wanted me to do it efficiently while in this office it is impossible, when she told me that ok I agree on one of two options she asked me which tooth I should tear out 4 or 5 she heard me that I need to make an appointment with the dentist: ) Very professional approach to the customer: ) the next day, when she called me to the dentist to make an appointment to have the teeth to be treated and the teeth to be torn out in order to put on the braces, she told me that she will visit me in 3 weeks! No connection where, after all, if someone has teeth to be treated and pulled out and wants to put on braces, I think it should be in some kind of connection between the dentist and the orthodontist, especially if it happens in the same office: ) but it's nothing. . she took my materials for which she paid m and went to another office for a consultation, it turned out that the models that were made for nothing are unsuitable; (so she had to pay me for another consultation for the same thing. . . I honestly don't recommend that someone has time and steel nerves"
564,"He adds that if there are interesting solutions in the project, you will have to cooperate with ""real"" medicine for safety reasons. Currently, NANOBIOM has established such contacts with research centres, which enable to conduct research on mice and piglets. This pilot work consists of introducing nanoparticles into living organisms and investigating the mechanisms of their absorption and how they spread through the organism with bloodstream. Prof . Godlewski explains that nanopowders circulating in the body can mark cancerous changes. This gives a chance for early detection of the disease and the cancer is categorized as a chronic disease but not fatal - the difference is huge and hopes high."
565,"Without a shadow of a doubt, I can say that the therapy has changed my life. It was a long and difficult journey. My painful past has been overshadowed by my relationships. It was hard for me to trust anyone. However, Małgorzata Kulikowska approached me with great compassion, respect and patience, which allowed me to (finally trust) and open up to the truth about myself. Her knowledge and the questions she asked me allowed me to change the way I look at life and reform my destructive programs step by step. I am very happy that she has found me such a good specialist and warm man. Do not express my gratitude or describe the experience of the therapy with words. I can only warmly recommend Mrs. Małgorzata Kulikowska as a therapist and encourage all those considering the therapy to use her help. The quality of my life under the influence of the therapy has improved incredibly. I am a happy person who is optimistic about the future and was a shaken child who was in chaos."
567,"Before leaving, I read em out the opinions of other people who have spent a few moments in this great place, they were different, complaining about the food, the service etc, it is good to go and verify such or other comments and opinions. We spent the weekend with our wife and two children (7 years and 5 months), it is worth mentioning the full support for the kids (playroom, games room, baby bath in the room, cot, highchair in the restaurant to feed, etc.). The food is very high level, the swimming pool area is uninhabited (literally several people), the rooms are very high level. When it comes to service, perhaps the weakest point is the reception desk and the staff's approach to guests, it was 'em first time and they were counting on any tips for their stay etc, unfortunately, the information was partial and even asked for. The staff at the reception desk is excellent and on a scale from 1 to 10 would give me a 15 / 10 rating. Very nice cleaning ladies, the lady in the kindergarten and the restaurant was all in the best. The big minus for me was the ""jerk"" quality Wi - Fi (often lost the signal and is not available in every place in the hotel as promised) . To sum up, we will mention it up and we will definitely come back, obviously to improve is the service at the reception and approach to each guest individually and with full commitment and improve the quality of the Wi - Fi network in the hotel and such service as the Spa center would wish me and others wherever possible : )"

The booking was made for 1 day in a colossal amount of 274,50 . In fact, these persons were 3 hours in the hotel and the fee was charged for two nights! ! ! Unfortunately, this is the only hotel in the area where we could place employees. While trying to solve this problem we were treated rudely and unprofessionally. The receptionist raised her voice, she did not react to any attempts to explain the situation and shouted. This is the first time I have encountered such treatment of a client and I know that I will warn everyone before booking this hotel. Greetings"
572,"The doctor performed a very professional and painless colonoscopic examination (without general anaesthesia). During the examination, the doctor and the assistant nurse tried to relieve the stress and tension associated with the examination. Thanks to the Doctor, colonoscopy, which she was afraid of, was for me an ordinary diagnostic examination. I recommend to all of you to the Doctor!"
573,"The doctor, who did not interview, did not ask a single question ( !), only read the results of the examination (ultrasound and general urine examination) and intended only to comment on them in the system. Meanwhile, she had a few worrying symptoms, which she did not manage to tell me about, because the doctor apparently considered that he already knew everything and, what is more, he decided that no additional diagnostics was needed (without an interview!) - when she was recommended by her doctor for an in-depth diagnosis of her kidneys, which was indicated by abnormalities in the ultrasound image, and especially the symptoms that she had m . I do not recommend this doctor."
574,"Depends on which group he is dealing with. In our country (physics, WPPT) the tickets were often and quite detailed. We can say that she treated us with special care: wink : . Also when it comes to the reports - you never had to give up on time, you could get rid of her with a few things before the session itself, and even during . It is assessed quite meticulously . She knows things very well."
575,"First impressions very cool . The whole area of the castle and the climate of this place super . Reception and restaurant very nice . But when we entered our room, the spell was gone. The room with communion time. Brown tiles and bathtub . Two old beds and a TV. The hotel has great potential but it needs to be renovated and that right away. The hotel offers gondola swimming. It's a waste of time. It's better to kayak because it gives more excitement. The food as well as the staff super. The location deserves a great advantage. The very center of the city . And if you get to the day when there is a wedding at the castle, you can forget about sleeping ."
576,"My friend and I went to this hotel using a spa package with overnight stays. To be honest, we were a little disappointed. As for the advantages, it is definitely worth mentioning the hotel restaurant a la carte - good service, exotic food and delicious wine. As for the spa - massage Okay, facial treatment - tragedy - does not even want to go into details, because it is a pity to say so. As for the service - at the reception could be nice, lobby bar - bartender who does not know what kind of champagne hotel serves, underdeveloped parking system - in the price of the pact was also a parking lot, but every time we wanted to go by car we had to explain that the parking lot we have in the price of the stay, which of course had to be verified by the guard, and it took a good few minutes. In a word, we are not likely to return here."
577,"Course: Policonductor instruments 1 Lecture Grade: Can be with Mr. Doctor, you will surely learn a lot. The script is very weak, but there is a doctor's manuscript circulating on the Internet, which is worth acquiring and forging. The lecture leads understandably, is quite nice. As for the evaluation, you can see that it is very demanding, every detail can catch and ruthlessly cuts points. For example, if you describe the whole question beautifully and you make a mistake in the JFET transistor symbol, e.g. . in the arrow it can hit zero for the question, """
578,"Hello I had 3 attempts to buy this TV : 1 . The delivered Q9 TV had a curved case - truth . it happened in transport or factory defect ? Return . 2 . The second case was a strongly flickering edge light module on the right . Return . 3 . Third case of TV is OK but I noticed strong banding (vertical lines) while watching scenes on uniform grey or dark blue background colour - now I am waiting for Samsung service center's opinion whether they will replace TV or just the LCD panel itself . I advise against buying at the moment, until the Samsung Q9F will grow out of childhood diseases."
579,"I've been a patient of Dr. Iwona Olejniczak - Gnach for over 10 years and I can't imagine it could be any other doctor. Your Dr. Iwona Olejniczak has never let me down. I have absolute confidence in her. She combines top-notch professionalism with an extremely warm, empathetic and tactful approach to the patient. She can patiently and as long as the situation and the patient requires, explain and talk about the problem that has come at the moment. My daughter is also the Doctor's patient and fully shares my opinion. It is impossible not to mention the whole Clinic Team - competent professionals who infect with smile, warmth and kindness. Amazing, even magical atmosphere in Unident Union Clinic does not resemble the waiting room of a dental office at all. I recommend it with all my heart because both the doctor and the clinic created by her are worthy of the highest recommendation."
580,"Service ok - they tried . Room - tragedy - small, tight, dirty, without duvet (only blanket + pillow and sheet). Everywhere the dirt, the TV remote control was stuck in hands, a thick layer of dust on the furniture. Hotel about 30 minutes on foot from Victoria Station. In the room the nearby subway is rumbling, the floor squeaks, you can hear the neighbors - every movement can be heard in the rooms next door, at night you have the impression that you are sleeping at the station. During the day, all the time renovations on the street - so you can hear knocking, drilling, etc. - it just didn't bother me because most of the stay was 'em at that time outside the hotel."
581,"I was on a doctor's appointment and unfortunately I have to give a negative opinion. Instead of looking for the cause of my headache and migraine, she started to suggest that it was a migraine from nerves (although she assured me that I am a very calm person) and I should probably go to a psychologist and a psychiatrist, because my health is all right. I love how doctors try to tell a patient that something is wrong with his psyche if they can't find the source of the problem. As it turned out later, she suffers from lambliosis and it is she who causes constant migraines, but the doctor didn't even think for a moment not to send her back to another doctor and that my migraines could be caused by something, even though she told her about my health and health problems. A wise doctor based on the symptoms she told me should know that there is something wrong with my body and refer me to another examination or to another specialist."
582,"In her opinion, attempts to control the biological clock without proper knowledge may aggravate the body's dysfunction. Dysfunctions occur e.g. in people working in shifts. Research shows that most accidents at work happen between two and five in the morning. ""This is the time when our clock says that it is a time to sleep and not work - it is the time when you are least able to concentrate and most sleepy,"" he adds. Shift work increases the risk of sleep disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases. Research conducted in Denmark on a very large population of nurses working for several decades in such a system proved that the risk of breast cancer was higher in them than in nurses working only during standard hours during the day, they were more likely to have problems with getting pregnant and carrying it and irregular periods."
583,"The plus point is. The rooms are standard for * * , the hotel has aspirations to be more than just an overnight stay for the workers . Spacious rooms. Good breakfast. And that's it. Now, bad things. No hot water in the morning, just a cold bath. Poorly isolated rooms, you can hear everything in the corridor. Location - very weak, the neighborhood is uninteresting, dark, problem with communication with the center in the late evening / early night. And on a piece of paper in the room, it says that one person is only entitled to one set of bed linen and towels, otherwise a surcharge for the other person. Either take your bed linen and towels or count on your losses."
584,"Prof . Chris Seal from the University of Newcastle explained: ""Increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with the reduction of cardiovascular disease, improved development and functioning of the nervous system, and better immune system. As he comments, the Western European diet is considered to be too poor in these fatty acids - European Food Safety Authority. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends doubling their consumption. ""However, it is difficult to get enough of them from our diet. Our research suggests that the switch to organic products may have some impact on increasing the intake of these important nutrients"", points out Prof . Seal . A systematic review of the scientific literature from around the world has shown that organic milk and meat have a more desirable fatty acid profile than conventionally produced milk and meat. Most importantly, a shift from conventional to organic products would increase the intake of omega-3 fatty acids without simultaneously increasing the amount of calories supplied and undesirable saturated fats."
585,"I recommend the Doctor. The price of a visit to a private office is not exorbitant, but rather the same as more or less the prices of visits to private doctors. In addition, the price for each visit is made ultrasound, the doctor does not charge extra for cytology. Very cool is that the doctor always asks about your well-being and always has time to listen to the questions or doubts he answers. He answers questions about the ultrasound he is doing or describes what he is doing. He does not direct to the tens of unnecessary examinations, but to those that are necessary and sufficient to assess the patient's condition. He is nice and his way of being is as relaxed as possible during the whole visit and examination."
586,"Generally speaking, the hotel is well located, pleasant, nice rooms. Admittedly, a bit of chaos during breakfast, because a lot of people were at that time and you had to get to the tables with the others and the staff were taking away the plates from the guests who hadn't finished eating yet, but it was nothing like that. But when it comes to room 062, which got 'em, you could write a whole book here. At first glance, no objections, clean, nice, neat. However, with time, it turned out that with two nights, not a single full night's sleep, in this room you just can't sleep. The room seems to work like a tube that multiplies sounds, it is terribly dimmed, located directly on the street, where with the windows closed, you can perfectly hear the conversations of people who pass by. Not to mention the cars. . . But that's not all, somewhere behind the wall, every few minutes you can hear some kind of mechanism loudly and I don't know what it was, whether it was some kind of transformer station, or elevator mechanisms, or something else, nevertheless, in the morning such sounds lead to a passion. Besides, you can hear the showers and the water flowing down in the adjoining rooms, so much so that you can hear the water flowing down the walls and going on. I'm almost certain that if I had spent a few days there a few more days, I would have been able to draw out the arrangement of the pipes in the walls. To sum up, the first night woke 'em up a few times during the night, while the second night woke 'em up at 4 and they had not fallen asleep anymore. For me, when a man goes on a journey, the hotel room serves as a place of peace where a man can get some sleep to spend the next day productively, and this has not been guaranteed in this case. I reported this problem to the reception, where the ladies did not behave courteously, artificially tried to alleviate the situation, but they did not feel responsible in any way and even mocked me to some extent. Today I regret this choice, I will probably never use this hotel again, even though I think other rooms in this hotel may not have this problem."
587,"It's OK. The rooms are tidy and clean. A modest but completely sufficient breakfast . High quality service, kind and helpful. Bathroom in the room small, but I with a big belly fit em quietly in the shower. Location due to the distance from the center is not the best, but communication takes care of it. Generally I recommend ."
588,hm we were on our way there on the way that the slope to the people's dinner much cozy waiter nicely built the atmosphere . . . the end of positives the child ate Russian dumplings described plus the chef I ordered 'a big cave ' cake in Hungarian ' what with a big sauce sauce spicy one tentacle piece of meat bill for 2 portions of dumplings my cake 2 pepsi some water and a soup 120 coz if they land too close to the slope ok but if for food . . . . . .
589,"As if there is a possibility of giving a minus point, it's all right. The reception desk is uninformed, the rooms are poor, the parking is paid for and there are no places, in addition not refreshed. The food is bad, and the lady in the canteen is terrible and splashing. The building received EU subsidies, but the whole amount went in the socks of the ""President"". . . . Avoid this evil"
590,". . . . .that's great. The support changes the schedule of the busy couple without any problems and adapts it to the couple's proposals. Very professional fitness instructors, eager to share their knowledge. I have not managed to ask a question that would not be left unanswered. Tasty food and energy value well matched to the guest's lifestyle. Treatments in the SPA very pleasant and professionally made . The only downside was the lack of air in the radiators in the room and the lack of traffic jam in the sink, into which a small soap notoriously fell. I strongly recommend and I will come back!"
591,"Location super at a large square where on Saturday there was a market with wines, series etc. rooms ok, beds ok no toilets in the rooms In one sink only and in the other sink and cabin and probably wrote a bathroom in the room. Breakfast good"
592,"I only give two stars. Of course, I confirm the opinions of others about the atmosphere and the doctor herself - stress-free, pleasant, culturally. Unfortunately, the prices of services are terribly high. She gave up my treatment there, because after a few visits she realized that I spend an awful lot of money and the effects are not visible. The communication chaos - after one visit or while I'm lying in the chair and I can't say a word, I find out that you have to do a little more with a given tooth. Ok, I understand. But I do not hear what and for how much, and if I am not asked if I want to continue . It is only when paying for the service that it turns out that it is a few hundred zloty more than she planted m . . . . And unfortunately, a tooth treated with a canal and under a microscope still hurts today! And it cost me 800 PLN. I am really disappointed. Therefore, if someone has a basic problem and needs ordinary treatment, I do not advise against the doctor. But if it promises to be something bigger - I recommend looking for someone cheaper, transparent as far as prices are concerned, and above all - more effective."
593,I went to the doctor's office with the pain that I asked for a visual inspection of the filling of the teeth for 60s (not even a mammal was used). The doctor didn't even try to check if the tooth reacts to the cold and then I heard that I have to go to 2 of your dentist of course for another visit (working in the same plant) to determine whether or not to treat it (and the tooth as it hurts so much) and worse this 60s pleasure cost me 100zl. When I ask you what we will do about it today. If the control for such money is carried out so thoroughly I prefer not to know what the treatment looks like.
594,"In addition to the tampering signals between the two test centres, the data must be transmitted in the system for audio/video data. And this is where the engineers meet the main challenge. The challenge is to transport the image over long distances as quickly as possible. The difficulty is that the high-resolution HD image contains very large amounts of data which must reach the operator elsewhere from the operating field through the endoscopic system. Only small delays are acceptable, otherwise doctors find it difficult to coordinate movements with the image that reaches their eyes. The speed at which the signal reaches the operator is key to the success of the operation. The biggest source of delays is not the transmission of the signal itself, but most of the time is consumed by the necessary change of its format from the original to the one adapted for transmission on the Ethernet network. ""The image from a medical or industrial camera must be converted without any significant loss of quality. The conversion , i.e. the change of image format must take place at the source, where the image is downloaded , then via Ethernet connection the image is sent to the operator and there it must be converted again to be displayed on a monitor or other video elements "" - explains dr inż .

595,"I warn you before buying this model. The phone broke down after 4 days and the service is almost 2 months! Nokia's complaints department will make you wait patiently for the end of repair. How much will it be 6m - or maybe a year and so until the end of the warranty. I understand, everything may break down but the deadline for repair is outrageous. There is no need for help from the Complaints Department. It's a waste of time and nerves. That's not what I expected 'em to do after the business class call. This phone call is a rather heavy joke and a total misunderstanding. Please watch out for positive comments to this model because they can be written for money . Reading some of them, I say that the writers didn't have the phone in their hands at all. Before making a purchase, please read the reviews carefully on the internet, touch the store, take into account the repair time under warranty and make a choice. As for the warranty, I immediately suggest you return the goods for non-conformity with the contract - it will be much faster."
596,"Visit and treatment of Hashimoto's disease. A very silent visit will not add anything to the questions and answers them in one word. The visit does not add anything new about the disease. Prescribing the drug dose and the end of the visit . During a few months of treatment change the drug dose several times . All you have to do is call the doctor and tell him that you feel badly about changing your dose to more or less and so over and over again within a few months. Loss of nerves, money and time. Giving up the doctor. I wouldn't recommend maybe other infertility diseases, but certainly not Hashimoto's disease. All the more reason why he was chosen from the clinic in Katowice. Failure."
597,"A good place for a relaxing trip for two. Nice hotel, clean rooms, well equipped. The hotel's professional service, despite a small mistake that happened with the room you booked (you booked an apartment and received a lux room), we were offered a satisfactory compensation. Tasty meals, the number of dishes is also ok, everyone will find something for themselves. Nice swimming pool, which in the morning hours was empty so we could swim only in the two of us: ) The most important thing is to count the service in the SPA center. Very professionally performed treatments, prices quite affordable, everyone should leave satisfied! : )"
598,"One big * * * * * * The manufacturer gives 1 teaspoon sweetens like 3 teaspoons of sugar which is not true . I say I buy myself a pudding and make light pudding with stevia . Initially he added 2 teaspoonfuls of stevia (6 teaspoonfuls of sugar and 3 teaspoonfuls of sugar according to the manufacturer). He added em so much because he writes on the packaging of the pudding to pour 3 tablespoons of sugar. It wasn't very sweet at the very beginning of the process (but I think that maybe after it is done it will be better). It also had a bitter taste. So I poured 'em into the pot and trimmed the slightly sweet and bitter pudding. I say I will test the sweetness compared to the manufacturer's description, I will add 2 more spoonfuls, still not enough, so another 2 spoonfuls. At the moment I had the same calorie pudding as after adding the usual sugar, but the taste unfortunately remained bitter, also the sweetness has not yet reached the same point than if I made a second pudding with white sugar . I still didn't test 'em because I don't want to get poisoned with this natural sweetener. So if someone wants to lose weight with this stevia sweetener, I recommend white sugar - sucrose. Less put in, better effect, better aroma and also taste."

801,"A new online sales platform for the hotel has appeared on the market. We do not send stupidity: ) The internet service called Bidroom, as e-hotelarz.pl informs, is supposed to be a tool connecting guests with hotels, but in a different way than traditionally accepted. The customer fills in a classic form, in which he or she enters all the necessary information, such as dates, number of people and special requirements. The message is then sent to the hotels together with an invitation to make an offer or even bid among themselves. The whole process takes a maximum of 24 hours."
802,"She felt like on a standard visit to the National Health Fund, that is, quickly, briefly, she knows everything best why to listen to the patient. It seems that the doctor has the knowledge, I do not intend to question it, however, coming in private and paying for the visit, a slightly different approach is expected. The most important thing that has alienated me. . . Sitting in line, there were a few people in front of me, she heard me word for word what the doctor was talking to the patient about. When it was my turn, I realized that everyone would also hear about my problems, tragedy - no privacy, I felt very uncomfortable."
803,"Every third guest is not a member of any hotel loyalty program. Every fourth guest participates in one program, and every fifth guest in two. Four or more programs are attended by slightly more than 14% of guests, according to a study * carried out for the purposes of "" A Restoration in Hotel Loyalty Developing a blueprint for reinventing loyalty programs "" (in a fairly arbitrary translation: "" Refreshment of hotel loyalty: development of a plan for building loyalty programs "" ) prepared by the Travel / Hospitality department of Deloitte consulting company."
804,"I don't recommend this doctor to anyone. Maria makes mistakes in dental and orthodontic treatment . She puts on a crown that is leaking, if you go to her with a complaint she does not recognize it and the crown has to be replaced somewhere else, not to mention the fact that under the crown at that time the caries form. She puts on braces without making an X-ray, so this is not the procedure. I was her patient myself and I resigned because the doctor put on braces that required earlier root canal treatment Thanks to her so-called care, I lost one tooth and did not continue the orthodontic treatment because I had to choose between healthy teeth and straight teeth. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! ! !"
805,"I strongly advise against using this hostel. The four-person room! was so small that 2 people can hardly function there. All the equipment is 2 old and dirty beds, a shelf and a chair + a table. Everything squeezed on these few meters of surface. Not even a hanger is there to hang jackets or other clothes. A nightmarish decoration, completely unobtrusive. But taste is a secondary issue. The worst was the dirt - dust, cobwebs. The bed linen is not fresh and torn, torn. Stained cushions thrown into a corner and that kind of attraction. Bathrooms dirty, the floor eternally flooded, sinking in the mud. 2 bathrooms completely open, so it is difficult to keep any intimacy, even elementary. The kitchen, yes it is, but breakfast is worse. We came to the first day at an hour. 10 (breakfasts are supposed to be 11 o'clock) and we found 1 slice of bread and a few slices of cucumber! Horror! On request, where is breakfast? The lady from the reception - with an offended face, put out a few pieces of bread and sliced cucumber. And that is all. The next day a slight improvement, but this is because we were at breakfast about 9. Generally a failure! The service leaves a lot to be desired, the guests as if they don't count, they are. . . . .it's hard. The receptionist at 4 in the morning chatted all over the phone. Generally, it's a terrible nuisance, except for the sloppy and dirty noise at night. Raging Spaniards, screaming, besides mega loud discussions with the receptionists. No stopwatches are necessary, and they still don't give much! The only advantage of this pseudo-hostel is its very good location - close to the center. In general, I strongly advise against staying in this place! ! ! ! ! Dramatic conditions! even for the price. Just a shame!"
806,"very nice and probably with a lot of theoretical knowledge and that's where it ends. . A very distracted person, often forgot about the research and interpretation of the results, which he later denied; during the visit he said that he would write down some medicines and then forgot to write this prescription, she had a lot of confidence in him, but he let them down. I don't think it's worth attending professors because they have too many other duties (hospital, private practice, students, scientific work...) to talk to patients (I'll add that she had a visit in her private gab)."
807,"We strongly recommend after skiing. Lots of jacuzzis, lots of attractions, wide wellness offer. For us it is the best swimming pool and leisure complex that we have visited. I leave out the issues of appearance, maybe it could be nicer, but for me more importantly concrete. Many different attractions made us spend 2 - 2.5 hours there every day. After skiing, the ideal place to rest and get rid of any leaven."
808,"Hello, today I joined the group of people who are being treated by your doctor. So far I cannot say too much about the effectiveness of the treatment. Doctor, very calm, calm. She reacted immediately to every my aversion to the proposed medication, because she has already undergone a lot of specifics in the previous treatment."
809,"It was a quick buy on already and I must admit it worked. She saw me here some comments that the headphones sit too tightly on my head. . . . .well, it's a private matter - one will be comfortable, the other won't. It's great with me (but I also like it when I feel that when I nod my head right now I don't order it), good sound, the microphone, the wire on which the microphone is on is very flexible, so you can set it according to your needs. At the end of the look: plain, black, minimalistic headphones. This is what tigers like the most."
810,"Actually, I didn't find out anything to em, during the examination he heard 'em, all softly' and that there's something reddened, but what is it that's an unknown, a prescription for suppositories and as if something was going on, please come'. for 150 zloty for a visit which, together with the examination, lasted as long as I waited in front of the doctor's office. At me she started to write a summary, letting me know that this is the end of the visit, expected me to be more involved with the doctor, the more so that I am after radiotherapy, there is no frenzy! ! !"
811,"Cool - nice lock, at least from the outside and very friendly service. At this end of the pros . Minus - Cold! The room was really cold. Maybe January is not the best month for this place. But then you would have to close the hotel until spring. The furnishings are already old, and it's not that ancient : ) unfortunately, just worn out. Bathrooms to renovate . Restaurant ok but prices like in sheraton - a slight exaggeration . To sum up: the people who work there save the situation and you can give them 5 stars. The rest as in a 2-star motel with an expensive restaurant. I recommend sightseeing, not overnight!"

813,"Everything I could expect has been done at the highest level. Pulse of professionalism, great contact, wonderful care after surgery. I underwent surgery to hang my breasts and the only thing I'm not satisfied with is the size. The doctor likes small sizes very much and every girl is pushed to a smaller size. However, you have to remember that the breasts come out smaller than they seem at first (after trying on the inserts), so you have to choose a larger size. I did not choose it because the doctor said that it is not true that breasts will be smaller than it seems at first. And unfortunately. I spent 14,000 golden ones I had a small b before the surgery, I have a big b after the surgery. A little difference, a big gap in my wallet. But for the doctor's defense, the breasts look really nice. I recommend it very much, but remember the girls, insist on your own and do not be afraid of bigger sizes!"
814,"Hotel from the outside as well as inside nothing. Very nice, actually. Service nice nothing to accuse. Pools and facilities for children super . But that would be enough. Canteen or Dining Room or otherwise you can't call it that made me stunned . It reminded me a little of a milk bar . Even though the food is good and there's nothing to stick to, the rest sucks. I felt like I was in the school canteen. Plus, for almost $5,000, we got a room with a view of the yard and the canteen. The sound of folding dishes made it impossible to use the terrace in the evening. As I personally do not recommend, for such money they could offer something better. They won't see me there anymore. Greetings"
815,"Generally I do not recommend this center, problems with ventilation in the bathrooms, the windows are flooded with water, stinks, in the cabins mushroom and mildew, dust on the furniture, the lack of a cleaner to throw away the garbage, not to mention the lack of changing towels. Meals not good tasteless, containers with spices dirty and glued, no sugar in confectioners, during the meal you have to ask for plates and pieces of art, not much of how she asked the waiter to add the food it still talked to me so I guess I mistaken the competition the Lord. SAUNNA - people, when she saw me, I wonder if I should call the sanitarium, but don't go there because you will get some kind of illness. It went well to write and write, but I think you've had enough. . . . . . .total failure."
816,"Departure in November 2014 . - Very poorly ! * Reception open until 19 - then no one who can help you, advise you, etc . * If the keys do not work for you at the entrance, there may be a problem with entering after 22, because they close the guesthouse and if the magnetic card did not work for us, nobody answered the phone for a long time until the disgusted and angry owner came out, who with grace and without a word of apology - after half an hour in the cold! He let us in. * The lady at the reception desk - if she is, she keeps answering the phone, completely disregarding the hotel guests. Also, be patient, because you are not the most important. Potential new guests are more important! * You can't go back in the evening on foot because the road to the guesthouse is unlit and set about wading through the complete darkness and the fields for a few minutes, which will not be pleasant. A little funny and pathetic. . . . So take the kettle and tea from home ; ) * Nothing can be eaten in the evening, ordered, etc. . . And at the reception desk there are outdated leaflets about pubs nearby! * Breakfast is modest, and lunch is calculated for the person. No choice but to eat very modest and small portions. . . . So we rather recommend eating out! * The rooms aren't dimmed at all. . . You can hear everything exactly who, what he's talking about, what he's coming back about, etc. . . It's hard to sleep in the morning, as the bustle begins in the guesthouse, so don't count on a long and quiet rest!"
817,"The hotel, where we were laughing at by accident, and we had to change hotel, where, as it turned out upon arrival, the renovation was not completed on time. What a surprise it was for us to come to this hotel, which was much better than our bought! The hotel is quite small, but you have to reckon with the fact that in the center of Alanya we will find only small hotels, so if someone is looking for large resorts, unfortunately, must take into account that it will certainly be much further away from Alanya. However, for those who want to spend their vacation close to the center, this hotel is very recommendable. Very nice rooms, clean, well-maintained, without any problems. The food is very tasty with a big choice. Very helpful and friendly service, which knows all tourists by heart, in a small hotel. There are two swimming pools in the hotel and the beach is very close to the beach, the people will cross the street. As for me, the hotel is worth recommending for those who appreciate the intimate atmosphere, proximity to the center and the beach."
819,"To be honest, I don't really know what kind of opinion I have to give. . . . For such a price, she expected me to do more. . . . . .45 PLN an adult. . . . . 135 zł package for a mother with child . . . 2h in the pool + 2h in the playland + dinner . . . The pool is quite OK, while for a 7-year-old child the only entertainment was a slide . . . . .I won't say cool, but it's probably not much. Playland. . . . .really good, but the tickets weren't checked at all and anyone could go in there, so I don't know why she paid for it. Dinner. . . . .as for the buffet pretty good, while the craze wasn't. I was hit by a portion already lying down, so cold, many things missing, the staff as if uninformed and a little lost. I recommend to families with children on rainy days. Maybe one day I will take advantage of some package for a longer stay. . . maybe it will be better : - )"
820,"A large hotel complex 10 kilometres from the Baltic Sea and Slupsk. On site a lot of attractions: Swimming pool and sauna complex, SPA, Fitness Room (well equipped), fish ponds with the possibility of fishing (for a fee), ZOO - surprisingly large, well-kept with the possibility of a trip by boat and with a sealarium. Parking for free. Eating within the stay OK . Bowling alley and Pub . Rooms are spacious, clean, friendly service. Around the hotel, kilometers of paths for walking, running, cycling. I recommend rooms with a view of the lakes. There is an amphitheatre in the complex, once a year there is a festival of rock stars in the next year I plan to go."
821,"The only advantage is the location. And now the downsides: - microscopic rooms - dust absolutely everywhere - low quality towels, old, not mentioned during the stay - food reminds us of school canteens - dark treatment rooms, ugly with paint peeling off the walls - massages are not performed on massage tables - guests are persuaded to improper, but very expensive treatments (after refusing to buy them, she was even asked from the room of the doctor. . . ) - when signing up for treatments, their description is different from the one actually performed. I recommend visiting Nałęczów, but definitely in a different place."
822,"The Rector of the Medical University of Warsaw, Professor Marek Krawczyk stated that Poland is not exempting itself from introducing innovative solutions to medicine. ""We are obliged to do so under the Lisbon Treaty. The European Union is striving to strengthen its scientific base, and Poland is facing this challenge"" - he added . Deputy Marshal Karczewski stressed that progress in medicine is enormous. ""Today we cure diseases which until recently were incurable, there are people who have not been given a chance to survive"" - he stressed . He added that new therapies not only generate costs but also reduce them. An example is hospitalization . In the past, after a heart attack the patient stayed in hospital for at least 10 days, and often even a few weeks, today after a life-saving interventional cardiology procedure he can return home the next day. The same is true for a caesarean section."
823,"I'm fresh from a week's stay at the Sandra Hotel in Karpacz - I'll start with the fact that Sandra Hotels in Karpacz and Pogorzelica have already visited em many times and so far recommended them to others despite the considerable price. This time I DISCONTINUED for this money you will really be disappointed with the price. And now the details : - For four days of our stay, we had the sound of hotel renovation, drilling, etc. At 7:00 a.m. and for example after 10:00 p.m., the sound of a drilling machine - the unsavoury manager said they couldn't help it - ""such a company does it at their place"" - as a compensation, they offered an hour in the sauna (I don't use it) - the food that I used to praise them in these hotels was now terrible - everything as if it was done at a culinary workshop. The chef, who proudly parades in a big hat, cannot even fry a simple chicken fillet because he serves it raw. Ribs from the oven is just a failure, in addition, you can bite the worm cherries (and that they were worm-like you can see immediately). In general, most of the travelling dishes are insidious - you can eat cakes for dinner - because it was quite a bit. The kitchen staff - the chef is unpleasant as if he was punished. - In general, the hotel staff is kind of cozy - especially you at the reception, but I think it has to do with your manager. - As for the swimming pools and rescuers - Sandra is promoting herself with these pools - if you want to look at the handrails glued with adhesive tape and foam of dirt floating in the Jacuzzi I invite you - the pool is filled because the hotel lets in people from outside making money on it. The rescuers can not answer the good morning - they have been given by the rest of the team. - As for the rooms and the hotel is a ghost, but the room itself can be. So to sum up, if you want to overpay them to bathe in a dirty pool, eat bad food and watch the sour faces of the staff be my guest ; ) This is my first opinion and I wrote it to 'em so they don't cut themselves going there for the first time."
824,"After two visits, she switched to another doctor. Not very communicative, ignoring the patient, quick examination, not very sensitive. You have to ask about everything. She tried to find out how to treat the erosion he detected, then he told me that now there is no cure in fashion. I can take globules. How long? Until I'm bored. It's not professional medical advice to me. All the more so because there are other treatments and, above all, a more accurate diagnosis."
825,"I've been to your doctor's twice and I regret every visit. In the first pregnancy I was worried about some triviality, but of course she read me on the Internet just terrible things so she made an appointment with the doctor, who had a free appointment and unfortunately she found me on p Saif : ( . The doctor literally laughed at me. The visit in a private institution lasted 5 minutes and the doctor even didn't even or something else bothered me how it feels. The second visit was a second pregnancy and an ultrasound examination. A similar situation. Due to the absence of the attending doctor she had to make an appointment with another doctor for the last one before the delivery of ultrasound (third trimester). The doctor called me to the office with a few minutes delay - even though the previous visit ended 10 minutes before the deadline. During the examination, she got the information that everything is fine, but before giving me the description of the examination Ms. Doctor said that she did not do half of the tests, which are performed for the third trimester because she does not have time for it and I have to make an appointment for another visit. She said with a smile that since the child had all the organs on the previous tests, now they have not evaporated and it is rather not necessary to check it: ( . After all, this is what the first, second and third trimester tests are about - to thoroughly examine the child's anatomy. I will never see such an approach and such comments from the doctor, even though in the previous twin pregnancy I had an ultrasound every two weeks. I have never been told by my doctor that he did not examine something because there is no time - even in situations where the visit time was the same as a single pregnancy. I strongly advise against Mr Janczak-Saif."
826,"A great hotel with very polite service, although a bit sluggish. Breakfast is very good, although the lunches that we had bought could have been to choose from and I did not always like it. The pool is clean, in the salt cave very cozy. We rested one hundred percent. The rooms are well maintained. Prices at the bar low . The downside is that the staff does not bring orders from the bar to the room. . ."
827,"Mr. Dr. has not made a good impression on me. Apparently he was in a hurry and only wanted to pay a visit, even though it was private. I had a problem with my throat, so Mr. Dr. ignored that I'm fine. Strange that a few days later I got even more sick. . . . .the only thing he suggested was a tonsil cutter. I went to another doctor and it turned out that because of the sore throat is somewhere else and my tonsils are all right. Additionally, he suggested that I should have a nasal septum surgery where I don't need one because I don't have any more problems with breathing. ."
828,"On the PLUS: a beret throw from the public transport stops (Bagatela Theatre) and the Old Town. Nice, helpful receptionist; a modest breakfast as part of the stay (until 10 am) ON THE MINUS: everywhere quite dirty, in mega poor condition of the bathroom, 9-person room - very small, consisted of as many as 3 - ech three-storey beds; terribly uncomfortable mattress, hard and feel all the springs; after 24 you have to ring the doorbell and you have to wait for someone to come down from the reception desk; the cost of a towel 5 zł (returnable deposit 5 zł), deposit for keys to the room and locker (15 zł); problem with maintaining communication with Wi - Fi;"
829,"Usually, as I take up writing a hotel review I think about room, comfort, service, surroundings, amenities and extra entertainment. In this case I think only about food. It was insane. At every dinner, I was looking forward to what the chef would surprise me with this time, even though at breakfast, I chose the main course myself. Something incredible! Of course, all the minor things from the first sentence are also of the highest level: ) PSDo Saalbach - Hinterglemm went to the bicycle. The hotel provided us with a ski lift to keep the equipment, but it would be worth thinking about dedicated racks during the summer. Besides, it took about 56 seconds to the nearest ski lift and the Jokercard provided solid entertainment for the whole day: )"
830,"The hotel is well located, not far from the so-called center of Argassi, but in the evening, and that's a plus on the sidelines of the hustle and bustle. The rooms are clean, cleaned, the bathroom is spacious, the TV with 3 Polish programs two did not watch 'em (Trwam and TV Polonia) and the third one is 4fan TV, the food is quite ok, heard 'em voices that around still the same, maybe and so, but tasty, I liked it, and here I wouldn't be bothered. The canteen is quite large, but so to speak, together with the reception, which at the time when new guests arrive and dinner is held, for example, looks a little comical, because the queue to the reception for a key and registration, sometimes bothering guests who want to eat for example . dinner (I had so had, the whole bus arrived). Another disadvantage is that the WiFi works only in the lobby and sometimes it is terribly slow as the proverbial harvester (sending photos for example takes ages, not to mention movies), and finally, even though it is a hotel offering All inclusive is after 23 - the drinks and drinks are paid 1 , 5 Euro, I still would not happen to have the option all inclusive was em limited in time. Entertainment team like me was em boring but maybe every time it is different and it's like it can change."
831,"Course : Physics 2 Laboratories Evaluation : Avoid [ / b ] The doctor is a physics fanatic. From the very beginning she started telling us that physics is our hobby. She believes that physics is the most important subject and we should understand it well ( supposedly truth : P ) . Once or twice, in a semester, she makes a pass, which is usually very difficult to pass, also you have to fly for consultations and get tired later. In the labs themselves, he always asks, and in great detail, he can kick the shit out of a little bit. Do not just learn from the instructions! ! ! ! Every notion you don't understand from the instructions must be found on the Internet and you must learn solidly. It asks for every phenomenon that has a pedestal to do with a given exercise. It is also not easy with reports, although here it does not return so often. That is why I do not recommend if you have a choice anywhere else: )"
832,"Prof . Bernatowska admits that there are still cases of rubella among young men in our country. The data of the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene in Warsaw show that in the first half of 2013 over 32 thousand infections were registered - almost ten times more than in the same period of 2012. ""The disease should no longer occur in any European Union country,"" the specialist emphasizes. In Poland, however, it is not associated with vaccination avoidance, but with an incomplete vaccination programme. Since 1988 only girls aged 13 years have been vaccinated against rubella; boys have not been vaccinated. Therefore, there was a so-called ""compensatory epidemic"": the disease attacked mainly men aged 19-24 and slightly older than 25-28 years."
833,"Eating about but 1 . 5 h waiting for lunch . There is no room for 21 g for families with a child - only ""cigar club"" open. Saunas and recreation area nicely finished but the pool is very small in "" rush hour "" that is 17 - 20 no possibility of swimming - crowded . I strongly advise against this price."
834,"Garmin vivoactive hr is one big failure and money thrown into the mud. I don't know if any of the testers have checked it, but I think it's worth it. . . This is the third watch replaced by the service and every time a new one is sent back, which does not work like the previous one. First of all, the step counter is an embarrassment. The simplest step counter with an allegro works a lot better than a professional watch for over £1200. Are you sleeping? Then you have to take a picture of your watch because otherwise you get up and it turns out that you have taken 600 steps. Go on. . . you sit on the ergometer, turn on the stationary ergometer and record your activity from the egometer plus. . . 1500 steps per rowing hour . That's rather absurd. Since you already know that this watch does not have a pedometer, you should not worry about the calories burned from the steps because it is already a curiosity. Today - 1,55 km in steps, which gives according to the manufacturer. . . . 1301 calories burned! ! ! ! He wanted the world to look so colorful, but it looks very bad, especially Garmin's technical support. All nice and helpless. The result - 3 months I have a watch, the third one and it is useless because it is not working. I definitely do not recommend"
835,"Another visit to the hotel . This time I was thinking long about the evaluation . Unfortunately, the hotel looks worse and worse. The first impression is great. The large hotel, the reception desk, the smiling lady at the entrance, which shows that she cares about making the guest feel as good as possible in the hotel. In my case, the check-in time is about 2 minutes, including the check-in card. We get the card to the room and there. . . . The room is nicely decorated, but still in the bathroom, the problem of overflowing water remained additionally loosening on the door were removed in a ""professional"" way - cut out and we can see beautiful plywood on the door. The room as such clean, air conditioning works efficiently and quietly. The bed is comfortable although as for me a little too soft. The way of solving the shower and the chemistry used by the hotel makes the tiles under your feet get slippery during the bath so be careful! Breakfast, unfortunately, for a 4-star hotel is rather unacceptable, there is a lack of fruit, something that when the customer goes down for breakfast he will think - WOW - great. Unfortunately, here we can find a standard that is very often offered by lower class hotels. In addition, paid parking is a bit of a stretch for the customer but it is the policy of the hotel itself or the owners. To sum up: the advantages: clean, neat, comfortable, friendly service. Minus: shower, breakfast could be better. However, compared to other hotels in Lubin. 4 is a good rating"
836,"What a scumbag. First and last time he bought 'em a product of a crap company . There is no audio aux ! ! ! ! My first tv from 30 years ago had . Some strange youtube without the possibility of logging in or connecting to the phone. It's good that although netflix works perfectly. Some stripes on the matrix, no tragedy. As they pass by the tir is the TV flies forward and backward because it is on plastic tiny feet bbbaaa very poor quality. I do not recommend to anyone. Maybe there is no tragedy to watch TV but I liked to play music on youtube through the tower and here I can not."
837,"I recommend it to everyone who feels lost. If you feel motivated to change and want to talk about what is inhibiting / tormenting / paralyzing you, Agnieszka will help you to identify the source of the problem and indicate the direction of self-realization. I can say with full conviction that Ms. Agnieszka is a psychologist by vocation. Already during the first visit the hearing, empathic reactions and trying to name the problem brought me a clear calm, I started to think about what is really important to me. As a result, I put my everyday life and emotional life in order - Thank you Agnieszka. I recommend it."

839,"At the beginning I will start with the advantages such as location - revelation, hotel visually inside and outside very nice. I really like the climate. The rooms are very nice neat and clean. Spa pretty nice and pleasant, here also was clean although the pool could be a bit bigger but is ok. And that would be enough of the pluses. Let's start with maybe the biggest downside that is the restaurant. I'll point out that the food was edible and we didn't happen to be bad. None of that. However, for a hotel at 4 a.m. it's average. Food at 2 * . The organization of food delivery to the heaters average . People queuing up to get to scrambled eggs for example . One coffee maker and here also the queue . Pub ! Very nicely and stylishly decorated, however, tragedy service, no experienced staff, no active cleaning from the glass tables. Another very big minus is the lack of snacks. To sum up the hotel with a very high potential, however, it seems to me that the management of the hotel is crawling and is on a low level. Please take this into account because the hotel 4 * + customers may require something more. I don't write this after malice but as a person who knows the industry and knows what the standards are. I think I'll come back here one day and see if something has improved or not. I wish you good luck!"
840,"The loudspeaker was weak, overrated, bought 'em in Saturn and gave 'em back after 2 days. The loudspeaker plays dirty, it has a strangled treble as if it was playing under a pillow Up to 30% of the volume there is practically no bass, then only this bass rumbles. I don't understand why people praise this loudspeaker so much? Probably because they couldn't hear how the other speakers are playing and are guided in their purchase of design I finally bought 'em a Sony SRS xb3 and that's a speaker that plays right, loud and clear above all I recommend to discern the market instead of blind buying JBL. This is not a high-frequency speaker, but the price is. . ."
841,"I'm laughing at what I'm reading here. I'm going to see Dr. Bishop. M, the first time she went m also got m diet, (although she weighed m 52kg) but I have to admit that I feel much better, second time she also got m the same pills. My next visit - hmm. . . . . .is improving, and I'm feeling it myself. I don't have ovarian pains, where she used to have m day by day. And for those who are dissatisfied, I recommend that you find another doctor. I believe in Dr. . . M, and I am very pleased. And when it comes to expensive drugs, it's either better to tell the doctor that they're too expensive, or reckon that good treatment costs money. And to some people I recommend that they wait their adolescence, because when someone is an adult, he or she should take care of it himself or herself and not boast about the fact that even though they did not take drugs, the doctor noticed an improvement. Ehh. . . . . . . .it's a shame to write down. My husband and I are very pleased, thank you, Dr. Bishop. M. . . .we're on our way. And my sister-in-law goes to Dr. M.'s too. M . I recommend to anyone who has problems with their gynaecologist. Greetings"
842,"We have heard a lot about this place so we decided to check it out and go out for a weekend to rest. The hotel itself is not crazy, no standard for the prices they are forced to pay. Attractions that are offered additionally within the complex are the only marketing trick. . . . . .I only regret the animals that are there. . . The food is correct, but the restaurant menu is very limited to a few dishes to choose from I know many more interesting places in Poland where you can go for similar money and spend time better."
843,"Doctor, I am amazed at your approach to the patient. Unfortunately, I did not manage to get with my 5-year-old daughter for 2 visits to you (12 . 07 and 23 . 08 . 2014), which were cancelled: the first - 1 day before, the second - 1 hour and 15 minutes before the visit. In fact, we lost the patient's disregard for 2 months of waiting for the visit. The first time, we did not react because everyone understands unforeseen situations. I ask you, Doctor, for more respect for the time of others. I do not judge the competence because we were not given. Małgorzata Kucharska"
844,"That's the worst place 'em have been, located by the highway itself. It's an 80s-style moloch, splattered and completely tasteless. Problems with GSM and WIFI coverage and the staff do the grace of providing access. Bathrooms are dirty. Very expensive, that's too bad."
845,"The doctor was not interested in my ailments. I wasn't examined, even though I was signalled by persistent (and recurring) stomach pains. I am glad that the doctor did an ultrasound on me but did not receive a printout because I saved the result of the previous patient. I hope that the prescribed medicine will be helpful. It is a pity because I was hoping that I would be under constant gastrological control if the ailments did not go away. I do not recommend it. Blueberry"
846,"The Hilton brand has been present in Istanbul for 58 years. Conrad Hilton presents a model of the Hilton Istanbul hotel before the opening on 10 June 1955. The Hilton Istanbul , which was the second Hilton hotel in Europe, is today the oldest facility of the chain operating outside the United States. It has become famous for its beautiful modernist building and some interesting details - the Conrad Hilton footprint pool or the roof over the entrance in the shape of a flying carpet. The Hilton in Istanbul was also the first hotel to receive its own postcode and the first to be commemorated on a postage stamp."
847,"Location - very good, by the lake, large area, children's playground, tennis courts, lake with equipment rental Service - good and friendlyRestaurant - good Rooms in the main building scandalously low quality. Tight, dirty carpet, no wardrobe, no ventilation in the toilet and air conditioning."
848,"The hotel from outside is rather scared away. The owners could think about renovating the facade, a bit of colour would be very useful for this communist building. The rooms are neat and clean. Unfortunately the walls are thin, you can hear everything from other rooms. The service is nice and helpful. The biggest advantage of the hotel is the panoramic restaurant on the top floor, where delicious breakfasts are served to guests."
849,"Very nice, honest, professional, helpful service at every position. It stands out strongly e.g. against the background of the second hotel of this chain in the centre. It seems to be ok there, but here much better. Brilliant location. Delicious burger. Adequate price. Breakfast as in Hampton - good but . . . . .except for scrambled eggs ( egg mass ) . Free Wi - fi - medium ."
850,"The hotel is located a few minutes from the border crossing. It can be used as a starting point for travels in eastern Germany or as an overnight stay on a longer route to western Europe. The low price per day corresponds to the standard of the hotel, which definitely needs renovating. It is a hotel for tourists who do not expect anything but clean bedding and a place to refresh themselves, which is important in the journey. The building has a very ""cult"" look and equipment for lovers of the 70s. Enough bathrooms, always hot water, a kettle in the hallway at guests' disposal, nice staff. There is enough furniture in the rooms to place things. Televisions that remember the old times can be obtained to the room for an additional fee. Rooms are spacious. Wi - fi in the rooms generally works flawlessly. The restaurant next door to the hotel is not a nuisance when it comes to noise or smells, and serves delicious meals."
851,"In my opinion, Dr. Musiatowicz is a good doctor, she treated me with the doctor for about 2 years and I was very satisfied. He was also in my hospital at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration at Wojska Polskiego Street. He conducted a neurological examination as necessary. As far as the diagnosis is concerned he was also accurate. No objections."
852,"My opinion after the first visit: Mr. Doctor was from the beginning open and polite; - he was able to keep calm and clear mind despite the fact that he was not in good shape and it was difficult for me to collect my thoughts, which made it difficult to communicate; - professional - he did an interview, asked questions, listened and asked, took notes; - he supported his attitude; - he explained on an ongoing basis the issues which were also raised by me during the conversation, e.g.: - the doctor was a good friend of the doctor's. To sum up, Mr. Doctor from the very beginning has aroused my trust and until now this trust is in me, or rather I am not a trustworthy person. I can recommend this doctor to those of you who want to help themselves by going to a specialist. I wish everyone strength and perseverance in choosing the good. ""You can't beat the one who never gives up. "")"
853,"I strongly advise against. I'm a person who can't handle the heat very well, that's why I carry a fan with me on trips. When I talked to you about this on the phone, I was told that there is air conditioning in the room that you can normally use, so I should not take the fan with me. So did I, and when we arrived on the spot we received a room with one tiny window that does not open other than a tilt window, in which the temperature reached 35 degrees. The remote control for the air conditioning did not receive us, and when asked, it turned out that the air conditioning is paid additionally 15zł / day - the lady brazenly quarreled that she thought they read the website - a little stupid considering the fact that she called me with a question about a standard fan. As it turned out, I couldn't even use the fan because ""it generates additional power consumption and we can't use such devices. I felt cheated and had to look for a new accommodation in my car. Fortunately, she found me quickly cheaper and with a lovely lady, so the Eagle's Nest I advise against anyone who does not want to deal with a cheater."
854,"The hotel is well located, has a competent and willing to help. The rooms are completely satisfactory and from the upper floors there is a nice view of the mountains. From the breakfasts I always came out full of food. And all this at a reasonable price. If I'm going to spend the night in Bielsko-Biała, it's definitely in this Ibis."
855,"As I read these opinions it seems to me that I was em somewhere else, or the people writing them have minimum requirements. . . The hotel was overcrowded, it was with 100 people. . . Restaurant max for 20, which means queues for tables and food. . . The food was very average and small. For that the prices of meals from the cardboard at the 5 star hotel, really expensive. . . Same with the spa. A small pool, even smaller jacuzzi and a crowd of people everywhere. No rest. Fact, maybe nice service, but I drove 'em to rest and not push into the pool. Everything looks nice, but as usual in the pictures."
856,"I just got back from a visit, and she's in Medicover. I have an appointment with her because the pediatrician we usually go to is on holiday. The son is 5 years old. The doctor was dry and did not make contact with the child. I came to her with a non-standard cough. The son was listened to, but the doctor did not check neither ears nor nose. Having a comparison with other doctors (and my son has infections at least once every 2 months), I do not recommend the doctor because of the superficiality of the examination and the rude behaviour."
857,"Very nice hotel. Looks pretty new. I'll lose weight in the lobby, and the corridors. Clean and cool rooms. Bathroom's clean. No fungus and shit. You can see it's fresh and tidy. Hotel located in the Victoria shopping center. Seems helpful. And 1 km from the market. Just for a walk. The service is very nice and helpful. The hotel has a very small monitored parking. Probably for 10 cars. Other guests can park in the center. The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the restaurant opens its kitchens only at 4 p.m. Guests are doomed to lunch in the mall. There are not enough places to eat in the city . The manager can also think of a small shop for the forgotten. It's about toothpaste, medicines, etc."
858,"We highly recommend. My daughter had acute ear inflammation, no medication prescribed by the previous doctor helped, and Dr. Brown. Tretiakow prescribed appropriate medications and the next day the daughter stopped complaining about the earache and the next night slept peacefully without pain and fever. Great approach to children . The daughter was healthy and, above all, trusted you, Dr. Tretiakow. Thank you for your help and for sure if the situation would happen again (hopefully not :)) we will treat only with this doctor. I hope there will be more such doctors. Greetings"
859,"The hotel is ok from outside. . . and that's it, another plus is the location away from the hustle and bustle, by the lake, good food I recommend. Dinner was composed of three dishes - soup, potatoes, buckwheat groats, fish, pork neck and the best pancakes with strawberries: ) . When you cross the hotel thresholds, the spell is splashing. Heavy, depressing perseverance, dominating gold railings, overflow, marbles, red carpets and red wallpaper. The room smelled like cigarettes, the toilet smelled bad, the wardrobe smelled like dirty glasses from previous guests. Big objections to the staff, reception desk not organized, unprofessionally dressed. 4 stars is too much."
860,"Accommodation below any 80s standard, dirty, the owner rents DW for group trips, the old house should not be allowed to use. Tragedy, clogged washbasin, cigarette butts on the windowsill, carpet on the floor has not seen the cleaning for several years, the door cannot be locked because they are probably 50 years old, hot water for hours. 23 apparently everyone should be lying in their beds at this hour. Only windows are replaced with new ones and the rest looks like they did 50 years ago. This is the opinion I received about coming back from other groups, even the new building is no revelation, old furniture and not very clean. The reviews that are on the hotel website are probably the owners themselves wrote. The only advantage is the distance to the sea. I will never come back here again, nor will I recommend to anyone to rest in this DW"
861,"Sonia Village Hotel Greece HalkidikiGodzina 18 : 00 let 'em play music on the terrace of their room with a portable speaker, so with a portable speaker not with a disco speaker. After 10 minutes, the ""manager"" of this hotel ran out to me and ordered the music off. He asked 'em why nobody bothers anyone. He said that I have to turn it off because that's the rules. He told 'em that it's not nighttime silence. He said if I didn't turn it off, he'd call the police. He turned 'em off. After about an hour during dinner, I was asked to go to a separate room where the police were waiting for me to my surprise. . . . . I ended up with a reminder and a nice conversation. People, make this post as accessible as possible. This manager is a sick man. Tragedy. I'm enclosing some more photos from the bathroom in my room in the "" 4 * "" hotel. You can see for yourself. The service is very nice but the ""manager"" is a farce. . . Trip all inclusive after 23 you have to pay for a glass of wine. You can't even buy ice cream for a room right away you have to fly for money. The keys welded to the card just to not leave the air conditioning on. Feel all the current savings . . . . . I don't recommend this place! ! !"
862,"""Before we can develop an effective marker to test only one particular enzyme, we first need to know its catalytic preferences - the so-called substrate specificity"" - explains the project manager, dr hab . Marcin Dr . Existing tools for complex profiling of proteolytic enzymes were based on using only natural amino acids present in proteins. In order to achieve better results, the Wrocław team of dr . Drąg's Wrocław team has used unnatural amino acids, which are not encoded by DNA and are mostly formed by organic synthesis. A hybrid (containing natural and unnatural amino acids) fluorogenic substrate library (HyCoSuL) was created. ""With this tool we are able to create new, more sensitive substrates and chemical markers for a very large group of proteolytic enzymes,"" explained Dr. Bar."
863,Good doctor. He is fast but if he does his job well I think he is worth his price despite 10 minutes of visit: ) I'm satisfied. I am pregnant and thanks to your doctor's care I feel good and have no problems with hormones : D I recommend : D
864,she was 9 months pregnant with a rash all over her body. . . . . .the doctor didn't even get up to take a better look. He barely even took a look. . . . . .he just wrote me the vitamin ointment and goodbye. . . The rash put me in the hospital for two weeks until I gave birth. It's very difficult to see the cost of the visit.
865,"The hotel is a little bit overgrown. The lobby, bar and restaurant OK . Renovated, but the rooms ask for a change of decoration. And the bathrooms in particular ! Service either uncontacted or too much - including the customer's rugging that he doesn't know something. The parking lot and entrance to the hotel ( ! ? ? ) are not marked."
866,"I picked 'em up after reading the reviews on this portal. After hearing what I had to say, the doctor made a diagnosis - stress . The strange thing is that the diagnosis was made without ordering basic tests, without looking at the CT result. ( which he submitted to em on his desk ) Gives a NEUTHER opinion because it neither helped nor harmed me."
867,"I went to Dr. Beata for the removal of loyal warts ( called seniors ! ! and they showed up ok. 30r . with . For a woman it's a nightmare, my aunt is as big as a troll toad and I CAN't look like that in a couple of years. After my dead body! ) - Super effects . after electrocoagulation the small and medium ones disappear without return and with the growing new ones are three walkers. . . my nightmare was a jowl or a geck, as the daughters say. and with that I went for a consultation, it turned out that you can eliminate it with botox. I was persuaded to use a lightweight botox not only on the ""geck"" but also the forehead/eyes, done as necessary, lightly, naturally. And the effects of the revelation - I've lost 10, I'm blooming and everyone says I've been on a good vacation and I look great. And they ask where it was: ) ) ) Of course, I also put a hairdresser in the botox and a cosmetic facial cleansing + a decent pedicure: ) ) ) ) ) but the effect has surpassed my expectations and that's the most important thing. A balanced botox can be recommended, with me without side effects as yet. . . greetings to Eve W."
868,"Hotel at 5 , family stay all inclusive could not be more successful. Marianne is a quiet quiet place, very clean! Rooms renovated . Every day changed towels, linen every two days. Very good food and everyone found something for themselves, big plus for mules, shrimp and fish. Nobody expected the glass terraces and gold on the walls: D alcohol is known that it is not the highest shelf, but it is enough to have a good time and in the heat of the day you do not cut your feet. The hotel guests are focused on recreation and sightseeing. The only animation is a Greek evening every two weeks. Cool helpful staff . We recommend a holiday where we lie with our bellybutton up and it is a real idyll."
869,"Weekend stay in August 2016 with a 4-year-old wife and child 320 PLN for two nights with breakfast. Expensively for the standard of a hostel with microscopic, un-equipped rooms. A bunk bed in a dirty mattress, linoleum on the floor, two wooden stools. claustrophobic metre - standard of a medium equipped penal facility cell . The bathroom is given as an advantage - fact, it is, but average, you can see for a long time not refreshed. They advertise as a place to stay in the mountains - and this is the best review - it is certainly not a hotel or a boarding house, after a hike or a day spent on the slope, just drink 200 g of distillate and somehow it will last until the morning: ) For families with children - I advise against it. For this price you can find at least a good guesthouse."
870,"It looks cool and even works. . . ...until it breaks down. . . . .what happens. . . And once it breaks down, don't return it to the service, just report it and claim your money back! The service procedure is VERY long! ! Read on the internet and on the FB before you make a mistake ! I think that in this respect the company really has no respect for the customer. It started with the fact that the shipment went to service for 13 days because they chose this carrier. . . . .but that was just the beginning! I won't tell you how long the repair will take because in total I'm approaching 1 or 5 months and the laptop still hasn't seen em ."
872,"The number of stars does not match the standard offered ! Hotel under construction, no lifts, heating and air conditioning in the rooms, no room service - no one cleans the room. Aesthetics remains much to be desired, the staff can not cope even with a small number of guests."
873,"I got to see a doctor with very unusual symptoms. I value her for her insight, approach, respect. Since my case is unspecific, we were circulating around bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. The medication prescribed by the doctor helped considerably. Since for some time Dr. Szuber stopped working for luxmed and went to another doctor, we did the gastrology and it was he who reached the correct diagnosis, I am sure that Dr. Szuber would also make the correct diagnosis. Dr. Szuber is a great doctor, I highly recommend!"
874,"Vice-Rector for Science of the City of Łódź, prof . Lucyna Woźniak pointed out that the consortium provides additional opportunities to apply for funds in Horizon 2020 scientific and research projects. ""In this perspective, scientific projects without an industrial partner are much less likely to have a chance because the EU demands that public money should be spent not only on the development of science, but also on improving the well-being of Europeans"" - she stressed . In the opinion of the Vice-Rector, projects created at the interface between the partnership of research and development centres and industry have a chance to receive tens of millions of zlotys of funding, while scientific research alone can count on support of several hundred thousand zlotys. ""It is so important to shorten the road between research and its implementation"" - she added ."
875,"An unusual way of developing space . Projections on monitors, the way of opening the room, interior design, lighting composition and many others give a really unusual impression. Although the functionality is sometimes different (e.g. square toilet bowls...). The staff is very careful to ensure that the reception of the hotel is at an appropriate level. For me - without any problems. Fantastic breakfasts . And all in all, it is quite an intimate place, there are even several parking spaces in front of the building."
876,The offer does not match the description in the offer . NO PLACE . . . Approximately 7km from the hotel. Food Without Taste . The reception desk was pouring us in. Just one of the bartenders in order. I don't recommend it to anyone. . . ! ! ! ! ! 10 The people who were with us are complaining about WEIR. . . Because we flew in with him. . . Greetings and I discourage you! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
877,"The hotel is located in a total remote area, 1.5 km from the beach (it rides until 13. 40), so in the afternoon you go on foot 1.5 km up the mountain. To the port - the same situation - you go back 1,5 km up the mountain. Forget about walking on the promenade or visiting some shops. If you want to spend a week without going anywhere, it's okay - you'll love it. Luckily, we've rented a car, unfortunately for a large amount. The cheaper one could be rented at Malaga airport but what if the taxi to Malaga costs 100 euros! And if you want to go there, the public transport is about 3 hours in 1 page. Another thing is that the hotel is typically Spanish, practically nobody speaks English (maybe 1 or 2 people from the reception desk have something to say but it's hard to communicate if you have a specific matter or problem to solve. the waiters in the restaurant don't understand if you want SMALL COLA or BIG COLA: (total boredom in the evening. . all for children and only in Spanish. o 23 . 30 is enough to go to your room and go to sleep. Another thing is that you will not go on any optional tours. . . . .because they're just not available because of the location! Unfortunately, no one informed us about this before departure (and we received an offer of these tours a few days before departure! ) I believe that this hotel should not be sold to guests from outside Spain because it is simply not completely suitable for foreign guests who do not speak Spanish! She would never have chosen this hotel in her life if she had known all this when buying it (she did it to me on the internet; she only read a few reviews because there were no others). I do not recommend ! It is better to pay a few hundred zloty and buy a hotel in the Torremolines! ! ! The advantages of the hotel: * pretty cool swimming pools ( though crowded ) * good food, lots of seafood * reasonable price ( last minute )"
878,"The team headed by Professor Marek Naruszewicz, head of the Department of Pharmacognosy and Molecular Basics of Phytotherapy at the WUM, was the first in the world to demonstrate that oleacein found in olive oil (only extra vergine type) has a unique ability to prevent atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which can prevent, among others, heart attack and stroke. Numerous epidemiological studies indicate that the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease and cancer in the Mediterranean is much lower than in other European countries. This is related to diet - especially the consumption of olive oil. Daily consumption of 40 millilitres of olive oil reduces mortality from heart disease by 40%. and other diseases reduce mortality from heart disease by 30%."
879,"A study carried out by IŻ in several provinces shows that overweight is a problem for as many as 17-19% of Polish nine-year-olds, while obesity affects 6.5% of boys and 4% of girls of that age. Other studies confirm that the problem is growing in Poland, with overweight and obesity affecting 22% of children in total. ""We are starting to chase the leading Europe,"" warned the director of IŻŻ, Professor Mirosław Jarosz at the conference. ""The activities carried out in Europe so far, related to obesity prevention, have not brought the desired results,"" he added . According to dieticians' recommendations, children should eat five balanced meals a day. The practice is different - not all children eat breakfast at home, not all of them have a school dinner. Spending 5-8 hours a day at school, they should have two meals there,"" said professor. Jadwiga Charzewska from IŻ."
880,"He removed Mommy's breast. No follow-up treatment. Periodic examinations - only mammography . After 5 years, Mom was declared healthy . Because the right period passed and the second breast was clean. A month later it turned out that Mommy had metastases to her spine and abdominal cavity. After all, it is well known that breast cancer can metastasize and it should probably be somehow controlled by tests. How can a person with advanced cancer be considered healthy?"
881,"Hotel nasty and dirty with no elevators working every now and then Dirty rooms with dirty bathrooms . Uncomfortable and narrow beds . Full "" acoustics "" with the possibility of hearing the neighbor snoring from behind the wall . Terrible breakfasts with a spoonful of coffee and no choice and one waitress who can hide from guests. Advantages: you can within 200 m from the hotel ""hunt"" a place to park on the street (the hotel has its own parking lot, but if you arrive later, you can not count on a free space). Vilnius metro station is close by."
882,"I went to see a doctor with nasal septal problems. After a few visits I underwent surgery at the Hospital of St. John of God in Cracow, of course for a fee of 10000,00 PLN. After the wounds healed, after a few weeks it turned out that there is no improvement. He performed a private MRI examination in a military hospital, which was recorded on a CD with the description of the doctor. From the description it was clear, in short it is bad, the constriction making it harder to breathe. I went to see 'em and what a surprise it was for me, the doctor looking at my nose, he couldn't brag to himself how well he did, what a big airflow, first class. At this point he gave 'em a record with his opinion. After seeing and reading it, he found that he disagreed with the opinion. He told em the doctor that there is a tragedy and there is no improvement at all still through the nose I am not breathing . He asked em for a refund, the answer was short. Refusal. Everyone wanted to work to make money and not take any responsibility for their work I definitely do not recommend . Patient"
883,"Beautiful pictures of the rooms and low price encourages, however, it is completely different on the spot! ! ! Mould in the bathroom, stains on carpets, falling wallpaper, a lot of damaged equipment! ! ! ""0 "" stars !"
884,"The location is good, but the service to clean the rooms is probably by chance. Once the room was cleaned the next time nothing was touched. The simple expressions of maids such as ""God forbid"" and ""I think I'm about to die"" and commenting on the guest's lifestyle is unacceptable, especially when it is done out loud in the hallway. I'm very disappointed. . ."
885,"When asked or not, it is very easy to share your opinion, especially when using the internet. We forget about this, not using it to promote other restaurant services. We have a lot of guests who can potentially help us with their opinions, even on reviewing portals. In this context I have always been surprised by the building of a hotel restaurant brand with the main card. For which it is necessary to hire a recognizable, or at least experienced chef. Later on it turns out that such a restaurant shines empty despite a large number of sleeping guests. Not to mention the people from outside. And in the best case it does not arouse as much interest as was forecasted in connection with the invested resources."
886,"It was the first time that I encountered the fact that in fact the guesthouse is nicer than in the pictures. Clean, comfortable rooms, delicious food and very nice service. The guesthouse is located in the center of Białka, so it is close to everywhere. There are still nice memories left, I recommend to everyone!"
887,"This is not a luxury hotel. Modest. Rather a three-star hotel is divided into a newer part with a main building and a large swimming pool with loud music and an old part with two low buildings more dilapidated but relatively clean. For us, the advantage of the old part - where we lived was the proximity to a smaller and quiet swimming pool where you could easily arrange a reservation at 5 am and about 60 meters to the sea for those willing to swim in the salt : - ) Eating the biggest plus of this place. Lots and even diversified, local. Drinks in plastics but very friendly and large. Cocktails made from the heart and whatever you wanted (of course without black J Walker, etc.) Tuborg beer - better than our pee like lech or tyskie etc . Near the hotel bazaar and shops where you can buy clothes and souvenirs at good prices. Close to the town of Osdere where there is a large bazaar and some nightlife. You can go by bush for 2,50 lira. The boutiques are running every few moments - a great adventure. I recommend a trip to Efes. You can dive by the bird island but expensive and short. Near the hotel by the beach shisha bar. People very kind and smiling. They take everything at ease. Unlike the Egyptians do not reach out for tips at every turn. A big minus from me for a dysfunctional fitness room. The treadmills are broken . . . . Wifi works with breaks and only in the lobby of the main building and the canteen. I don't think so in the rooms."
889,"The fridge looks nice, capacious, shelves practically arranged, a bit too loud but goes to get used to and makes a bit different sounds from a traditional fridge but. . ...it just broke down after 2. 5 years, so if someone doesn't want to change the equipment every 2 years I don't recommend it, I don't know maybe we've got a bad model but in the shop agd they confirmed that the company was very much publicized and lost quality with the interest. It is better to spend a few more zloty and have peace of mind for a few years."
890,"The hotel I've been visiting before so it had a comparison to how it used to be and how it is now. Clean, the rooms are really good standard, the cleaning ladies don't even know when they cleaned the whole room every day and they did it perfectly. but unfortunately the pool area is already a bit worse. The sand in the children's paddling pool and the sediment on the walls of the pool - it probably shouldn't look like that. this time the spa wasn't used m - 5 years ago it was great. the smell of music treatments all at the highest level. Additional attractions: zoo and water safari - son was taken into the sky especially the lemurs entering our ship and posing for photos, sealarium also worth seeing. Everything is really good . but always must be some but . Breakfast in such a high-class hotel should be fresh and not be. You can see that some dishes were prepared earlier - dried cucumbers cut into slices is probably not the hotel's business card, just like the ""shiny"" mayonnaise on eggs. The restaurant service especially of ""foreign"" nationality is nice and extremely helpful so it should be everywhere but unfortunately the kitchen and the dishes 5 years ago were better. I recommend the place mainly to families with children. Many attractions for the little ones ."
891,"The potential of the place because of its proximity to the sea, nice beach, forest could create a wonderful place to relax. Unfortunately, the hotel itself leaves much to be desired, and guests can sometimes feel like intruders. A total lack of kindness and smile from the staff. On the contrary, the ground floor restaurant staff allow themselves to be noticed as in the school canteen. A visible lack of preparation for work in the gastronomy, a lack of a good manager or an inappropriate policy of the owners. Medium food . No desserts . The great disadvantage is also the lack of organized activities and games. A very minimalistic proposal! The game room in the basement closes at 22 . 00 . Prices of services from pseudo SPA are more expensive than in the capital. Simple rooms, but nice . Worse with cleaning . Rather selectively. The request to clean the room from Monday is answered on Thursday ."
892,"In rooms everywhere / even in bed biting ants FARAONA / . A safe paid in this class of hotel is a rare thing, as is the 20 EU towel deposit. Another interesting feature is the paid indoor swimming pool! Surely you can not complain about the boarding and service In my general opinion ONLY 4 stars would be to be received"
893,"Another very unsuccessful stay. This is definitely one of the most dirty hotels in Katowice, which is still under the rule of the People's Republic of Poland when it comes to room decoration. The rooms are dirty and dusty. Old wiped-out furniture, dirty pillows and a closed safe. The lamp in my room was broken and cracked. Even the handle in the window was dirty! The bathroom was a nightmare. Dirty fugues and a shower cubicle. The ceiling was all streaky. Old, worn out towels. The phone that was in the bathroom was not even connected. In addition, the smell of cigarettes, although the hotel is not smoking at night. The reception is very clumsy. Breakfast is far too expensive. I do not recommend!"
894,"I think a very weak doctor. The fact is that he takes a long time, talks, etc., but he seems to have no idea what he is talking about. When the patient is more inquisitive and not just blindly believing in the words of the doctor, he is not able to answer many questions or answers evasively. After the first visit I was found to be suspicious of Barret's esophagus. After the examination and analysis of the results by Dr. Ireneusz, I was directed to the Barret's esophagus by the HALO method (although the results of the examination clearly stated that I do not have Barret's esophagus). He consulted em with other doctors and professors from Gdansk, and he repeated the gastroscopy and once again examined em his esophagus. Everyone clearly stated that they were directed to a quite serious procedure, even though they could not help me in any way (only hurt me). It's like doing a colonoscopy of someone's throat for a sore throat - only with the possibility of worse side effects, because the surgery halo is ablation with electricity. The patient has no benefit from such a procedure - so who has it? ps . many doctors from Tri-City stated that Dr. Ireneusz is famous for abuse of his ""halo methods"" and directing his patients to the surgery in Hel."
895,"I've been to this hotel three times. Unfortunately, I think the owner or approach to the client has changed. The room is clean and well equipped but the restaurant is a complete failure. In the evening nothing can be eaten and breakfast is unfortunately also very bad. Coffee even though from the coffee machine is not to drink . The service is also poor . Before, there were ladies probably from Ukraine but they were very nice . Now, the Polish gentlemen, but as a punishment. I had a room above the restaurant so at 5 . 30 the end of sleeping because the door from the restaurant to the kitchen was hit. I am here for the last time."
896,"A kind and helpful doctor, open to patient's requests. Only they could be more contactable, more say more about the patient. Only they could have been more in touch with each other in case of doubt (which is said to be possible, but not during the visit) about the course and effects of the drugs. I have a generally positive opinion."
897,"The description and photos do not reflect the actual state of the hostel. . From the outside it looks nice but after entering the interior we were struck by literally smudge, as if this place has not been aired for the last 5 years. . . Minus: - the reception desk was still empty, it was hard to find someone like that - the wifi worked hopelessly despite the router in the hallway. . - stinking towels - dirty bedding - mushroom on the wall - mushroom in the bathroom - huge cracks under the door to the room which limited privacy and made you hear everything that was happening behind the door, also about a peaceful dream you can forget - not fully working lightening the room - general dirt and grime! ! There are no advantages. . ... maybe the location because to the old town even close, but it still did not compensate for the conditions offered by the hostel. ."
898,"Two weeks after the eye correction, it doesn't look good. I think it will be necessary to correct it especially that I am pulled by the very outer corners of the eyes - you can see the skin stretched over the eye and the inner corners have become asymmetrical, besides you can see the scars from the stretch marks of the suture. I will wait up to six weeks - maybe there will be an improvement - and then I will raise the doctor's grade."
899,"They rented us a room for two people for one night. We were pleasantly surprised when we noticed that the inside was clean and quite modern. Breakfast served in the form of a Swedish buffet is tasty but rather standard. The location is also very good, the walk to the centre is about 15 minutes. The service is nice and friendly. The only downside is that there is a lot of traffic on the streets, which makes it difficult to fall asleep. For us five of the minus."
900,"The manor house is located in a very charming place, but guests should be ready for a few inconveniences. My observations below : 1 . the access road is typically forest (a hole in the hole), 2 . the lady from the reception is very difficult to locate, 3 . the reception is not open 24 hours a day (as it is shown on the page), 4 . in one of the rooms was cold and despite several times paying attention, nothing was done about it. You can't drop it on the old walls because in the room on the other side of the corridor it was warm and pleasant, 5 . in the bowling alley the belt for transporting the balls was still jammed and the balls had to be pulled out of it with our hands, 6 . dinner: tomato with rice (very decent) and fries + chicken breast in a coat also with fries - amount of fat terrifying. However, what I did not like the most was the fact that we were invited from the SPA building at 21 : 05 although theoretically it should be open until 22 . Why? Because the ladies at the reception wanted to go to sleep. The advantages: 1 . location, 2 . very nice ladies from the restaurant, 3 . lovely cats, 4 . bath in balls."
901,"A very nice lady who has a lot of knowledge and knows how to apply it in practice. . . . You can always ask her something in class if you don't know, and Dr. Zoń will certainly help. . . . I recommend it!"
902,"A hotel where, before you think of anything, it is: ) Beautiful, very spacious and comfortable rooms with a large balcony, very well equipped, large bathroom, cosmic comfortable beds with thick mattresses. Amazing food, will satisfy everyone, even the most difficult taste. The water park on site, many attractions, you can swim in the outdoor pool even in winter. Recently, right next to the hotel, a ski slope with a lift. And to this almost invisible, but ubiquitous, effective and friendly service, which is the crowning achievement of all efforts for every guest. Really six points out of five possible!"
903,We received a room in the basement which is definitely below the standards we are used to - there was no information during the reservation that this is a room with a reduced standard - for us the basement is such a reduced standard. Pistoning (no free tables at breakfast). The surroundings is an advantage - but the weather was bad so we have this gloomy room with a small TV set. Clean - but the basement is a basement and that's it.
904,"She's nice as a human being, as an andrologist - a total mistake. On my husband's third visit, she spread her hands and said she didn't know what to do with the worse and worse results. I advise you to look for a real andrologist and not someone who, as an endocrinologist, has ""added"" another specialty!"
906,"Hotel with very good food, once you get there and you can accept the limited range of ""PLUSA"" it is an ideal place for training. It is located in a very picturesque place. A great bass and spa. The possibility of renting a motorboat is an additional attraction. The dining room with a glass floor overlooking the bass wakes up in the morning."
907,"I definitely do not recommend! ! ! No. . . . .unless someone / like us / wants to be effectively cured from holidays in Turkey? ? ? ! ! !

908,"The worst 3-star hotel in which she stayed in the Italian Alps . 1 / no TV in the TV Room; 2 / old / worn out carpets everywhere; 3 / in the bar old, dirty sofas with holes; 4 / in the restaurant tablecloths from the cape; 5 / photos on the web - site probably 10 years ago; 6 / monotonous breakfasts, e.g. one type of cheap yellow cheese, ham-like products; scrambled eggs are a mixture of eggs, milk and flour, no fresh fruit; 7 / dinners not very much reminiscent of Italian cuisine, repeated dishes such as . One day rissotto, another day pasta with the same sauce; 8 / incompatibility with the offer on the website: sauna does not work, fitness also not; 9 / the only plus is a very nice service in the restaurant and room service; 10 / the chef - supposedly the owner is unpleasant and arrogant."

Avoid like fire! ! !"
910,"Analysis 1 , 2 lectures I do not recommend [ / b ] I liked this gentleman on average. The lectures were Monday night fine, it was well crowded, but with credit, quite a few people had problems. Personally, I made a big mistake and broke down Gorniak - I did not go to the lectures, and I did not have practice with him, and this ended up in the exam not on 3 - the doc has a difficult grading system either 0 or 1 and the points do not give for free. I wanted to finish the course with him as soon as possible and I have to admit that this was my greatest motivation not to meet him in class next year. Besides, the doctor often relies on old-fashioned types and attaches to some students. He went through some of them and it was awfully uncool: (He discouraged some people. . . . .and that's just a shame. That man doesn't motivate, that man WKURZ. Advice? Don't overeat GORNIAK and don't fall for it. ( He's really dangerous. . . . ) : P"
911,"Large apartments, clean and well equipped kitchen. The only downside may be the windmills, which in early June proved to work, but I can not imagine the summer fully without air conditioning. Spacious balconies with a side view of the ocean. I recommend rooms from the garden side. To the beach about 300 m . To the nearest shop 10 - 15 min . on foot . It is good to rent a car and visit the beautiful beaches in the south-western part of the country and the westernmost part of Europe . And when it comes to food, we did not use the food, friends were on HB and praised each other."
912,"The hotel is only for Spanish, German and English teenagers looking for entertainment and it's literally an amazing scream. Throwing out of balconies, chairs, bottles of cans, etc. . Information for the Poles, if you find yourself in this hotel, please ask the hotel not at the main reception but the one on the hill, the staff do not react to anything, in their opinion so they can scream and disturb no matter what, there is no nighttime silence in this hotel! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . . We are not demanding people, but this is the first time we have encountered such terrible conditions for two weeks of zero sleep, of course, at night Full-length music and it is different from every room we do NOT recommend! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
913,"We came in November 2016 for 5 days with All inclusive. Accommodation = dirt, humidity, vermin, toilet busting, musty, no normal bedding. The beds were in such a terrible condition that we did not sleep in them. . In the living room with a broken couch and an open kitchen and bedroom there was the stench of steaks. Stinky blankets. All inc is a parody. A choice of low alcoholic beverages including 25 % vodka. Eating despite alleged European days monotonous . Great location, two steps from the ocean . Unsleepy did not rest 'em ."
914,"The biggest advantage of the hotel is definitely its location, in the city centre with a private beach opposite the hotel. The hotel and the rooms are clean and impeccable, the towels are changed daily, the floors are washed, the bathroom and the balcony. Large room with fridge safe and wonderful sea view! The hotel also provides animation for guests (even in low season). The food is very good, fresh, mainly European cuisine, but local delicacies are also available. The service is very friendly and helpful. The hotel's spa including hamman new, clean, also worth recommending. We had our stay in the last week of April and I dare to recommend this date. The weather was perfect, no precipitation and temperatures from 23 - 30 degrees. Also at this time, all the plants and flowers bloom, the smell and the view is wonderful! Alanya is a wonderful city, fabulous landscapes, beautiful beaches, warm sea (even in April) and nice people. We will definitely come back in the autumn!"
915,"For a 2os clinic + an extra bed on the couch 250 PLN with breakfasts is cheap for Krakow. Only that far away from the center, the hotel is for good * * stars deserves but not for four, in the room an allergy sufferer will suffocate and healthy will get asthma from the dust which is inclusive and will feel like a prisoner. You get claustrophobic. One to two nights to endure but with a heart ache. Breakfast is edible only."
916,"A very charming place, surrounded by nature itself and so literally. We had a very nice and spacious room. Whereas in the bathroom the shower was leaking. I think that we should somehow solve this issue to avoid some loss. It was quite uncomfortable to go out of the shower and enter the puddles at once. Breakfast too, I think it's modest as for this price because you could think of something more creative than what you can get in a chain store. But it wasn't the worst. The whole thing is at 4!"
917,"Greetings! ! ! I ask everyone to help me find Prof . Szczylik , and especially to Mrs. Ula because my Mom was affected by the same melanoma . As far as I know, Dr. Szczylik is currently on vacation at the Szaserów Hospital, but maybe you can find him somewhere private."
918,"We are currently staying at the hotel. Compared to last year, it is worse - the manager has changed. Breakfast + supper = stand in the KOLLECKS for coffee / drinks (seriously, people take pictures of themselves) - to handle hundreds of people is one boiler with boiling water + one machine (the other broken), + one distributor for water / juice (the choice is huge because we can dress up as much as we like in orange or apple juice - it is crazy) . There is no tea for supper because ""now the hotels are leaving it"", also devoid of any warm drink (at the coffee machine a piece of paper that coffee can be BEST in the bar) in the evening we pour cold glasses of orange juice from concentrate (last year there were juices from cartons). For breakfasts every day the same - scrambled eggs in one piece + the cheapest sausage + mushrooms begging for mercy. In addition, something cold - everything so fucked up that it is impossible to eat. Dinner salads - sauerkraut (with pepper), lettuce (without dressing), pride! No cameras even at the children's playroom, where kids leave their shoes (our ""something"" has found a new owner ...) Parking lot partly lined with ankle, partly riding on hardened gravel with a variety of LOUDs (parking for better and worse) . Children's kitchen - REDUCED and HARD vegetables, meat seasoned mainly with pepper. The center like another, the kitchen saved it, now it will not defend itself. PS . Dishes also do not knock down cleanliness."
919,"The Renaissance Hotel, which is being built opposite Terminal 2 at Okęcie Airport in Warsaw, next to the Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, which has been operating since 2003, is now perfectly visible. From underneath the scaffolding also emerges the façade of the building, which should receive its first guests in the second half of 2013. The five-star building will have 225 rooms, 5 meeting rooms, restaurants and a bar, as well as a swimming pool, fitness centre and spa. The main investor, which will cost 141 million PLN, is P . P ."
920,"Visits are very short, but in fact, it tells what the prospects are for people. He was the first one to make a visit reimbursed by the NFZ to put himself in the shoes of the grandmother, he did not fail to take the symptoms even though his predecessor did it. To sum up, it confirmed what the previous doctor stated in 20%, namely that if it does not hurt there is no point in moving. The rest of the ventricular failure of that doctor. Thanks to Dr. Nalewajko the man knows what to do to stop the progression of the disease, thanks to the commissioned diagnostics, a new other ailment was caught in the initial phase, which does not give symptoms at this stage. At the end of the examination he tells his canticle about the disease in a measure of exactly how the man wants to know something to make sure he asks quietly, without any nerves, he dispels the doubts. To sum up the whole visit of one patient about 5 minutes but you can really learn more at this visit than after 20 minutes with others."
921,"The first consultation visit lasted 6 minutes. We were received with a 17-minute delay. Preliminary express interview ; - ) but I was under the impression that the Doctor's answers were less interesting. He did a thyroid ultrasound. Probably a good specialist reading other patients' opinions. However, after our express visit, my impressions are really mixed."
922,"A hotel in a very good place, you can't take it away from him. Lobby very nice, modern, the same goes for the restaurant. The problem arises when you enter the room. Tight clutches, a lot of dust, night not sleeping through the cold. As far as service is concerned, I fill in the online check - in and online check - out, so that as soon as possible it all goes through. Nevertheless, checking out as well as checking in took me 20~30 minutes each. If it wasn't for the fact that I told em to a woman that all the data I already have, because I am a regular Le Accor customer and I filled out an online form would go step by step everything . I wouldn't be grumbling if I hadn't paid 450 pln/night for all this. For this price you need a little more."
923,"""The principle of operation is that if a man wants to have intercourse and his partner is also ready for it, he presses the pump in the scrotum bag through the skin several times and the liquid from the tank in the abdomen flows into the cylinders in the cavernous bodies. An erection occurs, which can last as long as the patient and his partner wish. There is a normal ejaculation, that is ejaculation, there is a normal orgasm"" - explained Dr Marcin Życzkowski . ""It is an effective solution, valuable especially in young people, where inability to live together is a drama. Of course, it is applied after using all other possibilities. It is a surgical procedure . As any such procedure can bring the problem of complications and damage to the mechanism itself, because it is a mechanical thing, it can break down"" - said prof . The parade ."
924,"Hotel in the category of quality / price really gives you a tip - accommodation in Wroclaw for 39 PLN is something. However, you have to admit openly that the rooms are not for everyone, and their specific construction - with an open glass bathroom, sink outside and a separate toilet is certainly suitable for one person or for a couple with a large seniority, and not for a romantic trip ; ) The rooms are small and clean, although it would be useful to wash the carpet. WIFI in the room works fine. The location of our room (right next to the elevator) caused that unfortunately we could hear all the people coming and going. From the hotel it is easy to get to the center by tram, it only takes 30 minutes."
925,"This was your first visit to the doctor. You looked at your son very carefully from head to toe, which was a big positive surprise, but less often you focused on the skin changes themselves. Maybe it was because she immediately found out what was wrong with her son. The doctor is a very factual person, open to conversation, she explained, answered questions and was also very nice. I think that this doctor is worthy of recommendation."
926,"A unique decoration, mixing rococo with ... . You'll see, you'll understand why she didn't finish the m. Large mirrors in gold frames in the room, in the bathroom mirrors even on the ceiling. A large, comfortable bed, a room quite spacious. My unfortunately had little daylight. I was missing a kettle in the room, there is only water in the bottle. Wifi is available in the rooms. It was 3 nights, the cleaning lady wasn't making any effort. She was once to take a towel and empty the basket. She didn't want to do it anymore. The food was eaten by herself, she got a broth - Chinese soup - to greet her. Dill was sprinkled with dill to pretend to be homemade. The hotel has a convenient location, easy to reach from the station, if by car, it is quite close to the S8; 5 min. walk and there is a shopping center. The service at the hotel is nice and you can see that the girls are trying. Generally I do not regret if I have to choose the Black Cat and Iris, then I prefer this Cat."
928,"Single room for 4 days . Small with bathroom . In the room there is a TV set, desk, bed, wardrobe, large mirror and a bathroom with shower. Breakfast good: coffee brewed what is important in the morning or soluble if you prefer or juice or tea. Rolls, light and dark bread, butter, jams, cheese, cold cuts, hot sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, white cottage cheese, flakes with milk and yoghurt. I did not come out of the canteen hungry. Very nice service. Tiny towels, I recommend to have your bath. Fresh linen. The only thing I missed was cleaning and emptying the trash, and for 4 days, a little bit has gathered up. I'll be back there."
929,"I don't understand the admiration of the doctor at all. First of all, traditionally over an hour late. Secondly, the treatment of the child in question and the price for the visit is high. Thirdly, the arrangement of your private phone calls during the visit . At the end of the day, the doctor's son probably got into the office and he was so busy talking to him that he didn't even answer goodbye. For 150 zloty it would have been done. . . ."
930,"Hotel service very nice and very helpful, conditions according to photos and opinion of other vacationers, the hotel is clean, modest, quiet, quiet, under the hotel a small market - rather a shop with basic products, a little further a large market Constantinos with a large selection of everything, ok. 800 m access to the sea, pleasant road between hotels and palm trees, sandy beach, not crowded, sun beds 3 Euros, convenient connection to the center of Kos City and other places. Recommended !"
931,"Opinion on the basis of electronic course [ lecture ] On the faculty: W - 12 WEMiF lectures are of little use, because they are asked too quickly and too chaotic to 9 lectures you can learn from the notes prepared for the lectures by Mrs. Dr. . Since the 10th lecture, you can either pray for the message, or look for someone to understand the colloquia if you fail this corrective colloquia often, they are said to check who attended the classes and reflect the general level of knowledge not very much a nice person who does not know why no one can understand the measures is not so tragic, but it is also good the course of the semester: 1 - a series of colloquiums - about 50% of people passed 2 - a giant colloquium - 15 people out of 120 1 - a set of correcting colloquiums: the total number of people finishing the course by this point is about . 50 out of 120 2 ( last ) - from the 14.02 correctional terms ( : ( tragedy that I had to wait for this) . There were 5 people there. So many numbers, and now the naked truth: D The first circle can be easily and without any problems counted as a little bit of learning and understanding the basics. The second one is to know better someone wise who would put it on the understandable language of what is in the notes. You can also take a picture. Just like my friend said: ""Measure n"
932,"Getting to the hotel is currently an ordeal. The streets around the hotel are closed, and to enter the car park, you have to drive against the current into a forbidden alley. But you did and got 'em. Lobby - scares the emptiness and communist Poland. Booking a room tempted 'em to the highest class - superior. He got 'em a room on the 5th floor. A room of the right size. Clean . I was surprised by the air conditioner standing in it . Bathroom was big, not the first freshness. TV's old, but you could see something in it. WiFi free, but it worked. The advantage and all in all what I always pay attention to is the bed - very comfortable and allowing you to relax. Breakfast in the restaurant - poor is not a lot to say. Before 8 single pieces of cold cuts and cheese . But there were doughnuts available. The hotel actually has years of greatness behind it, it seems to me that a good host would give him the advice to bring it back again."
933,"Professionalism is the word that defines the Doctor. Nice service, but how for such an amount would I be surprised if it was different. Often a nice hour, you had to wait for example an hour for your turn - but that's a minus, I don't go to the doctor privately and I make an appointment for a specific hour to wait for a party over an hour. Over half a year she treated my acne, including there were three times changed drugs and my face is still the same as at the beginning."
934,"The previous opinion about the hotel deleted 'em, seeing the positive feedback, I told 'em that a few mistakes can happen to anyone, but as I see it, there are Guests who share my opinion, so WHEREAS: First of all, food - I strongly advise against it! ! Secondly: before buying accommodation I suggest to see how the rooms look like: in the picture it looks quite encouraging, and as far as reality is concerned - the rooms are very small, without attention to detail (finishing, cleaning) - which made us feel like in a poor hostel! ! There are carpets everywhere, which give the impression of an all-encompassing HEART even though it was not hot. And what is most interesting is the attitude of the staff to solving problems - it was the first time I encountered such reluctance (incompetence ?) ! ! I DETERMINED TO DISCLAIM, I even warn you! !"
935,"Hello, I've been undergoing treatment since the end of October. Very quickly responded to my concerns about the behavior of my person seeking help. She needed me not only pharmacological support, but the understanding of the other person, conversations and explanations, which will eventually allow me to accept myself, not to be afraid, to calm my inner anxiety. It was also valuable to meet with her spouse, Anna herself came up with this proposal, which helped a lot. What's important is that she doesn't only want to help with medicines, but also to solve the problem at source. As a result, that is a thing of the past. I look positively into the future. Mrs. Anna is not only a doctor but also a trustee of our concerns and problems, she is able to listen and feel the patient's problem, she gives a sense of security, I think it is her professional success, because this work is its fulfillment and we as patients benefit from it. I have great respect for what you are doing, I greet you very much :)"
936,"/ human / professor Pawlikowski is a physicist, I had 'em with him ' physical frontal humanist ' :) I don't know what the other frontal lenses look like in him. The lecture is very interesting. Interrupted by great jokes, anecdotes and stories. He can change the topic of the lecture if the room proposes something else. Excellent contact with the audience, his jokes and remarks quite often hit the representatives of the fair sex in the room. Sometimes the particular person. From a male point of view it's not rude, just funny, but a woman can sometimes feel the target of an 'attack'. The score: 3, 0 you have as in the bank. If you give a paper related even loosely to the content of any of the lectures (several pages) you have 5 , 0 . Sometimes and more : ) [ / b ]"
937,"She chose this place for a short holiday due to the availability of many attractions for children and in this respect she did not disappoint m - the garden is full of swings, trampolines, ladders, there is a shallow pool for children. One downside - the garden is not closed to the car park so a living child can at any time run out into the area where cars can theoretically move around. A small playroom but with many toys, children are happy. Rooms for me very poor, dark, gloomy, walls like paper, you can hear all the noises, especially those coming from the bathrooms, you sleep awful. And the biggest downside by which I would never recommend this place even for the inconsiderate customers - the bedding smells musty, as if it had never dried up, lying in the humidity for too long, it was hard for me to sleep in it. Service is weak, breakfast is fine, no fireworks. To sum up - it was in many modest places but they were cleaner and more pleasant. I'm not coming back and I don't recommend it."
938,"I don't recommend it. Mariusz S has already described everything. Everything is true. I'll add that Saranda is not worth a visit at all. Albanian food is not tasty, concrete blocks around, infrastructure not prepared for the number of tourists. I have a comparison with other Mediterranean countries and I have experienced great disappointment here. The only advantage of Albania is its prices. Twice as low as in Turkey or Greece. It's about the prices in restaurants, because shopping for clothes is a space. If you can afford a holiday in normal countries, avoid Albania with a wide gap."
939,"Further places are guest rooms ( 8 , 4% . ) , guest houses ( 8 , 1% . ) and agritourism farms ( 7 , 6% . ) . Among the 20 most sought-after destinations were popular seaside resorts such as Władysławowo, Mielno, Sopot, Międzyzdroje, Gdańsk, Świnoujście, Kołobrzeg, Łeba and Krynica Morska. TOP 20 also includes large urban agglomerations such as Warsaw and Wrocław. An interesting fact was the great popularity of small tourist complexes in Poland, such as Skorzecin, Boszkowo or Okuninka. These data partly coincide with a study conducted by eholiday.pl in May this year."
940,"The doctor smokes, but she never smoked in front of me. Maybe it used to happen to her, but now I don't think so. Once I came back to the office after the visit and found me smoking it, but with the window open. Besides, I think she's doing well as a doctor"
941,"Well, this hotel has actually 1 advantage: it is close to the centre, as well as a bus from/to the airport and main train/ metro station. The area is quite dirty. The hotel has 3 stars, but given probably a very long time ago and not verified, Max 1, 1, 5 is all. The decoration and furnishings of the rooms are the turn of the 1960s and 1970s, a comfortable bed. Clean bedding. The night lights are. No TV or radio in the room. The room needs to be renovated without delay - maybe it will, because in some parts of the hotel you can see that some work is going on, but... . . Hot water appears and disappears. . . A very loud fan... The towels ( rather old ) are clean; the soap and paper are. Breakfast buffet (buns, butter, naps, coffee, tea, juice) served in the restaurant on the 5th floor (if the elevator breaks down on Saturday, it was fixed only on Monday) with a terrace - you can have breakfast with a view of the city and its whores. Generally I don't break down, especially for longer stays. . ."
942,"What the professor says may be interesting and sometimes interesting, but the downside is how he says it. His voice is very monotonous and after 30 minutes of the lecture he thinks about either getting some sleep or going somewhere else. Everyone enrolled in a course has a 3.0 in the index immediately without going to any lecture, if you want to have a higher grade there is a colloquium in one of the last lectures. The professor does not say what kind of issues he is going to discuss, but he does say that if someone comes to this colloquium and does not write anything, or writes complete nonsense not related to the subject, he will fail him, but in my group such a thing did not happen, maybe because the colloquium was written by some 15 people from a 70-person group. . . The marks from the circle had a full spread from 3.5 to 5.0 in isolated cases."
943,"Cheap product . Allows for gentle stress relief and relaxation of emotional tension. Emotions are still felt during stress, however, the agent blocks the driving mechanism of the stressor, which discourages from going deeper into the stress factors, i.e. reduces susceptibility to stress. It is not a typical sedative, but a mild, herbal preparation. It will certainly help people who periodically struggle with everyday, more difficult stressful situations. It should be borne in mind that the preparation will probably not help in advanced depressive states, traumas and mental or nervous breakdowns. It makes it easier to sleep, so you can relax without feeling unsleepy. I recommend it to people who have temporary stressful situations and want to reduce their effects."
944,"When he saw me he thought I was too young to be sick. When she showed him the slides from the CT scan showing the tumor he would see (marked with arrows just in case) he thought that she should consult me again with another radiologist. I was told to do an EUS (for a biopsy) on him - before the examination, the doctor said that he hoped the NFZ would reimburse him for the cost of the examination. The examination should last about 1 - 1 , 5h , the doctor wrapped himself in 20 minutes. He said that everything looks perfect, he took 3 pictures because there was no more sense, there is no trace of tumor. When she asked me where my pain came from, he said that the causes of the pain could be different and he made it clear that I am one of those people who apparently like to get sick of something. She was happy that the tumor had disappeared, but fortunately my doctors did not let this diagnosis fool them. After another abdominal CT, other additional examinations and months of waiting landed me on the operating table where in addition to the removal of a large, hard as concrete tumor I had to resect the digestive tract in three places. The gastrointestinal tract was stiffened. . . As it turned out, the result of the CT scan contained the exact location of the tumor, which had been able to solidly press on the pancreas, duodenum and intestine. Congratulations to the doctor on his work, and to all patients I strongly advise against this doctor."
945,"I was also diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I made an appointment with the doctor at the ICZMP - a private visit, cost 100 PLN. I was treated as an intruder, the doctor answered my questions and did not advise me on anything (not even the diet, nor how often and at what time should I measure sugar). ...left me with the same fear and ignorance as before the visit. In the meantime, on a visit paid for by me, she answered the phone all the time. She appeared there because another diabetologist, who couldn't accept me, ordered me to go to the clinic or to go to the hospital immediately (weight loss, too much sugar). This doctor said that I could lose weight (and generally I am slim and gained little weight), and the sugar I have sometimes exceeded (as if I hadn't seen my results with a multiple meter measurement). In my notes from my diet for a few days and the value of sugar she just peeked at on the phone. When she asked me what value of sugar is supposed to bother me - answer: none, and what value of sugar means that I have to go to the hospital immediately - answer: none. All the time she felt as if she wanted to push me out of the office. I don't know what she paid me the 100 PLN for. I wish I had told her that."
947,"In room 5 there was a broken night lamp, an electric kettle with a broken cable, which had to be moved for it to work and someone did not clean the toilet after the last customers. She complained to me, the nice staff proposed room 4. It seems all right, but using a tap, shower or toilet, there is a noise as if somebody was demolishing the wall, plus an unpleasant smell. For a person with service, ""it's normal"". For me it's not very normal. Breakfast on what was served very expensive. Kitchenette with fridge in both rooms so you should take care of breakfast yourself. The biggest advantage is a pleasant, new, clean bedding. The rooms are large, nicely and well arranged. Good location ."
948,"She made an appointment for me because she was planning a VaserLipo treatment for my stomach and back. I am not an obese person, I wear size M / 38 and I rather see myself as a slim person with unevenly distributed fat - just around the abdomen and back. During the visit, the doctor was relaxing my figure when she was sitting on a chair and she found out that with my appearance I am rather qualified for an abdominal surgery (sic !), but she never gave birth to m , and sitting is difficult to find the lack of rollers . When she got up and undressed, I heard that I have a quote: ""mess on my back"". I have no waist or buttocks. I would add that she would describe her figure as an ""hourglass"" rather than an ""apple"", so I consider such terms to be calculated to drive the patient into even greater dissatisfaction with her own body and persuade her to extend the procedure to other areas. I'm not going back there."
949,"The four-day stay in this hotel was the second and certainly the last. Three years ago it was very decent, but now it's a terrible experience. After entering the room during the opening, the balcony window fell out 2m on 1, 5m was completely uncovered, interesting how to clean the room if such a trifle was not noticed. The room was of course changed for us to be just as nasty. For 4 days staying for 2 there was no hot water and the staff only claimed to do something about it. The food is the level of an average milk bar, basically hard to say unsavoury. Just tasteless. No possibility of ordering anything to the room, the bar is open until 10 pm. The rooms are pretty dirty, it's really not enough to vacuum off the bright carpet, the pets banging on the balcony. Wallpaper in a few places standing out from the wall. In front of the entrance to the hotel and in the parking lot, an ice rink. You can see a total lack of maintenance and investment in the facility."
950,"Shortened my stay in the hostel by two days due to the terrible conditions. The hostel refused, of course, to reimburse me for the days that I had already paid em and in which I wasn't there, which I informed the staff. The hostel charges hidden fees for many things, such as bedding we get for the price, but for the pillowcases to it you have to pay 3 € extra, which we will find out about at the reception. A room exposed to the sun was so hot that you could not stay in it in the afternoon. The reception desk doesn't have any medicines, it couldn't advise me where to buy them on Sunday nearby. The showers and toilets are claustrophobically small, 'bigger' people will have difficulty using them. There was a stove in the room, but there was nothing else in the room - a mug, a spoon, a plate, nothing just that. Everything has to be rented at the reception desk on the 4th floor below, of course for a fee. I do not recommend."
951,"That year the doctor was leading my pregnancy, she was satisfied because she was really nice. In 12 weeks of pregnancy she had a prenatal examination and it turned out that NT was above the norm (2, 9 at crl 68) without explaining anything to us, the doctor suggested amniocentesis and asked if I will undergo an apprenticeship if it turns out that the baby has downy syndrome. She knew that I wouldn't come back to your doctor. After a few days, she was on a visit to a specialist in fmf and NT 2 , 3 at crl 79 , i.e. she is in the standard. Doctor could have informed us? that even with 5 NT we have a 90% chance to give birth to a healthy child, instead of scaring us and suggesting appointments. Our son is healthy ? ? ? ? Agata"
952,"A beautifully situated hotel where you can fall asleep and wake up in the noise of the waves. Unfortunately, there is a theft on the premises. During our stay several rooms were robbed. Cameras and cash were mainly lost. Lack of any reaction from the hotel staff - the cases ended with police interventions. Some of the rooms are very nicely renovated. Every day cleaning . The food is quite average but you can eat to the full without any problems."
953,"The Doctor's very nice. However, the visit took place at an express pace (I don't know if everything lasted 3 minutes), so much so that it is difficult to ask about everything. Maybe it should still be the case with a visit within the NFZ, but rather not with a paid visit."
955,"The hotel is located on a scenic slope but far from the center of Szczyrk, unfortunately, the times of splendor are over. It is a typical conference facility, adapted for families with children. The rooms are varied, some with terraces, balconies and others without, standard rooms. The swimming pool and sauna complex with specific balcony decoration. Breakfast is standard in hotel category. The facility for people with little sophisticated culinary and aesthetic needs."
956,"If I'm to be honest, I went to your doctor because there was no room for my gynaecologist. . she came to me with a lack of menstruation, with an ultrasound she even pretended to me that she didn't need to come to me because if she had done a skillful pregnancy test she would have known that a lack of menstruation is a pregnancy. . . However, after a while she added that she doesn't know if it's for sure a pregnancy because it looks like either a 4-week embryo or an air bubble. And that's where the test ended. . On leaving the office the doctor added ""Do your pregnancy test, if it turns out to be positive it is a pregnancy and if it turns out to be negative it is an air bubble"". I'll add that on Good morning, when she entered the office, the doctor pulled out the phone and even though she had a patient for about 10 minutes she was talking on the phone."
957,"As long as I can remember, I've been tired of the ""bruises"" under my eyes. Before every time I left home I had to put a huge amount of concealer around my eyes to hide them. . . It was my trouble. Dr. Rzepnikowski recommended me a carboxytherapy treatment and light eyes ultra. Both treatments she repeated me several times and I must admit that the effects are great! I see a huge improvement . The skin around the eyes is brightened, and the ""bruises"" have practically disappeared. As for Dr. Rzepnikowski, he is a very nice and always smiling person. Before starting the treatment he will explain exactly what it is and what effects we can expect. I recommend Fabskin to everyone."
958,"The Doctor is a very nice woman, she explains everything and devotes as much time as she needs to the patient. She does not underestimate the patient, she asks for all the details. She is very gentle when examining, she is talked to without stress. The great advantage of Mrs. Dr. Dr. is that she realizes that not everyone can afford expensive treatment and refers her to the NFZ clinic for a thorough examination. She gives advice on where to go and to which other specialists for more advanced diseases. I strongly recommend the Doctor, especially for young girls who do not want to be neglected and do not want to destroy their health."
959,"I think he is a very good doctor, he makes good diagnoses according to the latest standards. You can talk to him calmly, he explains everything and devotes a lot of time to each patient. I have been treating Mr. Wincewicz for a year now. Previously I was treated in one of the Warsaw medical centres, where gynaecologists were tragic, they could only treat with medicines that did not help, and if they did colposcopy and it was not correct, it is best to cut everything out, not trying other methods and not asking whether the patient gave birth or not. I am very pleased with the Doctor, because he knows his stuff. You know you have to pay for all the tests, but I go to him with pleasure and pay even though I have a pass bought by the company in one of the medical centres in Warsaw. At least there is someone here who has time for me, and not like in the center 5 minutes and the next patient."
960,"Hello, Dr. Marcin seems to be a professional, he quickly recognized the problem (epididymitis) - but the antibiotics he prescribed did not cure me. After another visit one of the preparations from the first treatment was prescribed - but he did not help either. He told the doctor that in chronic colitis it is dangerous to give long series of antibiotics. In my case, it resulted in the exacerbation of colitis and the accompanying inflammation of the shoulder and ankle joints - I work as a physiotherapist so it interferes with my work . As for me, the therapy was not effective, the antibiotics failed, they did not help and worsened my health. Once again, I find out that after the first misguided antibiotic, the doctor should immediately order the culture. The doctor did not do it."
961,"Thanks to the program, guests of participating Starwood hotels in Europe, Africa and the Middle East have the opportunity to pay $1 (or equivalent in local currency) to their hotel bill as a donation to UNICEF. In addition, Starwood and UNICEF launched a fundraising campaign in 2008 called ""Road to Awareness"". Over the past 18 years, hotel guests and Starwood employees have collectively raised more than $30 million for UNICEF to improve the lives of children with special needs worldwide and to provide access to education. Earlier this year, Starwood introduced the Make a Green Choice program, which allows Starwood hotel guests around the world to opt out of daily cleaning services."

964,"Unfortunately, I'm not gonna show up with a good opinion. A private visit was based only on a superficial diagnosis of the doctor, he did not want to listen to what I have to say. So there was no dialogue between the patient and the doctor. He did not spend enough time and I have the impression that my problem was treated in a way, again I will use this word, superficial. Clearly he was in a hurry, he erased 120 PLN and next please. . . I was counting on this doctor, given the many good opinions about him. Well, I've just counted myself out. . . . . ."
965,"Stasio. . . a lot of odds with him had 'em, all counted 'em in 1 term. He is quite a specific gentleman closed in his world and likes to irritate with his jokes and sayings such as . about carmine [ not red ! : ) ] chalk etc . but overall he made a very positive impression on me . Supposedly until recently he was a fear, mainly due to Physics I and II, but during my term of office he softened, although as for me it was still quite difficult. Algebra I - the assessment rewritten from exercises so no problemo . Physics I and II - The exam from the whole semester, a lot of material, but it gives issues that are repeated on the exam, which does not change the fact that it is a severe grade, I still haven't come to the point that after writing everything for 80% of the questions I got a minimum of 3.0, but there are also good grades. On the first date, I do not pass much, especially in Physics and (I succeeded only thanks to the fact that he added 20% of the points from the exercises to the pool of points from the exam). In lectures he likes digressions and his jokes, sometimes he gets confused in his own moves: ) Physics I - Exercise - we escaped from the exercises 2 times after having a fight with the porter: ) you came from downstairs and said that ""your trainee shouted at the doorman and ran away in an unknown direction"": ] He/she can solve sentences so that one list can be done and a few exercises, gives points for the task as reported and it pays off later because he/she can remember the plucker so as to point out a person in the lecture hall and call him/her by his/her name: ] It is worthwhile to go to the consultation, especially before the second colloquium, all those present got a lot of points, despite the not always large number of points from the first colloquium (I got 1 - 10 / 20 points and 2 - 20 / 20 points; ]), which gave a nice quadruple. Generally speaking: there is nothing to be afraid of Gladzio, it's cool, man! : )"
966,"I have had this printer for about 2 years. I've printed over 7000 pages on it. He used em for it one original toner and two replacements. The print quality was satisfactory until one moment. I manage to print about 1500 pages on the original toner (later on there is a significant deterioration in print quality). And surprisingly, this is not caused by the exhaustion of the colouring agent . When it comes to printing on envelopes, I am not satisfied . It is very often the case that an envelope has folds. It doesn't look good. The paper container is sufficient, but sometimes it happens that the paper level indicator stops at the very top. It is quite loud when you pull in the paper. It is generally quite a good printer for home use."

Ewa Bocian . Over 30 people participated in the research. The project was carried out in cooperation with the Department of Molecular Genetics and Human Genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, the Department of Medical Genetics, the Department of Pediatrics and the Department of Pediatric Cardiology at the Jagiellonian University Medical College, the Department of Cardiological Pediatrics at the Children's Health Centre in Warsaw, the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology at the Warsaw University of Technology and the Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw."

969,"The unique advantage of the database based on the full genome of 126 healthy, long-lived ( 90 + ) Poles is the combination of clinical, biochemical and genomic data. It is a genetic pattern of a person in good health. It has the form of a database to which the genetic data of each Polish patient can be referenced in order to offer him/her a precise genome diagnosis. Life expectancy and the number of older people will increase in the near future. As dr hab . Małgorzata Mossakowska from the Institute of Cellular and Molecular Biology, people over 90 years of age, without serious problems with everyday life activities (at least 4 points out of 6 possible), without serious problems with memory and cognitive functions (at least 20 points out of 30 possible), who before the age of 80 did not have type 2 diabetes, stroke, myocardial infarction or cancer and had normal or almost abnormal biochemical test results, were selected for the study."

This opinion is confirmed by most even those who have had 5 . if you are a guy you have a chance at 5 only if you are super active you love organic chemistry . you have to go to the guy for a consultation every week and write some extended sheets of paper .

971,"Let's start with breakfasts, these are low quality products without taste. Dinners are not tasty, e.g. aubergine baked in overdue cold meat from a few days earlier. The owner of the hotel is a typical boor flies bad tourist type texts because no money non stop tormenting you to buy something in the bar. The Great Nightmare . In addition, the hotel is not allowed to bring drinks from outside, which the owner pays great attention to, and then he becomes a boor."
972,"exactly ! it all depends on the humor of the leader. As if such a slack, he had to put 5 weaves, and a total of 4 or 5 gave probably the most. without the cards at the entrance - so no stress, but as he sometimes asked when giving the protocol - you do not know what to expect. questions from outer space, easy and difficult . I think he checked the cause only at the beginning, then he evaluated it according to the previous ones. once a colleague gave my cause, he looked: and here it is cool, here it is not much. . and what did she have before? ( he looked at the grades), and, that's 4. ( such were more or less) . At the end of the assessment, he wondered what to put me, ordered to show the index, watched and decided - LOL. The heat helps with doing the exercises, it's quite loose, so if you don't want to get tired, but also don't want to be judged fairly, then sign up."
973,"In addition, the system searches for what city we are in and what weather conditions are there, what is the environmental pollution, pollen concentration, because all these factors can cause exacerbation of the disease. For women with asthma, the answers to questions concerning the possibility of getting pregnant and giving birth to a healthy child have been prepared. As prof . Kuna, introduction of such simple tools, allowing better asthma control, is very important. The research shows that the majority of patients do not obtain any therapeutic goals. A large European survey conducted among 10 thousand asthmatic patients, published in 2010 in the journal "" European Respiratory Review "" . . .showed that up to 70% of patients are affected."

I am not impressed by Zeiss' optics, because of that there are solid cameras and cameras - so: as an addition to the phone - they will get away, but THIS IS ONLY! ! ! As a phone - 6500 slide - is not a satisfactory product in comparison to its price and blown brand. The only advantage is the correct recognition of Polish speech, which the Finns managed to do!

975,"A doctor who is worth recommending, quickly and efficiently recognizes diseases and equally quickly tries to provide the necessary help and information.

Room equipment is old, the tap moves, the door to the balcony does not close. The food is in small quantities and not tasty. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone."
979,"I don't recommend it - for 200 zloty we got a room in the bungalow, with the windows not closing, it was very cold. The same look of the room as in the eighties. The buildings are scaring us off with their appearance. The sidewalks are curved. - If someone goes with a child learning to walk, it's not to Cormoran. Breakfast is fine, the same look of the main building also ok. But the quality of the accommodation is primarily a room, and this one cries out for vengeance to heaven. If the price was 80 zloty, then I would have no objections and would consider the hotel to be average."
980,"Especially on 16 June, when the Czech Republic - Poland match will be played. Then the city will experience a car invasion not only from the Czech Republic, but also from Poland. In turn, it seems that the airport in Poznan should expect special traffic. Two matches of Croatians, two matches of Italians and two matches of Irish, it is almost certain that the visitors will come primarily by ""air bridge"" . It's a pity that Poznan Law Bank is only trying to build its own hotel. In general, it seems that last Saturday's drawing of groups for the Euro 2012 tournament, held in Kiev, was a favor for Poland. And it's not just about the group Poland was in, but about the fact that in the group phase of the tournament, fate has rather spared us the mass invasions of fans from neighboring countries."

Poles, less than in previous influenza seasons. Most people in our country were vaccinated against influenza in 2005. - 8.6% of the population . Since then the number of these vaccinations has been decreasing . In 2007, 6.1% of the population was vaccinated. The number of Poles, and between 2012 and 2014 - only 3.7% .

990,"The study was carried out on over 200 people between 16 and 82 . years of age experiencing so-called psychotic-like symptoms. During the study, it was checked what level of social anxiety characterizes the respondents and how this anxiety may affect the formation of psychotic symptoms. As the researcher explains, by reversing the cognitive bias or modifying it - which can be done by means of special trainings - the probability of developing delusions could theoretically be significantly reduced. ""We then eliminate the factor that favours them. Similar solutions are already being proposed to people who suffer from psychotic disorders. This can also be done for people at risk of psychosis, e.g. relatives of people with psychoses at risk of this type of disorder,"" he points out."
991,"I am very dissatisfied with the atmosphere during the visit. The Doctor advised me against the procedure and probably rightly so. However, the atmosphere of the visit is disastrous and the patient never expects it after a visit to a private office. Even if the patient's problem is ""delusional"" (quoted after the Doctor), the doctor, and especially the doctor receiving in a private practice, has no right to let himself be so patronizing and ""goodbye"" on his forehead with every question asked. I remind you that the visit is not free. I regret that she left me any money there and that she did not share my opinion about her attitude towards the patient with Mrs. Janeczko enough."

993,"She was with her family in early July for 10 days. There are only two swimming pools in the hotel (not 6), there were no dance courses or discos - as reported on the website of the travel agency. The food is very poor, salty. . . . Breakfast drinks are served free of charge, but for dinner you have to pay even for water. The loungers by the pool were dirty, stuck in the food and the umbrellas flew all over the pool (ordinary cheapest plastic umbrellas with a plastic base not flooded with water or a pen). The bathroom has not been renovated for a very long time, the moisture in the shower. EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO DESCRIBE THEIR FEELINGS - THE HOTEL IS NOT RECOMMENDED."
994,"The hotel is located in the capital city of Funchal, about 25 minutes walk to the center. Nearby public transport stop, restaurants and bars. The hotel rooms are very spacious and have a separate rest room. Nice service, cleaning on the level. There is internet (for a fee - of course). The hotel is surrounded by a garden and there are many walking paths to explore. Food . . . . . .unfortunately very modest and weak, you have to admit that it is beautifully served but there is a waitress service and a menu with little choice. So if someone likes to eat well, they'll have to go to a nearby pub to get some more. The only thing that disappoints is the lack of a beach - any. There is a swimming pool near the hotel - not very frequented. Despite the inconvenience of eating, I consider my stay at the hotel to be a successful time in Madeira."
995,"I think that your professor is certainly a specialist in her field, but she often cancels or postpones appointments, is sometimes not punctual, accepts people from outside the queue and is the first to do so. She has experienced this on her own, waiting in front of the office and seeing how the next people ""without a number"" enter before those registered, because they were for example asked by the professor to enter the office. It is appalling, but the patients agree to it because they are determined. I have been treating you for a few months, unfortunately I don't see much improvement so far. I agree with the above opinions in one thing - your professor is kind to the patient."
996,"During the conference Prof. Maciejewski pointed out that the centre in Gliwice is a clinic for oncological and reconstructive surgery and is not a replantological centre - there are no such duty stations, no trauma facilities etc. ""Therefore, in such cases, which include not only injuries to the head and neck region, requiring microvascular intervention, in this case of replantation, we are not able to provide adequate care for patients whose injuries affect a larger area and a larger range,"" he said . At the same time he assured that of course doctors will provide assistance in case of need, because at present in Poland, as he said, there is no specialised centre for face, neck and multi-organ trauma replantation."
997,"She got to her with her six-month-old daughter after visiting another allergologist earlier and I am very happy . She has an attitude towards children, as far as I know she is also a pediatrician. She has examined her daughter carefully, she listened. She listened to me and interviewed me thoroughly. She has made us a detailed diet plan, she has given us a lot of advice and guidance about what I have to eat (breastfeeding) and how to extend the diet to my daughter. Thanks to her, she didn't have to starve (the previous doctor didn't let me eat anything) and quite quickly established what is not harmful. She installed herself with problems with blood in her stool and referred us to additional examinations (another doctor denied it). When she told me that I don't want to give the baby artificial milk, she didn't mention it once again, but she focused on my diet. Very nice, warm person. I recommend it."
998,"I went to this hotel with my boyfriend in May 2017. They spent a week there. I can't express myself about the place except positively. : ) Rooms: The rooms were very clean, cleaned daily. Towels were also changed every day. When the windows are closed the noise from the street is not so annoying. Location: Hotel located close to pharmacies and shops where we can get everything we need on holiday. In terms of noise, this hotel is located near the beach and bars, so there is nothing to expect it to be perfectly quiet, but it is also not the noise that would prevent you from sleeping. Food: The food was delicious! I am still looking for some recipes. The service in the restaurant is very helpful and very nice. You could easily irrigate yourself between meals (which is not so obvious in all hotels). In addition, we went on a trip with our boyfriend to the city of Zakynthos (I recommend it is only a 40-minute walk), as well as for a long hour's walk through the island and without any complications (of course, the day before) we received from the kitchen delicious sandwiches and water for the road. The food in the restaurant was varied, full of both tasty lunch dishes and desserts or fruit - applause for the Chef. And with such a great, customer-caring service as this restaurant you can sometimes only dream of. The only thing she could have noticed was the water in the pool, because it was very cold. But this was because it wasn't heated and in May the sun wasn't yet warmed so that the pool was hot. The biggest advantage is undoubtedly the kitchen."
999,"I have spent two weeks in this hotel and I am one hundred percent satisfied with the service, nice smiling food, delicious, varied games, entertainment all day long until the evening afternoon, the whole staff is engaged to make our holiday as pleasant as possible I recommend to everyone one hundred percent animators fantastic my grandson was delighted and at the end of his stay he crying because he has to leave is probably the best opinion."

Of course, the warranty does not cover glass elements, and you in Amica's customer service could not believe that nobody hit this plate and it broke on its own, even though there is no trace of cracking on the outer layer of the plate! I advise against this board, I will never buy anything from this company again! ! !"

We were received very warmly. We were given answers to every question that tormented us. Doctor Wincewicz is a person very open to human problems with great knowledge and experience.

The doctor found the pregnancy between 5 and 6 weeks and said it was too early to say anything.

1014,"Family hotel decorated in mountain style. To the center ok . 10 min walk . At the hotel there is a bus stop from where every 30 minutes there is a bus to the ski station and goes about 10 minutes. It is worthwhile to use the hotel's transport to the ski lifts, as it is faster, the bus goes about. 5 min . The hotel staff is very nice and speaks good English. Breakfast is good and plentiful, although every day the same. You can also order dinners at the hotel, they are very tasty (they consist of 4 dishes including dessert). This is a good option if you don't want to go downtown looking for a restaurant. A small pool and sauna, all very clean. The rooms are furnished in wood, with a small kitchenette, which is very comfortable. It is worthwhile to order a skipass at the hotel as you can pick it up at the hotel, pay at check-out and it is about 5 - 10% cheaper than the ski lift. The hotel has free parking. The ski room is outside the hotel, but the room is quite poorly heated and shoes do not dry out. I recommend the hotel because of the very quiet surroundings but quite a short distance from the centre of the village."
1016,"She was at the doctor's office (admittedly only for the first time) but I confirm that she is nice. Visiting him is stress-free. As far as competence is concerned, I can't say yet, but going to him she read my opinions on this portal and so far I don't regret that she chose him."
1020,"It's hard for me to compare, as I have no experience with psychiatrists, but in my opinion, the visit was concrete, factual and professional. The doctor conducted a very detailed interview (which is especially important in this branch of medicine) and aroused trust. He did not look at the watch, he did not finish the meeting by force, he even encouraged to ask questions. He called by name what fits my symptoms, recommended medication, observation. I am glad that I went to him."
1028,"The laboratories were held in a pleasant atmosphere : ) No one had the slightest problem with passing. The wheels were really simple, there was nothing to fear. Although it may be because we will not be chemists anyway (it was a course for physics students). Anyway, if you hesitate between Mr. Apostoluk and Mrs. Kołodziej, you already know who to choose ; )"

1035,"Long weekend in November, departure with family, nice apartment, simple without fireworks but also with everything you need - well equipped kitchenette, comfortable sleep. Children are welcome. Breakfast tasty though monotonous - every day the same. The advantage is the location - the entrance to the Koscieliska Valley and the path under the Reglami almost opposite the apartments. The minus is not washed bathroom floor, cobwebs and dust - you just see messy cleaning. Despite these shortcomings, I think we will come back: )"
1037,"It's a good thing. The presence is not obligatory at the lecture, but the doctor says some interesting things, the knowledge is recommended to walk! If you want to have more than 4.0, you have to write a paper (i.e. download something from the net and print it out:)) and then you have 5.0: )"
1038,She was doing your doctor's abdominal ultrasound. The examination is very thorough . She was in the hospital (Clinic on Borowska Street in the gastrology department) and also had this examination with students but it is difficult to compare.

1041,"I think it's the best putty lens on the market. Made of metal and very good quality materials. The aperture ring goes with the proper resistance and stroke. The built-in stability is efficient and really helps in many situations. The lens is very sharp from the largest aperture. Ability bdb . What I will praise it for in addition is a fast autofocus engine - I used it in the beginning with quite a muddy X - E1, now that I have changed to X - T1 I can only praise it! ! ! The last plus is a very well developed sealing system - the lens, even though it is a zoom, does not suck the dust inside at all (I already had many zooms: Nikkory, Sigma and there it was a problem). I recommend it!"
1047,"A group of young people who behaved very loudly and vulgarly stayed at the hotel. Apparently there was no way to calm them down. They had to change rooms at night. To be as far away from the screams of the drunken company as possible, we got a room without HD television because it was too far from the transmitter! ! ! We, not the room staff, reported us a broken tap. At breakfast one, not yet completely sober participant of this group was eating straight from the pots at the buffet. None of the staff paid attention to this. It was only after our intervention that the waitress changed the forks at the platters. The breakfast buffet was a complete Polish standard and had nothing to do with the pictures and descriptions on the Internet. The credit card fee in rallies was not possible, which was associated with a loss to the Euro exchange rate. The credit card fee in zlotys was not possible, which was associated with a loss to the Euro rate."
1048,"The doctor was leading my pregnancy almost to the end. . . . . .because she changed my doctor at the last minute after the persuasions and opinions of her friends. As it turned out in retrospect, it was the best choice she made in my life! ! ! The doctor did not even bother to remind herself of her pregnancy history (or at least important information about the patient) even 5 minutes before the appointment and not to ask the same things every time! Lack of sufficient information, you always had to ""pull the tongue"", which was quite uncomfortable. I agree with the opinion expressed earlier on from the visit, without focusing on the patient! The doctor is very eager to send her husband to ultrasound appointments for that : ) ) Instead of going through the history and looking at the worrying symptoms (at the end of the pregnancy), the doctor sent me for tests (such a walk around town with an endangered pregnancy) instead of putting me to hospital and getting reliable results. . . I ended up looking for a really good ""pregnancy carer"". who immediately put me in the hospital (finding the baby dangerous) where a week later she gave birth to a premature baby. It was a real lucky thing that she found me a good specialist, otherwise I don't know if she could have enjoyed my Kruszyna today: ) )"
1051,"Nice, smiling, friendly service of the whole hotel boarding at the level of no weird food normally good and just that, cleaning and making up the deficiencies quickly and without disturbing our stay, the hotel despite its location on a quiet street you can say that on the outskirts and in the center, the pool is clean warm and relaxing,"
1056,"The hotel is located opposite the station, next to McDonald's. The rooms are large and comfortable. The room is clean. Great plus for staying with a pet and no charges. The hotel also has free parking. Next to the hotel is the grocery store ""Frog"" . In the hotel there is a restaurant serving very tasty meals. You can also buy a lunch set for a small price."
1062,"He spent 5 days at the hotel with his family. It was a good time. The hotel has a good location, close to the forest and nature. The great plus is the indoor and outdoor swimming pool (useful during 30 degrees of heat), a playroom for children and nice and friendly facilities in the garden. Close to all the attractions on the jura. The food is varied and tasty - a big plus for the kitchen. The service is very nice and friendly. Air conditioning in the rooms would be useful, then it would be perfect: ) ."
1063,"we chose this hotel again because it has a very good location. At 7pm. 30 . When asked about the restaurant, a tired young receptionist questioned the possibility of having a meal. After waiting for a long time for the telephone connection to the kitchen (small hotel, reception 15 steps from the restaurant), she advised to hurry up, as the kitchen is already finished. ( ! ) . A very nice waiter served us delicious food. We ate, among other things, lamb whip and fish soup with mussels. They ordered us a beer, and it turned out to be the LAST one. We sat in the restaurant and watched our customers coming to drink beer. Nobody came up with the idea of just buying this beer - there was a hotel car in front of the hotel. Big minus."
1064,"A great hotel for families with children, a large swimming pool divided into three parts with suitable depths. There is no direct descent to the sea from the hotel but it is really close to the beach. The food from the AI package is varied (sweet, spicy, meat, vegetable - no one will be bored - it is worth trying dishes from the so-called ""life cooking"" - b . tasty! ! ! ! ! ! ) . The hotel has quite large rooms overlooking the sea (only those I would aim at, the view of the stop, well), the hotel is well connected, close to Sunny Beach or Old Nessebarr. . . . . .bus stop under the hotel. Animation for kids and hotel guests on a high level. . . . ( Vladi aka VladiCoperfield and the team ( ie : Mario , Eva , Viktor and all of u ) - great Job - keep it up . . . . . . . Thank you for the super 2 weeks. . . . . Luke"
1065,"We've been out for a week in the last days of September. Great conditions, nice hosts, barbecue area, kitchen and terrace with a view of the sea cascading down from the apartment exit. And downstairs there is a small but cosy beach, cleaned and fully equipped as standard. The only thing you can attach to it is that on windy days it flushes from the sewage system, but this is a problem of the whole probably Dalmatian. The owners, however, were standing on their eyelashes to make sure that we were not affected by it. In a word: WORTH!"
1069,"To Dr. . Majkowski was first hit by my family doctor when my family doctor refused to give any medication because of early pregnancy. Dr. Majkowski. Majkowski conducted the examination very carefully and informed me which medications are safe and which should be avoided, as well as precisely defined the situation in which I should turn to him again for an antibiotic treatment. Both during this and subsequent visits I was impressed by his professionalism, the way he handled the patient (when there was an urgent need, the doctor called me twice to consult the treatment) and medical ethics. Unlike many doctors in private institutions, Dr . Majkowski is not commercially oriented (for the second visit in the continuation of treatment he paid only 50 zloty. When I was threatened with dehydration instead of charging for the visit, the doctor sent me to the E.R. by phone so that I would not wait for an appointment). I highly recommend!"
1073,"In fact, Mr. Dr. Dr. Dr. is very thorough for a small amount, he is quite nice and eager to help. The downside to this is that during my visit, Mr. Dr. Dr. was doing private things over the phone and could not advise me on the cure, she heard me say that it was only my decision. However, I think he should know better what is better for me. This does not change the fact that he is one of the few gynaecologists who remembers the breast examination and stresses its importance, which is extremely important."
1074,"Refers to the lecture on biotechnology elements of chemical technology . The lectures are interesting, but it is difficult to make good notes, because the Doctor is terribly ""flying""."
1076,"a young doctor. She went to her first time in August 2011 being 8 weeks pregnant. To now she leads me . She was m on 3 visits, today I'm going on a fourth one. Positive feelings, a very thorough doctor, is not ashamed to reach for the book when it comes to matching the right medicine to my blood or urine results. I still have doubts if she is not too young to lead my pregnancy (this is my first baby). I hesitate to change my doctor to a more experienced one, but only because of the inner feeling that with so little experience she may miss something. . I recommend it anyway! and certainly young girls who are afraid to visit gin: ) at her place it is a pleasure : )"
1077,"I sincerely recommend Mrs. Violetta . Thanks to the individually selected menu I managed to shed almost 10 kg without much effort. The meals are tasty and do not feel hungry. Diet from Mrs. Viola is not only to determine the time of meals but also to realize how much should be eaten and how much food should be provided for the body. Meals are easy to prepare and the most important thing is that they are tasty. During the transformation, above all, there has been a change in my habits and my own attitude and I think that thanks to Mrs. Viola I have been most successful here. The body is at its highest speed and full of energy. Thank you Mrs. Viola."
1082,"The hotel is located close to the forest, the quiet and fresh air gives a lot of satisfaction to guests. As far as the hotel is concerned, its standards are as adequate as possible to the price. The room in particular made a good impression on me, it was spacious, but cosy and furnished to five. Very nice service in the company of which we feel very pleasant. Also worth mentioning is the rich menu that everyone should try, I really recommend ""bon appetit"" . Time spent in "" HOTEL POSTA "" I remember very nice and certainly soon I will visit it again."
1085,"Very nice therapist, with a lot of knowledge. . . . this is my first visit, I am quite a complicated case with a lot of work in the future, however, Mr. Bartosz managed to improve and this on my first visit, problems with my temporomandibular joint. . . the fact that it was not pleasant, but the effect is - for the first time I ate a normal breakfast without any pain. . . He has this ""human"" approach to the patient, he also explained a lot and asked what I liked very much, you could find out interesting things, he did not look at the watch every now and then, he did not rush because he has another patient. . . . .as a plus, I recommend to all those who have unusual symptoms, aching every part of the body - this therapist will help."
1086,"Looking for a way to counteract this and change the fate of children with nodular sclerosis, prof . Jóźwiak started ok . 5-6 years ago he started to perform frequent electroencephalography (EEG) of the brain every four weeks in newborns with the diagnosed disease. The idea was to quickly identify active changes in the EEG record heralding the beginning of epileptogenesis. The researchers also proposed antiepileptic treatment at this stage, even before the epilepsy occurred. This was a completely new approach. In 2011, the European Journal of Pediatric Neurologists published the results of a study which covered 45 children with nodular sclerosis. It showed that administering antiepileptic drugs before the onset of epileptic seizures significantly reduces the risk of mental retardation of children. In the treated group the percentage of toddlers who were diagnosed with epilepsy was 14%. In the control group, i.e. treated only when the epilepsy symptoms occur - 48%. According to prof . Jóźwiak, a new therapeutic approach completely changes the prognosis of sick children."
1088,"Where do we start here? I've been staying at the hotel, Gronie, for just four days. Negative things will dominate the review. . . The first thing is the appearance of the hotel. At first glance the object does not look bad, however, the deeper into the forest the more mushrooms, so it was also in this case. The hotel is very bland. It is outdated, wordless. So are the rooms. The furniture in the room - old, a TV set the size of a laptop monitor and in addition a discoloured carpet. The only advantages of my suite were the whirlpool bath and its size. Another disadvantage was the scandalous quality of room cleaning. After inviting the ""staff"" to the room in order to clean it turned out that the room was only vacuumed. There were no bed linen, no shoes lying at the door were even moved. It is also worth mentioning the food served. The dishes were typically, ""canteen"" - not suitable for the hotel. The service in the canteen was very good, the ladies bringing the food were very nice. The hotel is located in addition away from the center of Szczyrk. This is good or bad? It depends on the destination. The bad impression is also made by small details such as the lack of efficient billiard sticks (only one not broken stick for 2 tables)."
1092,"Dr. Pluta is a very nice person who is aware of the fact that physical exercises can be difficult. Colloquia is easy to do, it is interesting to do exercises, it is easy to pass if you know the basics. However, I have a personal injury because he lowered my grade for . . . . . .character of writing ( sic ! ) . But I still recommend it."
1094,"Although the doctor has a specific style of being, negates many things and gives quite authoritative opinions, but to the competence and substantive knowledge I can not have reservations. After visiting many Luxmed doctors (almost all of them in the specialty of gynaecologist - endocrinologist), she was the first to give me extensive information, touching on many important topics that I would not even think about. Later I was treated for over a year in the infertility clinic to which she referred me and everything she said was confirmed, which means that she knew what she was saying. I recommend it!"
1101,"I spent 2 nights in the hotel, a room on the 26th floor seemed attractive, beautiful view, clean room, spacious, for one person too. In front of me two days of training, I had to be fresh to be able to focus, without falling asleep to absorb interesting content. Everything would have been okay, but the noise at night, probably with the equipment on the roof, no air conditioning, this worked quietly to prevent normal sleep. Two nights, no comfort of rest, that's a shame. Like the Hilton is an overnight stay somewhere at half height. There is supposedly the night silence as I imagine it. And a funny little thing. In a restaurant in a salt shaker, no salt . The attention paid to the waitress lack any reaction, maybe good because the salt is unhealthy."
1102,"She was at Dr. Kłósek's halfway through the ultrasound. There she found out that my child has swelling and possibly hydrocephalus. A week later she had an ultrasound done in the clinic and it turned out that there is no swelling (disappeared?!) and three doctors confirmed it. As for the head it turned out that the toddler has a slightly larger head, but no hydrocephalus is mentioned, which was also confirmed yesterday in the clinic. How did she find out from a neurologist, Dr. Kłósek Badly Measuring the head ! Actually, it's the horns in the head, that's why his hydrocephalus came out. Excuse me, but somehow I believe 5 doctors more than one! He erased me for 200 PLN, got a plate on which you can not see anything (I mean 3D / 4D), he made me and my family nervous and caused a lot of tears, which did not have to be. I DISCOURAGE IT!"
1108,"dr n . med . Bogdan Badowski is not only a professional but also a doctor with a vocation. For years I have been struggling with the problem of recurring abscesses, so I met many specialists on my way. My friend is also being treated by Dr. Badowski. My friend is also being treated by Dr. Badowski. The doctor has an individual approach to the patient, he is objective, gives exhaustive answers and most of all he knows how to entertain probably everyone (which is very important in this specialization - after all, these are some of the least pleasant tests). I recommend it to everyone."
1109,"This thing is missing and missing ! The dirty pool is not usable, the paddling pool is even worse. Around the broken floor - threatens to injure at best. Around seemingly ok, but just look in every corner and there is an indescribable mess. Cleanliness of the hotel very average . Towels are not changed during weekend stays, they do not make beds, etc . . . The kitchen is a theory to choose one soup, one dish, one dessert. The service as if to say it gently I get the impression that from the case. The place has great potential - it's a pity that it wasn't used. Kazimierz is empty - I wonder why?"
1111,"A great dentist. Mr. Michał is a professional in every aspect of his work . I am a very picky person when it comes to specialists in the field of dentistry through bad experiences, I have never had a fear of pain or procedures performed; I was always afraid of the dentist's approach: here it is completely different - you come to visits with joy and positive energy and come out with even better energy and smile. Living in Gdańsk, I prefer to come to ORSMED especially to be ABSOLUTNELY sure that a specialist like Mr. Michał will take care of every stage of treatment at the best level. I really recommend to everyone, especially to those who have always been afraid of any dental treatments - here they will completely forget about negative memories and visits will be a pure pleasure."
1115,"Opinion on the basis of the course of fluids I On the faculty : IŚ Way of conducting classes : understandable Can he teach ? Yes Basis of assessment in the index / pass/fail: exam - test (42 questions, a - b - c) Unexpected: no sense of humour General approach to the student: neutral Lectures are for copying, and only this is required, it is also good to work out the questions from previous years, 3 times check attendance during the semester, 1 attendance = 1 good answer to the exam, if one learns it will pass without any problem"
1116,"Just yesterday, after 3 meters of waiting for the visit, she was for the third time with her ailments at Dr. Krynicki's. On the basis of one result of FT 4 concluded that I have thyroiditis, he did not consider it appropriate to inform me what follows from this, he did not recommend any treatment, he just pointed out that we will have to meet. Given my age (68 years old) and the next appointment (in three metres' time), I dare say that this doctor is the one who will no longer be able to cure my body. Where do such doctors come from and why doesn't anyone verify it?"
1126,"A nightmare in the full sense of the word. We went out with two families. The rooms were completely dirty, mould and fungi on the walls in the bathrooms, rust on the fixtures, rust on the showers, dripping water from the washbasins, cracked walls, mould on the ceilings after the rain, hair in the washbasins and showers, rust on the doors, window frames without plasterwork, Plastic tables and chairs in front of the entrance cracked and brown from dirt, cracked terraces and stairs without tiles (on old concrete), rotten fruit remains in the closet just after moving in, lots of rubbish around the buildings, pavements with huge holes in the concrete, covered with rubble, animal excrement. Food cannot be eaten for sanitary and aesthetic reasons (visual). After 4 days we all had to resign from food and provide our own meals. The manager of the resort offered us a free deckchair for 6 days as compensation. In the gym most of the equipment was damaged, inoperative, electric cables protruded from the floor. This was the apogee of humiliation of us and our children. The offer of the hotel according to the pictures is completely inconsistent with the real state."
1140,"At the Klimek Hotel, we were staying about a week, we had a super suite consisting of a large living room, bedroom, hallway and two bathrooms and a Jacuzzi. However, the spell was already gone on the first evening of dinner, which simply sucks. . . . . .as it later turned out, apart from the hotel guests, people from the guesthouses next to the hotel also came. The same night, it turned out that the heating in the apartment was turned off, after the phone call to the reception desk, it was turned on again. The next day we reported at the reception to not turn off the heating because there are small children with us and that we want to resign from dinner (or change to a choice from the menu card) and talk to the manager, but they dashed us. . . . . . . . .in the next two nights they also turned off the heating for us despite our requests and threats, it should be added that they turned it off back to the reception desk phone at night. An important issue is also the fact that during the first days our apartment was only cleaned after the phone call to the reception desk. Everything changed on the fourth day when we complained in writing about everything that was happening in this so-called hotel. The nice reception manager was trying to turn everything around so that it was good and she almost succeeded. However, I have to add this opinion because for staying in this hotel we paid more than 5500 zloty and certainly we will never come back because it does not deserve 4 *, it pisses off customers and tries to save on heating, just a farce. I do not recommend"
1141,"Scandinavian hotel chain Scandic is one of the leading companies in the accommodation industry implementing ecological solutions. No wonder that the two hotels of the chain operating in Poland turned out to be the first chain facilities in Poland, which managed to meet the extremely restrictive criteria of the European Union, as a result of which Scandic Gdansk and Scandic Wroclaw hotels received the official EU Ecolabel certificate. The EU Ecolabel certificate can be obtained after the implementation of the environmental policy with the simultaneous, carefully implemented adjustment of product and service elements to the requirements of the European Commission, both globally and locally."
1142,"Apartments Jan is a very nice and cozy guest house. Rooms are furnished simply but in a highlander spirit. Clean and peaceful . An unquestionable advantage in winter days is the sauna and jacuzzi - just sign up for the list and you can warm up at the chosen time. The rooms are of course equipped with a (spacious) bathroom, TV set and also a kettle. The guesthouse is a little away from the center, but you can easily walk and return to Krupówki - even after a few cups of mulled wine. The only obstacle can be a steep driveway to the property, which in winter can cause problems."
1143,"The hotel, far from the center, confused us with the hrs description. . To the station about 1km. Next to the road construction . Trams go a bit further. . I regret that I did not check the map because about 35 minutes you have to go to the market square . The room is nice, but the air conditioning did not work and was 30 degrees. . Breakfast was not included in the price, parking lot was not. I wouldn't visit again. ."
1145,"Courses: Analysis 1 , Analysis 2 , Algebra 1 . (all exercises, people after the lecture I see have some misconceptions) For me no. 1 (which will not say 50% of the group that has failed) [ / b ] Generally very cheerful, very well aimed at students. However, demanding and always fails at least 40% of people . I advise you to think, if someone is going to do nothing and not go to classes, it is better to choose someone else."
1152,"The need to increase awareness in this area was pointed out by Dr Wojciech A, acting chairman of the Emergency States Resuscitation and Medicine Section of the Polish Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care. Rychlik from the Upper Silesian Medical Center in Katowice . The various aspects of saving human life and health will be discussed by specialists from all over Poland during the conference ""Resuscitation.plus from a to z "" . The conference will be held on 9-10 June in Katowice . Anaphylactic shock is one of many possible causes of the need to use resuscitation. Participants of the conference will also discuss the issues of rapidly developing sepsis, including in children, as well as helping patients in a state of deep hypothermia. Numerous practical workshops are also planned."
1153,"I advise against it! ! Unfortunately, I was treated by Dr. Buldecka for 6 years exactly since I was 18 because I had a problem with the period. I agree that she is very nice, she has time to say everything, but . . . She hasn't told me what's really wrong with me in 6 years. . . She was prescribing drugs (hormones), I was taking m, once helped, once not. . . . .the results of their interpretation have been different. . . After these 6 years, she changed my doctor and it turned out that I had a suspicion that the ovaries were going out (premature menopalysis) even though I was 24 years old! ! ! ! ! ! I definitely don't recommend it, I just lost my time and most of all mine, only I don't know if I'll get that time back in any way. . ."
1154,"Hotel at a very high level. Excellent food . Rooms very cozy and clean . Spa area is not bad, but there is a lack of a gym. The Jacuzzi could be larger in terms of the number of guests - most often occupied for hours by the same people. Near the sauna there is no shower - you have to go to the other side of the pool, which is a little bit of a missed target."
1155,"My husband and I spent two nights in this hotel last weekend. It was quite all right - we had a large double room with a bathroom, clean and well lit, but certainly not luxurious, although for us just fine. There were some small inconveniences, e.g. the room had no mirror, the cushions were too flat, but besides that we are satisfied. Breakfast was plentiful and the service was nice and helpful, especially the young girl at the reception. The hotel has a good location, very close to the city centre, shops and restaurants. There are also weekend discounts for rooms. The hotel offers free Wi Fi, but it is not the best."
1156,The hotel is not worth the money! We were with our husband and our 1 or 5 year old daughter for 11 days hotel rooms not for 4 stars but for 2. We had to pay almost 200 euros for a room that had a bath. The food was very poor. The rooms had spiders and ants that even went to bed. I do not know if the trip that cost almost 20 thousand zlotys should look like this
1157,"One of the most interesting hotels where 'em were staying ( and I've been going for almost 10 years and slept in dozens of hotels ). Hotel Gwarna on the roof has a beach, deck chairs, an open air bar. Inside the hotel there is a swimming pool with sauna. The pool is not big but it is important that it is . Breakfast is very correct - big choice, nice staff - there is nothing to attach to. I recommend."
1161,"We went for a romantic weekend (nice atmosphere, spa, etc.). There was a drama. In the mess rooms, we ordered a double bed, but we had two small beds. A sauna, jacuzzi for two people (at the same time they sat 4), instead of a massage, the lady massaged our cream in 5 minutes. Unpleasant service etc. Never again!"
1163,"This was my first visit to the doctor's and I will certainly come back because I am happy with it. The doctor has interviewed me in detail, performed a thyroid ultrasound, and has asked me to do some tests after which I have to come back for an appointment to determine further treatment. I recommend it."
1167,"The doctor treated me very condescendingly, so much so that he didn't even bother to tell me what medications he was prescribing me, and I quote, ""a hormone drug that will lower testosterone levels"". which is not a particularly clear name for a two-component contraceptive pill. He did not say a single word about my disease (including not naming it!), he did not commission hormone tests (which were the main purpose of my visit), he did not perform transvaginal ultrasound. By the way, he unjustifiably criticized my previous gynaecologist (Doctor, do you not remember the content of the doctor's promise?). There was literally no question about the risk of thrombosis due to the fact that I was prescribed estrogens, nothing about the risk of diabetes, in a word: you can exchange and exchange. I'll skip the minor unpleasantness here and there, because there are more than enough problems of substance. I do not recommend it, unless the situation looks different in a private office."
1168,"I don't agree with your opinion of martha137.It's not fair that you accuse someone of impersonating you just because they have a different opinion than you.I'm the same person then, because I'm going to write a flattering opinion on your Dr. rubric and I agree with these three opinions? I'm very happy with your rubric! I think he is a very good doctor! She has a very good attitude towards the patient. She is nice, she approaches the patient with understanding and empathy. and this is very important in such a sensitive area. She is also professional. I go to her private office. There is a pleasant atmosphere. I write about it because I think it's also important to feel good in the office itself, especially since for many women a visit to the gynecologist is a lot of stress. I was nervous too, but thanks to Dr. Dr. I'm not familiar with this feeling anymore. I've been your patient for a long time and I don't think anything will change.)"

1185,"Hotel from the outside very nice and the fact that it's over. The reception desk doesn't really inform you about anything, you have to ask for everything. The service say it depends who nice you can not complain about the bartenders and serve the room. The cleaners of the massacre for a week's stay not once did not wash the bathtub or the mirror I do not require not knowing what, but to wash the bathtub is probably falling out. The food may be tasty, but please, the Polish cuisine is so diverse that you can really come up with something more than boiled potatoes, fried and baked potatoes and fish fried or filled with something. There are not enough people to serve and the poor don't make the food. They put up a group seller and the offer on the coupon has nothing to do with reality. Spa well as cold and dirty water or hot but not working microscopic swimming pool 3 people are already a crowd. The beach a little sand pseudo mole or as it is called. The swimming area is separated, probably for the children themselves, 2rawlers and canoes that you have to get up at 8 o'clock or the bowls are allowed to go to the pool. Just sneeze nothing! ! ! Only the neighborhood is beautiful, and fortunately it's possible to ride in the field thanks to the nearby stud farm."
1187,"the camera - tragedy ! ! ! You can see it when you throw it on the combo, the games cut themselves, I will add that for example on LG bello which I bought 3 years ago with 1gb frame and similar slingshot are much better pictures and the same games do not cut themselves. For the LG I gave 500 PLN. The battery lasts a long time but cannot be replaced by itself! In Zona in Huawei, after a year he recharges batteries 2x a day - he also has non-removable batteries and at the beginning, just like xiaomi held for a long time. The Internet works fast. I think that the phone is weak and I am surprised by the general admiration of this product. I'm annoyed that when I move the phone away from my ear during a conversation and after a while I get to the bottom of it, I often squeeze something, e.g. hang up the phone, turn off the microphone and other things there... . ...we have to judge above (appearance, functionality and batteries) the appearance - standard, functionality as in any android, the battery lasts a long time but cannot be replaced. . . . There is absolutely nothing to admire. It shouldn't cost more than £400."
1191,"A place with potential, although, due to the number of tourists quite crowded and not very quiet. The worst thing is that at night nobody makes sure that there is silence in the area - drunken guys shouted under the windows and did not want to be silent. In the morning, the staff said that there is security in the area. . . But maybe they're mainly watching to avoid stealing the plants - the signs scaring the police are everywhere. And nobody cares about the guests' peaceful sleep! In the inn the waitress didn't come up to us for almost 20 minutes. . . Idyll, right?"

He helped me not only to overcome the cancer, but to go all this way in a calm, understandable way, with the idea that I am in the best hands. Thanks to his undoubtedly high qualifications and many years of medical practice he is able to quickly diagnose the disease and determine the most effective treatment. With all the knowledge I recommend you to Dr. med. Aleksander Niziołek to all those who were diagnosed with cancer."
1196,"This is the first visit, so it is difficult to give an opinion. I'm sure he can listen. It is based on surveys, which on the one hand makes a person feel a little bit like on an exam, but on the other hand, the person is able to determine the size of the problem."
1197,"Definitely a good and recommendable expert. Mrs. Joanna is a kind, warm and empathetic person for whom the patient is always in the first place, not only the treatment itself and its effects, which by the way are always fantastic, but also the well-being of the other person in this case of the patient. One of the few doctors who talks to the patient about the planned treatment, its possibilities, always trying to choose and help in making the best decision, in this very important issue which is the treatment. I met with a similar standard of work only during my treatment in the Panaceum clinic in £ód¼ with Professor Suliborski."
1199,"Hello, does Dr. Zbigniew Janik accept you in some private office or only in the Hospital at 29 Józefa Babińskiego Street? ? I ask for some information ! My problem is everyday headaches and I am only 23 years old. Despite the fact that I have all the good results, the pains are more and more frequent and stronger. Thank you in advance ~ !"
1200,"E . P . : Children's skin is built just like adults', but their immune system is not developed enough to react quickly and efficiently to external factors, so they are less protected also from the sun. When children are at the water, they often play by the shore, and that is where it is easiest to get burned. Water drops on the skin act as a lens - they concentrate the radiation. On foreign beaches we can see children by the water in T-shirts and shorts. This is reasonable, because even if they get wet, staying in wet clothes in the hot sun will not harm them, and even cools them, while protecting them from the sun. There are already clothes for children with sunscreens available on the market. It is also necessary to remember about more frequent relubrication, because while playing in the sand children can wipe off the cream. It should also be remembered that while in water we also sunbathe - up to 2.5 m deep the radiation is the same as on land."
1201,"This is what the authors of the educational campaign entitled ""The future of the European Union"" prove. ""The answer is in your blood! ” The Commission has also been working on the development of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for Human Use, organised for the early detection of blood and bone marrow diseases, including haematological cancers. According to the data of the National Cancer Register (KRN), the number of new hematopoietic and lymphatic cancers has more than doubled in Poland over the last three decades. Demographic and epidemiological prognoses are not optimistic - Polish society is ageing and in some blood and marrow diseases advanced age is a risk factor. Diagnosis in this group is hindered by the propensity of elderly people to explain their malaise in old age, and they may, for example, suffer from myelofibrosis - one of the rarest but extremely dangerous blood cancers."
1202,"Maybe a good specialist, but he sinks patients completely. On 2 out of 5 visits I was asleep. Moreover, despite the low result of the study, welcome D recommended to take her only on 3 visits. Complete failure and throwing money into the mud . The visits looked like he was half asleep analyzing the results and then had 1 hormone tested between the 2nd and 5th day of the cycle in order to recommend another hormone test for the next visit. As a result, it has been half a year since the visit to the hospital and the results obtained then may no longer be reliable. It is possible that he used to be a good specialist, but now it is important for him to make money."
1203,"It's been a year since my breast augmentation surgery. I am very pleased and happy. Breasts are perfect scars with little visible. I have never regretted my decision if I knew it would look like this for a long time to come (I am 30 years old). A nice doctor, a wonderful man after the operation always answers the phone and answers my ( sometimes stupid ) questions. I also have a very nice memory of staying in the hospital and two days in the nice company of a nurse were smiling at every call. I recommend it! ! ! Dr . Kubasik the best of the best! I love"

""We want to create an innovative and cheaper valve than those available on the market. This will make it more accessible to Polish patients"" - said the head of the Research and Development Centre AHP ( CBR AHP ) dr hab . Krzysztof Milewski . The introduction to clinical practice of minimally invasive procedures and percutaneous aortic valve implantation technique in the so-called TAVI technology several years ago was a breakthrough in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis. Previously, the only method of treatment of this acquired defect was surgical surgery. One third of patients over 75 . However, patients over 75 years of age suffering from this condition are not eligible for such surgery due to too high a risk. It is for them that TAVI treatments are addressed."
1207,"Hello. I think this man shouldn't even call himself a doctor. She was at his place 3 times paid m kupe money didn't examine me as he should have just looked at the rectum, and I think that for this money the examination was due. But it's nothing. The funny thing is that he couldn't tell what was wrong with me. He only prescribed me hemorrhoids and mycosis ointment. Later on, when the medication didn't work without seeing my obesity, he wrote me out some ointment stuck in the pharmacy for 6 zloty, after which the anus and groove turned purple. I went to him to explain the matter . . He said he didn't see any skin changes. . ""I remind you that she had a violet m almost, that the anus and groove became purple."" And the late one said that if I see any changes, then he can do the procedure. . . She went to another proctologist. She showed me the drugs to him this guy said that the ""doctor"" with whom she was with before treated me for all possible diseases only not the one I have now. Turned out I had something else. Another proctologist experienced guy to whom she went to me did a very special examination, he told me what was wrong with me and wrote me aptly medicated because after 2 weeks all symptoms disappeared. So if somebody really cares about his health, let him avoid this guy from far away. The pharmacist in the pharmacy knows more than this man. Greetings."
1208,"I wouldn't recommend it. After arriving at the agreed time, it waited for half an hour in line which nobody checked, as it turned out later a few people came earlier and entered the office before me. The visit lasted less than 10 minutes. I was told to do a test on Helicobacter and come back. The doctor didn't advise me to read the card carefully to find out that the examination was already done. When she asked me for additional tests, she said that after that we would continue to do another one. So another visit. The so called ""visit"" cost me 150PLN and nothing of it wasn't. She just wasted my time and money. She signed me up for another doctor who actually treats me."
1210,"It was just an overnight stay with breakfast, but still very low. Tight rooms, furniture like in a teenager's room. Fortunately, relatively clean. But the ""restaurant"" and breakfast is just a drama. Dirty tables and tablecloths. Breakfast is a separate plate with a few slices of sausage, cheese, tomato and cucumber. Cut and lined up on plates at least a day before. We were afraid to eat it."
1211,"It was my first visit to this doctor. I was received on time. The doctor listened to me patiently, examined me, wrote a prescription and referred me to additional examinations. The visit took place in a nice atmosphere. I only give a good grade, because I am not yet able to assess his competence. For the visit itself, the culture, the attitude towards the patient I give "" 6 "" . The advantage is also the availability of appointment dates."
1212,"The doctor informs about the price after the fact when there is no chance to withdraw. She treated her teeth quite long after she arrived in Warsaw. The last time was when she filled my left one and made a crown for my right one. The effect was so bad that she had to go to another dentist who took it all off and made a two-piece crown from the beginning. The crown was too big and too dark and the filled one was ground, it was something terrible. I do not recommend the services of this dentist to anyone."
1213,"I'll give you a very good rating if there are effects, because we are after the first visit. The first impression the doctor made on me good. First of all, a concrete and factual conversation. I liked the fact that he did not immediately order to throw everything away for eating, as his predecessors did. Now I am waiting for the results in the child. I can certainly assess the approach to the patient and the atmosphere for five. You can see (at first impression) that he does not do it for money, and that's a big plus."
1214,"Yesterday she had the worst doctor's appointment, and she had a lot of it. Mrs. Gawur was negative from the very beginning for an unknown reason. She was spraying and contemptuously turned to me ""listen, child..."" . I will add here that I am 27 years old. Mrs. Gawur (I cannot call her Doctor because I think it is an insult to this profession) did not want to know her medical history or the results she had with me. She just looked at the X-rays and said that everything was fine, even though she tried to tell her that the previous results showed something different, apart from the fact that she came with a radiating pain from her spine to her leg, which has been going on for two months. She expected me to have a constructive conversation, but I couldn't get a word with her. She interrupted me in the middle of my sentence and when she didn't manage to tell me everything, she said it was all there and I was to leave. She had an interview with the neurosurgeon who is doing the spine treatments and she wanted to share it with me and she could find out something about it, but Mrs. Gawur had no idea that such treatments exist at all. They have been performed in the world for 5 years, so maybe it would be worthwhile to train Mrs. Gawur in modern medicine. It's really a shame and a misunderstanding with such an under-educated person and the addition of a deterrent to patients working in a private health service. With contempt, she asked me if I ""have a subscription here at all."" because if she didn't, she'd talk to me even worse, so I'd rather not even imagine how. I was also struck by Mrs. Gawur's statement that ""here is Poland, nothing can be done"". I can imagine such a statement from an NFZ employee, but when you pay for private health care, such texts are probably not very appropriate. To sum up, I wasn't even able to come up with a word and tell you why I came and tell you what was going on. She was treated like garbage and that's how she felt to me. I'm shocked by this lady's attitude and the fact that ENEL - Med . She has never met such a terrible, unpleasant, contemptible person, let alone a doctor. Where is her approach to the man? Where is the decent treatment? Where is her passion for the profession or for helping people? Where is empathy? The lack of all this is staggering. I do not wish anyone to contact this lady. After such a visit you lose faith in people and pure human kindness."
1215,"Dr. Rudnicka is haughty and not nice to patients. She experienced this while lying in the endocrinology ward in Karowa. You can't get any information from her about the test results. She is also not very sensitive during gynaecological examinations. She still has a lot to learn and besides, I do not know why a well-known doctor advertises himself as an endocrinologist has nothing to do with an endocrinologist being an ordinary medical doctor . She found out about it while lying on the ward ."
1218,"I've had these headphones for a long time and I'm more than happy. They are light and comfortable, once applied they do not fret, you can wear them for a long time without negative feelings. Very good sound quality, as for this price range. The cable is quite short and thin but I use these headphones mainly for portable players so as for me this is an advantage. After a while the net at the band broke off, but I don't feel any difference when wearing them without it. A practical adapter is included. I recommend these headphones with a clear conscience."
1219,"""The mitral valve ring, colloquially speaking + ruptured + from the myocardium. Due to a defect in both valves, a woman's life was endangered and she could die at any time,"" explains the head of the Cardiac Surgery Clinic of the University Clinical Hospital in Białystok, Professor Tomasz Hirnle, quoted in a press release. The operation was performed together with a cardiologist from the Upper Silesian Medical Centre, Dr Grzegorz Smolka . Doctors operated on the patient without extensive opening of the chest - they made only a few centimeters incision on the left side of the chest. ""The patient was in a severe condition and was unable to get out of bed due to dyspnea. The classic reopening of the chest by reopening the chest, in the extracorporeal circulation, was too risky. The only solution in her case was percutaneous (transcutaneous) surgery,"" explains a hospital spokeswoman."

It will be able to be used in the treatment of cold - hypothermia"" - said PAP author of the idea, Dr. Ziemowit Ostrowski from the Silesian University of Technology. The scientist is raising money to implement his idea. Misterman, because that's how the dummy was called by its creator, will allow to keep the body at the temperature expected by the doctor and properly lower the body temperature. ""The doctor knows the patient's temperature at a given moment, and the dummy will tell him what it will be like in five minutes if he keeps the patient's cooling at the current level. If he sees that the patient is too cold, he will be able to react accordingly,"" said Dr. Ostrowski."
1221,"Nice service, rooms, rooms, all praised. Manadzer is a nightmarish beetroot, the ladies at the reception are angry and probably bored with life. The disco is a typical landlord's shop, the coke guards are standing up, the police come regularly. I do not recommend it."
1222,"I don't recommend it. I went to your doctor with the spots that jumped out after I bathed in the lake and first I was asked rudely enough if it wasn't a venereal disease and then treated with zero interest, a quick glance, a statement that it was nothing like that, without going into the details of what it was, when it came down, when it came back etc. It is clearly worth to be nice only for the patient who comes to an expensive rejuvenating treatment."
1223,"Decent 3-star standard, good location for those interested in the Jura, small but nice SPA, great masseur - P . Grzegorz - the strongest point of this hotel. Nice service. The rooms are clean, but without madness. The biggest reservations to the kitchen. We were at a 3-day business meeting in a group of several dozen people. After two earlier lunches, everyone unanimously refused to eat the last lunch at the hotel and this probably speaks for itself. We couldn't dare to be surprised how you can make inedible mashed potatoes. . . The chef has succeeded! The next day, he improved it with ""rubber"" dumplings. Spices are foreign to him. The sour cream has nothing to do with the sour cream. The arrogance of the Directorate is surprising. Despite such clearly formulated dissatisfaction of customers, it decided to charge us with the full cost of the cancelled lunch, offering to refund the money for . . . . .puree and hoof. . . Ladies and Gentlemen . . . . .this is how the Teddy Bear was treated. . ."
1224,"Villa Alpejska is located 1 km from the city centre, in a rather busy street. During rush hour traffic can be so heavy, it takes a few minutes to cross the street and at night it can have trouble falling asleep. So if possible, ask for a room with a view of the courtyard. The rooms are nice and very clean. Each of them has a balcony which is open to the neighbours. There is a flat-screen TV and a refrigerator, but remember to take your own soap and shampoo with you. If you want to make coffee or tea, you can do it in the hallway. Breakfast is served from 9 to 10. They serve different types of cheeses, hams, yoghurt and fresh bread in buffet form. There are at least 2 small supermarkets nearby (direction of the Vistula river centre) and a restaurant serving local cuisine the other way round. If you feel like something sweet, there is a great cafe near the restaurant."
1225,"Compared to the previous month, the biggest price drop was recorded in Sopot (PLN 334, - 24%) . Guests pay 42% less for accommodation in the Baltic spa resort than in July ( 580 PLN ) . Sopot remains the most expensive Polish destination, although the price difference between it and Warsaw (322 PLN) is only 12 PLN (July: 316 PLN) . Much cheaper tourists also spend the night in Gdansk (254 PLN, - 20 %) and Katowice (220 PLN, - 13 %) . In terms of hotel prices Poland is still one of the cheapest EU countries. Lower costs for accommodation can only be expected in Romania (PLN 271) and Bulgaria (PLN 245) . On average we will pay most for a hotel in Sweden (PLN 635), France (PLN 609) and Denmark (PLN 580)."
1226,"I am not satisfied with the visit, which lasted maybe 8 minutes. . . The doctor herself is nice and polite, but in the age of the Internet I think she should tell me more than what she read about her problem. She was expecting some ""examination"" due to skin problems and there was nothing like that here. . . And the cost of the visit. . for my 8-minute visit she paid m 100zl where she only heard what she already knew, I think it is a little too much, for the only effort that was to get a receipt at the cash desk, I will not go any more, I am looking for more."
1227,"The 3-star Mercure Cieszyn Hotel offers 78 rooms and suites with separate bedroom and living room. Business travellers can use one of four air-conditioned and professionally equipped conference rooms. There are more than 700 Mercure hotels in 49 countries worldwide, 16 of which are located in Poland together with the Cieszyn hotel. Mercure is one of the best recognized hotel brands. Hotels of this chain combine modernity with the historical character of the place. With the rebranding of a hotel in Cieszyn, the number of hotels operating under the Orbis brand has dropped to four. Such facilities are located in Bielsko-Biała, Gdańsk, Gdynia and Wrocław."
1228,"Photos of the facility super, price low as for the Spa, so we decided to go. When we get to the site the same negative surprises. The live hotel is an abandoned orello full of spiders and neglected vegetation. The building is full of curved corridors, and we're in a baby and a pram. Non stop we had to carry a pram up the stairs regardless of where we were moving. Rooms, restaurant, pool. On the wall in the hall there is a painting with naked girls, pedophilism. The next step is a room - us with a child, and there is a basement clinic and the stench of an old grandmother's house. A funny shower, hot water you do not regulate and the rest of you guess. The fridge on the table with ikei, placed next to the bed, made noise all night. The carpet was stained, I'm going to throw up as soon as I write about it. On TV, 3 channels crosswise. The terrace is full of cobwebs and spiders around the windows. It turned out that our room was open all the time, the lock mechanism was broken. They gave us another room, it was bigger but more stairs and spiders, so I can't appreciate it. The pool was small but ok. Yakuzzi normal but so chlorinated, salt water, with a child we ran away. The dry sauna small on the current, does not give the desired effect. Don't touch the shower in the pool. Rusty, dirty fuck. There's a TV with underwater nature films in the pool - it's cool. Of course, there's stairs everywhere, and we're with a pram. We go to the restaurant and there at least a nice surprise - good food. If someone does not like the Germans, who Non Stop say that it's their land and etc . Let them choose other places in Poland. Generally, the neighborhood is nice, the town of mrągoville is nice. But for the second time I will not fall for nice pictures . I do not recommend it, because you will regret it."
1230,"I am very pleased with the mammotomic biopsy performed by Dr Bednarski . Admittedly, the procedure is expensive, I am glad that I decided to have this biopsy and not to surgically remove a mild breast tumor. The scar is really small and has spared me a stressful stay in the hospital. However, I have some reservations about the offices in Sanivitas: there is no screen or even a curtain that the patient could take off her clothes for examination or treatment. You simply take off your clothes in front of the desk, behind which the doctor sits, or by the chair at the door. I also didn't like the rush to admit patients: after the examination, the doctor referred me with all questions to the nurses at registration. After the procedure, when I was frantically dressed on the chair by the door, he already discussed the case of the next patient. I still had the impression that the doctor was in a great hurry and that I should jump out of my bra as soon as possible and then jump into it.) I know it's just a small thing, but it's a little discomfort. I have absolutely no objections to the ladies' nurses: they have always been very nice, kind, patient and ready to help. It is much easier for women to feel the position of the patients who have to undergo any treatment on their breasts: )"
1231,"The hotel when it comes to decorating nothing. Right by the beautiful beach with free sun loungers . Unfortunately, it has a couple of downsides, the first one is: a bar which is located very far from the beach. 2 . The food is still the same, i.e. some pork or chicken in some sauce - nothing tasty. 3 . The waitress did not want to spend more alcohol for one person who had an all-inclusive bracelet because the boss ""looks"" (e.g. one person wanted to take a 2 / 3 beer to not walk often, cannot) 4 . Alcohol up to 23 : 00, then up to 0 : 00 paid. 5 . A small bar, when you were sitting at the reception, because there were tables there too, the boss did not like it. 6 . When we sat down at the bar for too long, we turned off the lights because it was time for them to go to sleep. I certainly do not recommend this hotel to anyone! I am only satisfied with the location of the beach and that is all : )"
1232,"The truth is that the doctor is a pretty and very well-groomed woman. And I think that's her only advantage. I'm not gonna talk about the treatment because I've only been with her once. I was signed up for a specific time, I waited 46 minutes for her to take me in (ok, I understand there are a lot of patients). She asked me what was going on, so I tried to tell her about my problem, but all the time she interrupted me, she looked at my watch. It wasn't much to talk about because it was my first visit to the doctor's office. - An endocrinologist. I really just wanted to check and take a referral, because only after the examination the doctor can make a diagnosis, it's logical. She wrote me a referral and thanked me for the visit. . . I asked what about the examination. She said she has so many patients that she can't examine me at the moment to come at another time. So I went to another doctor, who had time to talk to me and, above all, examine me. So my feelings are negative. Reading the patients' opinions I think I may have gone through my misfortune to miss her bad day, but paying so much money for the visit expects something more than treating her like this."
1234,"Mrs. A. Kalita was nice and answered all my questions about the problem that puzzled me, even though it was not directly related to the reason for the visit. She took advantage of the sandblast cleaning package which, as usual, brought positive aesthetic changes - I recommend it, especially since, compared to other Krakow offices, its price is affordable."
1235,"He would advise me to avoid this hotel. The staff has still the customs and mentality of remembering the old times you are, you are not interested in it. Apart from the manager who tried to make up for something, I didn't meet a kind worker who wanted to make my stay more pleasant. The only one was a cleaner. Even breakfast was saved on the waffle machines on display. The internet sucks. You have to ask for a reminder and supposedly there is nothing you can do according to the reception. The hotel's reaction to all my remarks was that it was only on the day of my departure that someone wanted to meet with me and talk to me. it's so that the hotel wouldn't cost much."
1236,"We went to Zalesie with the help of opinions collected from the Internet, to my surprise practically only good ones. . . Our arrival in this place took place in the autumn. There were not many clients, maybe that's why they were saving money at every step! ! ! Sauna without steam, swimming pool with icy water - it was hard to get my underage child wet in it, with barely any of us able to stand in it. In the room we had to turn the radiator on our own. In the bathrooms fish. The food was good, but not very varied. Very nice gentleman you could meet in the restaurant . He saved the whole, average hotel atmosphere. And so in the end, the worst thing that will leave no taste my forever to this place is the price! ! Absolutely not adequate to what you will find there. . . I won't recommend this place to anyone."
1237,"About the last opinion - and don't you think the doctor is here to tell the patient what's wrong? A colleague came to your gynecologist with severe pain, so what would she ask? She wanted to know what was wrong with her, the pain doesn't come from nowhere and just because you're satisfied with your gynaecologist doesn't mean we all have to be satisfied."
1238,"I highly recommend the Doctor. He led my entire pregnancy. He ordered a detailed examination, each visit was very thorough and sensitive, and in particular I was given answers to the questions asked. Since I was at risk of getting pregnant and unfortunately I had to lie in the hospital several times, I think that thanks to the immediate reaction of the doctor I can now enjoy motherhood."
1239,"The hotel is quite big, you have to overlap a bit, but still worth a visit. The food is excellent, a big choice for lunch or dinner, for breakfast standard. The rooms are spacious, clean, we were with two children and were comfortable. An undoubted attraction are the swimming pools. There are a few for smaller or larger children to choose from, and our children liked the pool most the sea shore-like look, where every few minutes waves were created. Just like at the seaside. Of course, slides, jacuzzi with different types of water (iodized, boron, etc.) For children, the attraction is also a large playground, a lot of toys, a lot of cottages or horsement-riders, games, blocks, swings, is what to do in case of bad weather."
1240,"The hotel from outside looks very decent. Unfortunately, from the inside it is not so colourful. Plaster falling off the walls, jammed elevators, a badly functioning lock in the bathroom, slow water coming off the shower trays, broken wallpaper in the corridors, broken balcony doors, food not tasty and spent very slowly, missing billiard tickets, water in the pool too chlorinated, curved tracks to the vertebrae, and, worst of all, the staff, which is extremely splashing. I myself have experienced the rudeness of the receptionist when, after getting jammed in the elevator, I was freed from it by this lady, after leaving, the first thing he heard 'em from this very displeasing woman was ""do you have to nap * * * * * * * * in this bell"" . I don't recommend this hotel with all my heart. Greetings."
1241,"She bought me a little without thinking on the Internet because of a small child. Unfortunately, my husband has already found a few small drawbacks: - expensive consumables (it's worth to be interested BEFORE buying) - very high energy consumption up to 150W - modern humidifiers with this capacity consume less than 30W! ! ! - mineral deposits falling on furniture and other equipment - 25dB is not quiet - modern humidifiers with this capacity operate in the range of 14 - 21dB! ! ! - beware of the bacterial aerosol that comes out of the humidifier, if the water is not changed every day! ! ! Generally, it is worth considering ."
1242,"I do not recommend ! This gentleman in 20 weeks of pregnancy found me a baby ! After reporting that I often have wet orthotics, he stated that at this stage of pregnancy, foetal water cannot leak. Or maybe. Besides that, he did not refer me to any examination or consultation with another doctor! He stated that the cause of the baby is not known or there are no methods of treatment and he let me go home with nothing! After an hour of reading she had more knowledge about the baby than Dr. Laganowski. The next day, after consultation with another doctor, I was lying on the pathology of pregnancy. I do not recommend"
1243,"I'm surprised by all these positive comments. In the case of my child the doctor did not work out, moreover by her you have to start the treatment again. Perhaps she has managed to guide several patients well (choose the right drugs, etc.). I have a very bad experience with Ms. Młodzińska. ( I will certainly never recommend her to anyone. Feeding a man with nice words is no help."
1244,"Pools ok, eating ok, practically no beach, unfortunately the lack of animation in the hotel for families with children is a big problem, especially since they were advertised. The hotel is located on the side of the village, 20 minutes walk to the center. Good starting point for exploring the whole island by car."
1245,"I was satisfied with the course of treatment, but unfortunately, I was disappointed at the very end when I got a faulty retention pad (the upper one jumped out and the lower one was wrongly made and could not be inserted) and the lady didn't want to meet me to correct it, but she sent me to the nearest dental office to have it wired to me, as a result of which they want to put on my braces for the second time today : ("
1246,"it's never been this way for everyone to be satisfied with the same doctor. Everyone has different requirements and not always a doctor who suits others suits us . Some praise a doctor, others are dissatisfied with him. This is about all specialties. As in any other profession this teacher we like that we hate this saleswoman is nice and this one is not. The doctor once spoke on TV about this site. The doctors do not care at all about these opinions, those who go to him will go regardless of whether someone else is satisfied with his work . I think maybe the doctor had a worse day than any of us have. You can't force a positive opinion on someone else if she had a negative event. Personally, I'm going with the child to see Dr. Bishop. Kośmicka and I'm very pleased with her approach to work, maybe someone thinks otherwise and I have no right to forbid it. Our feelings are individual."
1247,"With a clear conscience, I can recommend Dr. Frank. We are parents of a 3-year-old son. The whole pregnancy was led by Dr. Franik and we are very happy with it. Although he was going on vacation, he handed me over to his friend Dr. Dąbrowski (head of the gynaecology and obstetrics ward in the Railway Hospital in Katowice). Despite the fact that I am not from Katowice, I prefer to go there rather than go to doctors in my city although I have a county hospital on the spot, but what if I have high quality equipment in the hospital like doctors don't know anything about it as it is in the county hospital in Mikołów. Dr. Franik directs to all the examinations and explains everything in detail. If the pregnancy is proceeding properly visits are once a month and not like other doctors every 2 weeks. It is only a pity that good specialists have to be so dear, but sometimes it is worth to pay more and to sleep peacefully without worrying that there may be something wrong with the child. The next pregnancy will surely also be led by Dr Franik because I can trust him. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CARING CARE."
1248,"This is our favorite place in the Giant Mountains, so we are biased. The cuisine is excellent (fantastic trout or Hungarian cake), delicious honey beer from our own brewery and the palace is getting nicer. This time we only used the restaurant, but next time we will also stay in the hotel again. We will come back many times."
1249,"Positive opinions after the visit to cardiology , Ms . Aneta Stachurska Przychodnia Specjalistyczna - Wrocław , ul . Legnicka 61 . I was visited by Mrs . Aneta Stachurska with cardiac problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. I was given an accurate diagnosis and correctly changed my hypertension drugs. She was sure that nothing important about my heart condition was missing. When I was performing an adequate diagnosis, I received an exceptional professionalism and reliability of the doctor. With full conviction I recommend her! I hope that all specialists have such an approach to the patient. She left the office with great gratitude, thanks a lot."
1250,"The staff moves like flies in pitch, the customer is indifferent! I agree with the predecessors, the name has not much in common with a restaurant. At lunchtime, few guests and here a warning light came on, flew me through the dishes and I was not interested in anything, such food is not very much, so we resigned and went to another more eye friendly place!"
1251,"I wonder why so many positive opinions (as a result of which we found ourselves here). There is no climate - unless you like stations, because e.g. a place with sofas at the bar resembles a waiting room at the airport. You sit terribly, with a backrest up to 1 / 3 back. The alternative is to sit on chairs at a table in the restaurant area, which resembles a common room. There's no place to spend time with a drink, and there's a space where they could arrange it. A sensible armchairs, sofas and light not from the aquarium will suffice. Fluorescent lamps add to the feeling of opacity. What's more - you will also find this type / colour of light in your room! No room mute, you can participate in the conversations of neighbors. Uncomfortable beds, Ikea microscopic pillows. The tap over the washbasin was invented especially to knock out your eyes and smash your forehead? There is a railway embankment on the reception side and trains are running. Breakfast - just ok, usually a hotel breakfast. Coffee other than black - to order in the bar. The courteous gentleman makes good omelets. Positive is certainly the service - nice, at the reception or the bar - all helpful. To sum up, probably the second worst place we've been in. And unfortunately, this is not a bad hotel in general! In my opinion, a terrible number of mistakes were made in the project and this was not corrected during the implementation. As if the people who did it never used good hotels in Poland or abroad."
1252,"The hotel is tastefully and modernly equipped. Great location ( 200 meters from the sea ) . Delicious and varied meals (no repeat of the soup for 10 days). Tea, coffee and water with fresh herbs are available all day free of charge in the restaurant. Every day the rooms are cleaned. There is a small swimming pool with counterflow and massage jets. Towels and bathrobes are available free of charge. Very nice and always willing to help. In the restaurant, you can hear very much like chillout music. I recommend it, it rested well, I felt ""taken care of"" . The hotel is so small that the atmosphere is very nice. I think I'll come back here again."
1253,"Yesterday was my first visit. A positive impression, nice, with a sense of humor. Indeed, he explained everything to me, what you see on the ultrasound, how we will proceed further, he drew me all over the page. He was the only doctor who paid attention to something that no one has ever paid attention to so far. I hope I will soon have a baby. I am very pleased. I was on a private visit to Legionowo, the cash register rather did not tear off, standard. I recommend it."
1254,"The lowest percentage of foreign tourists was recorded in typical holiday facilities. In the period from January to June 2012, the occupancy rate at all tourist accommodation facilities was 30.6%. . The best results were recorded in health resorts - 72% . . The lowest utilisation in these facilities was observed in January 2012 . (61.6% . ), i.e. 15.9%, 9 p . p . less than in June, when the occupancy rate of beds in health resorts was 77.5% . . The occupancy rate of beds in hotel facilities in the first half of 2012 was 31.0%. This is exactly the same as in the first half of 2011. In the case of other facilities (non-hotel facilities), this ratio decreased from 32.3% to 30.1%. . In the first half of 2012 the number of tourists using accommodation facilities increased by 3.6%. In the first half of 2012 the number of tourists using accommodation facilities increased by 3.6%, the number of nights spent by 1.1% and the number of rooms rented by 5.0% in relation to the period from January to June 2011. The study also examined guest rooms / private accommodation and agritourism farms with 10 or more beds."
1255,"According to the IŻ research, there are from about 2 to about 3 percent of trans-fatty acids in butter available on the Polish market. ""In dairy products from ruminant animals, such as cows and sheep, they cannot be eliminated. Their content in butter varies depending on the feed used for feeding during the year and may vary from 1 to 8%. "" explains Prof. Mojska. Larger amounts of trans isomers have been found in the so-called fat mixes, i.e. those using different types of fats, both of plant and animal origin (it can be a mixture of butter with vegetable oils or margarine with milk)."
1256,"Pain doctor very nice, on a high level, however, in my case the diagnosis is not correct. The drug as well as the means to care for the skin is selected. The condition after the treatment has neither worsened nor improved. It was helped by visiting another doctor and administering another medication, after which after two applications the problem started to disappear. However, I realize that dermatology is a lottery, one drug does not work for everyone and sometimes you have to try something else, but I judge the visit by my experience."
1257,"I was tempted by this guesthouse because I needed a cheap place to stay in Poznan for three days. Even considering that I am an experienced traveler and I like Spartan lifestyle, this place was the worst I have ever stayed in. The staff did not know a single word of English and communicated with me via text messages, asking me when I was leaving and telling me where to leave my keys ... The cell I was assigned was opposite the bathroom and every time to get there I had to go through the reception. It's not very nice to take a shower or go to the toilet. The furniture was cheap Ikei style furniture and the squeaky bed didn't let me sleep a wink the first night. The next night, I put 'em on the ground. Then I realized that the broken glass had been swept under the bed - the cleaning staff didn't really care, could have been lying there for a long time and quite possibly still lying there. The worst (and most ridiculous) adventure happened when em came back after a day in town and found a big crowd in front of the building. One of the guests locked himself in. After 50 minutes, the owner showed up, went in through the back window and opened the front door. He was already quite tired then (it takes 35 minutes on foot from the market square to the hotel) and thanked 'em for the mattress on the floor. I wasn't thinking of a riot in the street (a Chinese restaurant a few houses away and a night shop) that wouldn't let me sleep for even a minute. If you're not used to sleeping in the jungle and don't feel like having a nasty adventure, avoid this place at all costs. You've been warned."
1258,"Welcome back ! 5 wonderful days . . . We came back here a second time and we will come back for sure ! Hotel on the level ! No objections! Top level service ! The best congratulations for the selection of the staff, a special appreciation for the waitress, who was at dinner every day. We will also remember the apartment and wish you a return to health heh . The President will exchange a nice word with every guest. . . Nothing to add to it. Ah... . . Breakfast prepared for the trip is delicious! Thank you and greetings ! Konrad with his wife . . . . . Room 131"
1259,"In the prevention of Alzheimer's disease it is important to treat atherosclerosis, atherosclerotic changes in the cerebral arteries go hand in hand with the process of Alzheimer's disease, these diseases intermingle. It has been proven that damaged vessels are an additional source of beta amyloid in the brain. The necrosis caused by ischemia and hypoxia must not be allowed. Prevention also includes treatment of hypertension, diabetes, heart rhythm disorders. Physical activity must be an essential part of our daily schedule, researchers suggest long, fast daily marches. A rich social life is a good exercise for the mind as well as intellectual activity, challenging ourselves (learning new languages is better than going back to the ones we already know). A Mediterranean diet is advisable."
1260,"Although there is no hotel operating in the Netherlands after the Hyatt brand, it has its own ""room"" in the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. The ""Hyatt Room"" currently features a selection of contemporary art works, including ""Femme nue devant le jardin"" by Pablo Picasso ""Fingermalerei - AKT"" by Georg Baselitz, ""Velazquez"" by Franz West and ""Painting , Smoking , Eating"" and ""The Door"" by Philip Gustons. According to Paul Geertman of Aedes Real Estate, the owner of the building where the Andaz Hotel was opened, the cooperation with the museum highlights the links between the new facility and the Hyatt Hotels chain and art. Andaz is a luxury brand of boutique hotels that is part of the Hyatt Hotels and Resorts chain."
1261,"The game is as good as the previous parts of Gran Turismo. Graphics, sound, playability at a very high level. It's also not short, I went through it in a month of playing. This is not a demo, but a prologue, which is an announcement of what awaits us in the main game, Gran Turismo 5. There are about 70 cars, only the tracks are few, because 6 . There are small errors in the game, such as graphical errors while driving. Besides, the game unfortunately sometimes slows down. I hope that these minor bugs will be fixed and will not be in the full version of the game. Mandatory title for the third plebeian."
1262,"The hotel is difficult for me to judge, because on the one hand it has a very good location, it is clean, they serve delicious breakfast (nice ladies waitresses) and the price is not comfortable, but a one-hour stay in the ""Piascie"" will completely spoil my reception staff. The hotel staff on the phone inform that they can order a taxi for me from the airport, but they need an order by e-mail. I send out the necessary information twice, the case even goes to the management before they graciously receive the order confirmation email and an apology. By the way, all the ""confusion"" I have to listen to information like, ""I don't know what happened 3 days ago, I'm just starting work. The taxi arrives on time, it seems to be a completely random, one-time incident. Late at night I check into the hotel, I order a wake-up call for the early morning of the next day. Luckily, by some miracle, I wake up alone because nobody at the reception desk woke me up. To the complaint I receive a nonchalant answer from the gentleman who is at the reception desk, that he didn't actually wake me up - he is sorry, but he was busy at work (!) and that if he really slept, he would pay me back for the lost connection. I do not know what to call it - total arrogance? ?"
1263,"The same thing is true for parking: in some of the facilities parking is free, in others you have to pay extra. In practice, additional fees can be charged for many services. It depends mainly on what the owner promotes in his facility and the offer of the competition. The fees for Internet access or free of charge are another difference in the approach to additional services,"" explains Jacek Piast, hotel advisor. In his opinion, in Poland, fortunately for the guests, the character of the activity provided by the hotels is ""old Polish hospitality"". as well as the subconscious ""Orbisian patterns"". The breakthrough in this awareness is that hoteliers often use hotels abroad. Not holiday hotels, but business hotels. In these facilities, one either buys an expensive room with a package of additional services or a cheaper room, agreeing to pay extra charges for the use of ""additional"" services: air-conditioning, TV, internet access, minibar, mineral water, coffee set, ironers, and even services provided by the reception desk, such as waking up (waking up for free can then be set in the TV set). A fee is also sometimes charged for the order by the reception of a taxi."
1264,"I am very pleased with the rest of this hotel. The service is very nice and polite. Daily salty beds and fresh towels. Breakfast is rich and tasty (unfortunately no tomato vegetables, lettuce). Close to the metro and shopping mall. The only drawback in my case was the fact that the windows were facing a noisy street and at night they had to be closed."
1265,"It was my second and last stay in this hotel. Previous one - ok . 3 years ago it was very successful - the level of service at the highest level but now only a memory remains - a room tight, leaking windows, a bathroom with an uninteresting smell, barely lukewarm water in the tap. The canteen is open for 2 hours but the food starts to run out after just half an hour and nobody from the service of their own free will complements anything - you have to ask for everything - even water for tea. The other side is that once the dishes were very tasty and varied - now the chef has probably got a roundup. Recreation - a swimming pool with cold water and in the Jacuzzi you can boil yourself. For three bowling lanes operated only one (and in the hotel more than 100 rooms), a tennis table scratched with barely holding the net. The only advantage is the location of the hotel."
1266,Hello and I warn you to visit the hotel conditions as for such a price massacre shower cubicles not domtested are the best plastic teaspoons after ice cream as for the standard shame for the castle that it still works if you want to take a bath better please have your towel because unfortunately you have to pay for it because as the cleaning lady said it was very dirty from hair dye and is not suitable but What a brazen virgin who can't clean (the towel went to a laundry room we know where it was was washed and perfectly white but you had to pay the embarrassment) we will not recommend this hotel to anyone waitresses in the bar probably had a bad day because just looking at them would kill them and we do not greet the manager who does the selection of guests if it's foreigners is great for them all and we will sit quietly. The worst hotel we've been in
1267,"Very poor service, you are extremely unpleasant at the reception desk and generally do not know your role in relation to the customer. The swimming pool and other attractions during my stay were not available before. 2 points for a comfortable room but not very comfortable bathroom ."
1268,"After reading such flattering opinions, she made an appointment with her child to visit Dr. Dorota Rutkowska . And frankly, she was very disappointed in me. She imagined the visit to the dentist, who treats small children, especially those with high level of anxiety, in a completely different way. After entering the dentist's office with the child, we did not even have time to adapt, and the teeth inspection and treatment was done in a forceful way. The doctor did not try at all to talk to the child, smile, explain what she was going to do - she just did what she was going to do, regardless of the horror, screams and cries of the child. The atmosphere so she didn't belong to a pleasant one. Well, that this nightmare is already behind us and I can definitely say that we will never use Dr. Rutkowska again. I sincerely advise against it."
1269,"Revenue per available room is almost 17 euros lower than the European average and almost 26 euros lower than the leader, Western Europe. This means that it was more than half as much. The performance of hotels in our part of Europe is in line with the positive European growth trend we experienced last year. The whole of Europe, on the other hand, performs equally well in comparison to other regions. Room utilization is only 0.5% lower than that of Asia and Oceania and the growth of this indicator puts our continent behind the Americas."
1270,"If you are looking for something of good standard, let go of this hotel! The rooms are two-star, old and ugly. The food will get away - the chef does his best, but there are rather poor products available. They don't even serve butter, just margarine. After a few days, it gets very tiring. The rooms lack water for guests - you have to stand in line for a cup of drink. Three swimming pools are more like ponds, where children are drowning. And here is another remark - if you are going on vacation in search of peace and quiet, here you will not realize it. You are not allowed to eat on the terrace, so when you eat, you will be accompanied by outbreaks of crying and screaming of children (just do not choose a hotel recommended for families with children:) We felt like we were dining in the dining room like a railway station during rush hours. A nice aspect here are the animators - really cordial and amazing, very nice performances, but the little children had to literally chase them off the stage every night, they are everywhere (but this is our mistake - we did not pay attention to the character of the hotel). The rooms are cleaned daily, the staff is nice. Besides, I recommend the island itself - it is beautiful, crystal sea, beautiful views and silence (outside our hotel)."
1271,"Friends ! Your complaining that the doctor gives you little information, has no time, does not have the time, does it in a hurry - it also proves your approach to the visit. I also had a problem with it - with the previous doctor, very reticent and rough. Then she changed my profession and my doctor into a salesman. And here a bit from another barrel. I learned to ask questions during training sessions for salespeople in such a way as to get a specific answer and not just a simple yes or no. And I also use this tactic with Dr. Nobleman because I see how many patients are behind me and in front of me, and how much I pay in the waist. That is why I require from him exhaustive answers. I am also prepared for this visit, I respect him and my time - I ask specific questions and do not play cat and mouse. If I don't understand something, I ask. It's a girl's act. The doctor remembers me, my ailments and already knows that I expect an honest conversation. If they taught him that he can sell you out with a 2-minute examination and a prescription, it's partly your fault too. I'm still a patient. The downside is that it's actually delayed visits, the price. Plus - he diagnosed me after 5 minutes of conversation and the examination confirmed his assumptions! ! ! We are waiting for the transfer of 3 embryos - it is in a few days! ! ! I'll give you a super positive evaluation if it works : )"
1272,"My opinion about the hotel really varies between bad and medium. I spent my holidays with my family ( 2 adults and two small children ) and this is certainly not a hotel for families with children as it was marked in the offer . Pool not suitable for children quite deep hopeless descent . The playground is beautiful in the pictures and completely not functional because it is located all day long in the sun without a canopy and so no one uses it unless after dark. I confirm that the roosters are drinking not mercifully confirm that the food is monotonous, tasteless 3 species and any cheap products. If the breakfasts, let's say, were quite enough to swallow, then after 3 days the dinners went out sideways - it's better to eat out. Rooms are badly cleaned, cursory by not very nice cleaners who even invite guests out of the room and clean as it is comfortable for them and not for guests. The main building is the showcase of the hotel and so it is beautiful and mega clean. In the rooms are old beds with mega hard mattresses you can literally spend a few sleepless nights. The hotel's total sum is not worth the price and if it wasn't for the cute waiters who made up for the rest, you could say that the staff was also hopeless - especially the reception."
1273,"Let's start with positives : - Karpacz and fresh air : ) - Weather ( January / February 2014 ) - wonderful view of Sniezka from the window - reasonable price ( Groupon ) - a nice welcome to the receptionist - clean, well-kept rooms, bathroom standard very high and at the end. . . . - Rooms are either extremely hot or cold - you can hear what the neighbor is doing on the first floor below, no noise, the door slams, general like a dorm. - Far away from the city (you can descend the Raven Rocks but on your own responsibility during the day and soberly or go down the intricate roads underneath for about 40 minutes). - If you have an intense day, climbing Snow White or other climbing, forget about making up for the hunger at dinner, the portions are minimally funny, as for children (a spoonful of potatoes, a bit of salad and chicken as if starving), you have to make up for the lack of carbohydrates with food in the city, - forget about the desire to order additional food (the desire to eat a portion of fries ended with the fact that we were informed about washing the fryer (hour). 17 : 00) and if necessary we can use the pizza on the command. . . . . .because the guesthouse has casseroles, but they are too big for the oven. . . . . .without comment. . . - Breakfast, just for those trained in the struggle for leftover food, that is, if you get up when the dawn is you eat, then forget about adding food. Yoghurts from Ladybirds, emaciated cheeses, vegetables are probably only for dreamers who get up at 8 am because from 9 am there is nothing anymore, staff not interested in shortages, with a cane will cook some diluted coffee. To sum up, stay for the minimalists, satisfied with the old ham and cheese because if you are counting on it, with buying the full package will eat like a man you are thickly mistaken. Eating out or starving, that's your choice. To test your own skin for hardcore. The most important thing is that you can be sure that you will be able to get a full package of food for a week, but you can also get a full package of food for a week. Because the facility is different from a youth hostel only that, with sleeping on the bed and is clean."
1274,"Beautiful location, right on the cape. From the balcony, view of the lighthouse and the sea side. To the beach 100m but a steep descent (not suitable for prams). Apartments very well equipped, clean, large and pleasant. Outside there is a large playground, barbecue area and a year-round swimming pool (you have to go outside). Inside there is a Jacuzzi and a small corner for children. To the center of Jastrzębia Góra it takes 3 minutes, to Władysławowo 10 minutes. Prices in the off-season are affordable, less in the season. . . The only downside - very poor wifi. I recommend the place!"
1275,"Very nice and factual, doctor. She commissioned a number of studies, answered all the questions and conducted an in-depth interview herself. A very big plus for a fantastic bathroom, equipped with everything that should be at the disposal of the patient in the gynecological office. Unfortunately, at each of my visits, the delay was about an hour, and recently even one lady had an appointment for the same hour as me."
1276,"Meanwhile, a team from American Stanford and California Universities and the AGH University of Science and Technology (AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow) is working to ensure that in the future the implants will allow for more accurate vision. Researchers want the implant to use much smaller electrodes, which will be densely packed - instead of a few dozen electrodes it will be possible to place several thousand of them on the retina. This will make the image more detailed. In addition, the researchers want the pulses from one electrode to be very precise and reach individual ganglion cells, not thousands at a time. Another challenge is to improve the impulses that the electrode sends to the retinal cell. ""What we see at all times is a very complex scene. It is difficult for us to encode it as the eye does,"" says the scientist. He explains that there are up to 20 different types of ganglion cells in the retina - other cells are responsible for processing and sending information about colour to the brain and others about movement. So if the entire area of retinal cells is stimulated, different types of retinal cells are stimulated simultaneously, so that the brain can receive conflicting signals in an instant."
1277,"Mrs. Turowska treated me very badly, she examined me very gently, and when she drew my attention to her, she said that of all the doctors she knows, she is the nicest and the most gentle and she did not exaggerate me. She didn't give me enough time and she felt like she wanted to sell me out as soon as possible, she didn't even leave enough time to think about the questions I want to ask her, only if it's all right to see you. . . I hope not, I'll never go to her myself again and I don't recommend it to others either."
1278,"It may have been nice here in the past years, but now it's just wrong. The location may be interesting for some because it is close to the graduation tower, but all day and half the night there is noise on the boardwalk and on the other side of the hotel there is a constant whirring of passing cars. A complete lack of intimacy. It is impossible to sleep because of not only the noise but above all the super uncomfortable, soft mattresses, packed cushions, etc. Besides, a room with . k . It is a pity that there is no fridge. The service, however, is unsatisfactory, in the reception desk it is usually empty, and when you arrive, it is unwanted. The kitchen is criticized, breakfast is still the same, to be bored, in the restaurant the waiters sometimes forget to serve the ordered dish, and the chef, if there is one, is a tragedy!"
1279,"Course: Technology and Civilization An interesting subject, a lecturer really ok, no problem with passing. It pays to go to the lectures (you can get simple questions) and get additional advantages that will help in giving the grade. Once again, I highly recommend"
1280,"We were at the hotel for 2 weeks in early July with a small child. Holidays turned out to be very successful. The hotel is located about 400 m from the beautiful beaches, especially the wild beach of Hovolo, where it is located until about 1 pm. 00 is a shadow from the rocks, so the son could play in the shade. Besides, the island of Skopelos has enchanted us with its wild nature, it is worth visiting traditional towns and villages, there are very few hotels and tourists on the island. It is worth renting a car for a few days. The hotel is neat and clean, the room is cleaned daily, the towels are changed on a regular basis. The swimming pool was not used by us because we preferred the beaches. The food was tasty, varied and fresh. The downside was that when a dish ended up, we had to wait 10 minutes for them to report it. Meals are served outdoors, which attracts wasps. OSY interfere with the food, I do not recommend the hotel to a person allergic to bites. Besides, the stay was successful. The Rainbow office organized interesting animations for children. Maybe one day we will come back: )"
1281,"The doctor is nice, but not very gentle and unfortunately in my case she made me constantly feel terrible pain, which she had never felt before before. Additionally, she saw my lower even teeth so crookedly under the crowns that it is far from the notion of aesthetic dentistry and even more so the comfort of living. Unfortunately, ""Prophylaxis of caries treatment"" is usually an encouragement for unnecessary treatment and it is also very expensive. I regret that she consulted me about what the doctor said with another dentist. She would have probably avoided the pain that continues to this day after treatment in the office. After putting on the crowns for which I had to have healthy teeth, after only a few months during one of the inspections she said that I have caries on other teeth, which unfortunately she cured me. And in this way, the doctor made my whole bite change, my jaw still hurts all the time, I can't bite my usual meals, not to mention hard products, and these ""cured"" teeth hurt constantly since they were ""cured from caries"". ...for more than a few months. In order to improve the aesthetics of the two upper teeth, the doctor also damaged a few healthy teeth at the bottom and said that this ""normal"" preparation for crowns. I regret that she agreed to it and let me file down because it changed my bite and she didn't think it would be such a big interference in my teeth and such a strong sawing of my early straight teeth which are now crooked and sore because the doctor wanted to do it as soon as possible and not the best. Before this whole treatment she did not feel any pain and after the ""treatment"" I still feel it. She would rather give this money away for free than treat it again in the doctor's office. Despite many corrections, the doctor was not able to fix my teeth. Treatment here is the worst decision I have made, which unfortunately I will have to deal with for a long time. I suggest that you consult the treatment plan recommended by the doctor with another dentist, preferably trusted. I unfortunately found myself here by accident and I certainly do not want to go back there. I don't recommend it."
1282,"In the case of recreational stays, free Wi - Fi is such a factor for 34% of respondents . Whereas 66% of respondents would like free Wi Fi to become a standard in all hotels in 2013. Free Internet access is much more important for both business guests and tourists than free parking or breakfast. In total, only 11% of those surveyed said they would be willing to pay for Wi Fi during their stay in the hotel. According to Kate Hopcraftof from Hotels.com, such a strong emphasis on free Wi Fi is primarily due to the fact that guests expect the hotel to continue the approach they encounter during their travels - free Internet offers more and more airlines, airports and catering establishments."
1283,"I sincerely recommend Marcin . He's a professional in every way. I reported to him with a serious radial nerve paralysis (Saturday night syndrome - falling wrist, lack of finger rectifiers' activity) . The EMG examination showed neurapraxia/axonotmesis type damage and the neurologist assessed that the first muscle activity would appear after about . 9 months after the injury . The first meeting with Marcin took place after about . 1, 5 months after the injury and after that the first improvement appeared. With each subsequent meeting it was only better. After 10 meetings the hand returned to full fitness! Many months before the expected recovery. Marcin has a very positive attitude towards the patient and gives valuable tips. He also cares about the patient's opinion, which makes the therapy an effective cooperation and leads to rapid improvement of health."
1284,"Hopeless hotel service. Breakfast as in an average hotel. The cost of stay absolutely too high, saunas ok but nothing else. Ladies working at the reception desk not polite at all. Information on the Internet completely different than at the reception."
1285,"I unfortunately have a negative experience of the visit. In my opinion, from the very beginning, em was added and the ""doctor"" was behaving in a very rough way. On the one hand, she claimed that she knows nothing about me, on the other hand, under the influence of emotions, she repeated that I am ""psychosocially underdeveloped"". On my delicate suggestion that if I had been with Asperger's syndrome, I would have a reduced insight into my emotions and the doctor would analyze them well and said that he knows nothing about me. If he does not know why he makes such a diagnosis? No specialist has made such a diagnosis before, but the doctor did not know the case. I also think that the doctor does not understand the essence of obsessive neurosis and cannot distinguish it from other unrelated issues in sexual diagnosis. And this belongs to the basic diagnostics . I do not even want to describe the whole course of the visit . I only feel sorry for the 180 PLN spent."
1286,"Whether or not he is a homeopath, I would advise against it. Apparently everything's OK, but. . . . . He behaves in a good way and treats his parents from above. He loves to teach and praise morals. He asks for things until he finds something he can get attached to. Contact with the child is kept to a minimum. It seems as if she is tired of this work. My two colleagues who were with Dr. Dr. had very similar impressions and one of them even cried (Dr. Dr. accused her of taking poor care of the child)."

1288,"The lecturer noted that almost every substance, if abused, has negative effects - the same is true of marijuana. It was found that shortly after use, it weakens motor and cognitive functions - e.g. it slows down the reflexes - so it is rightly banned in many countries to drive after cannabis is burned. The substance also impairs short-term memory - so smoking a joint, e.g. before a university exam, can have fatal consequences for students. However, data quoted by a Krakow neuropharmacologist (from the 1990s) indicate that less than 10% of cannabis smokers become permanently dependent on it. In the light of these data, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol and amphetamine have much stronger addictive effects."

Already in this period there was a great difficulty with swallowing saliva and food. To fall asleep at night she had to take 2 tablets of Ibuprom or Diclo Duo Combi. After the interview and examination of ears, nose, throat, diagnosis: vocal cords redness on the left side, probably a virus, treatment: Clindamycin - MIP, Groprinosin . On 21 . 01 . 2018 the pain is very intense and radiates intensely to the left arm . Second visit on 02 . 02 . 2018 acute pain and only left side . Repetition of Clindamycin drugs - MIP , Groprinosin , because the virus can pass to the lungs . . On 09 . 02 . 2018 with these pains I reported to another doctor after my interview and examination Mr. Dr .

On 17 . 02 . 2018 is much better . Next visit to Mr . on 19 . 02 . 2018r . Evaluation for Dr . Molga is very low, lack of professional intuition, measuring patients with one measure, because in this period many people come with such types of pain, when they are as diagnosed as I am, I sympathize with them. , ,"
1293,"We were at this doctor's with a 2.5 year old son with symptoms of uncontrolled movements occurring suddenly and lasting several dozen seconds. During the visit the doctor did not move from behind the desk, did not examine the small patient neurologically, but diagnosed that the symptoms are the result of the fact that the son can not cope with the emotions, that we should praise him more. During the conversation he lifted up his apron and loosened his trouser belt (reflex?), which surprised us a bit. At the end of the visit he told his son to stand with his feet joined, pull out his hands in front of him and move each finger separately (the 2, 5-year-old did not understand the order). He wrote in his opinion that the neurological examination was normal (I do not know on what basis, if he did not examine the son), he recommended prevention / observation. We went to another pediatric neurologist, the son has been diagnosed with a condition not based on controlling emotions and is undergoing treatment. I SINCERELY ADVISE AGAINST THIS DOCTOR!"
1294,"We drove over 230km and bought an autumn package which was not one of the cheapest. Upon arrival, it turned out that with a rich buffet dinner left a choice from the card, ok you could expect to stay from Sunday to Tuesday few people, etc . The food does not go crazy, such as excluding soups where the herrings are almost not salted fish, the evening spent in the room because everything is only open until 9 p.m. so the other day we ordered bowling from the package, there was to be a drink and the evening in the pub scheduled and here at 5 p.m. the lady calls from the reception that we can not take advantage of this because the group arrived and occupies the whole pub so it stays sitting in the room! ! ! ! So we left on the same day because this is not how our trip was supposed to look like. The resort has not fulfilled its contract, it sells something that it can not provide, we were deceived by promises, and you could inform us that it will be such a situation that it would choose a different date. We will certainly not recommend your facility where guests are treated as a necessary evil just to pay the money! ! !"

1296,"I came across your doctor by accident - the first and second visit as a replacement for another doctor went without any reservations. As the doctor she chose was often on the road, she prescribed me to Dr. Michalak. I am a person who is reluctant to share opinions online, but frankly speaking, to this day I am confused and confused by the doctor's approach. At first she thought she had a tongue in her mouth - after all, hypotheticality and overactivity are near-sounding words. On her third visit (already as a patient) she received a suggestion that I should increase the dosage of drugs because my TSH is falling. She ignored my recommendation and consulted me with my endocrinologist who recommended to keep the current dose, unless TSH increases to 1, 2 - 1, 5 . In addition, he did not comment on the ""doubtful"" result of rubella antibodies, which he directed me himself . The fourth visit was quite OK. So she thought that the doctor was also a man, maybe he had a worse day last time. Unfortunately on the next visit (already the fifth) the doctor again suggests increasing the dose of thyroid hormone from 75 to 100 despite the lack of change in the TSH result. I say that my endocrinologist suggested changing the dose with TSH values above 1 and he said that you already have 0, 45. Shock and disbelief! Increasing the dose of thyroid hormone with the TSH results being at the lower end of the safe standard for pregnant women? I don't understand it. . . Or maybe it is Dr. Michalak who doesn't understand the feedback mechanism? The bitterness of the bitterness was sparked by an adventure with a weight in the office, which indicated a cosmic value - the doctor still entered the result into the card suggesting that it is not a big gain again. In life it did not weigh so much m ! 11 kg it was me who assumed the same weight during the whole first and second pregnancy, and now it is only 22 week and already 11 kg on the plus! I have weight at home and I weigh myself regularly, the more so that I am still physically active and exercise at the gym. Anyway, an increase of 8kg in just four weeks would suggest that something is probably wrong and would qualify me for some more detailed research. . . Right, Doctor?"
1297,"1 each of us, whether it was 1 time or 20, can say the same thing for sure: Exceptional, and has ""this something"" that can cause anger, the illusion that everyone is the same, but at the same time the ""charm"" and knowledge combined with great intelligence make you want to come back. I'm from Pomerania for visits drove me on average every month and I do not regret a single zloty spent in this city . I will say honestly that she could spend all day in this office, because there were laughter and tears, together with my husband returned to us encouraged. Now I am 37 weeks pregnant and I have my problems and a doctor on the spot but nobody has ever given me such professional and above all proven methods not only related to pregnancy but also concerning the whole organism and not many people know as much from outside their field as Dr. Markuszewski and I regret only one thing: she wanted me to be the one that the doctor saw our crumble first! So if someone doesn't like it, he knows where the door is : - )"

1299,"Equally important are the ecological sites, as the young generation is aware of the need to take care of our planet. If we want to bet on the growing generation of young customers, we must first of all change our way of thinking. The millennium generation is resistant to traditional forms of advertising, because it is based primarily on the opinions of its friends. If a given place is recommended, it will quickly gain popularity and proper reputation. It is necessary to adapt the website of our hotel for mobile devices. If young users using smartphones and tablets will not be satisfied with its appearance and usefulness, our chances of booking a room are quickly reduced. The recognition in the eyes of young people also builds uniqueness. If we care about Y-generation customers, we must focus on room innovations, traditional hotel bedding resting on an unusual bed, vegan meals instead of a pork chop or a range of technological innovations available at no extra cost."

At the beginning she seemed to be dangerous, but she was giving trivial cards and all 3 people in the group had the same birds and were sitting next to each other. Then she turned out to be very nice, but she started to exaggerate with the cards - she would blow us up, give us some questions not from the instructions, and even tasks. At the end, she made up a postcard from counting mistakes. She returned 50% of the reports, mostly for bullshit.

1306,"Science festivals are a good place to promote proper health and hearing care behaviors. Different types of hearing disorders affect every 6 children in primary school. Some of them are noise-induced hearing loss. Hearing is physics. Two parameters are crucial to our perception of sounds - pitch and loudness. The higher the volume, the higher the energy of the waves that reach our ears. If noise exceeds 130 dB, we no longer distinguish between sounds, but feel pain. Pitch is a consequence of how fast, i.e. how many times per second the object that is the source of the sound vibrates. The number of vibrations per second is called frequency and measured in hertz. Human hearing begins to register sounds of 16 Hz, below this limit we have introsounds that can be heard by e.g. elephants. We stop hearing sounds when they exceed 20 kHz, then there are already ultrasounds heard by dogs and used for echolocation by bats and dolphins."

He answered many of my questions with a smile.

Mr. Dr. Dr. med . Mr. Andrzej Sankowski advised me to wait with the operation and do it after the birth of the baby because then, possibly for one price, it will be possible to do plasticity not only of the scars but also of the abdomen after pregnancy. He also advised me what to do to take care of the scar, which would not cause any stretch marks. : ) I highly recommend it.

It turned out that after visiting another doctor and his good diagnosis my health returned to normal. After that, I could talk about the hormonal imbalance and do nothing about it. Many things he underestimated and at the same time tried to take care of the patient. Generally nice appearance but as a doctor he let me down a lot.

1315,"I'm putting up a neutral comment because I don't know what to think about the Doctor. I was with a child who has had a very high temperature and a cough for 2 days. The Doctor said that it is most likely a viral infection but to confirm it she recommended that I carry out tests, the results of which I had to send by e-mail. In case the tests indicated a bacterial infection, she wrote a prescription for an antibiotic. After sending the results I received feedback that the tests indicate a viral infection and we are not to introduce the antibiotic. The child, however, did not go through 4 days, while he or she had a fever of over 39 degrees. Luckily, we got to our trusted Doctor, who had no free time before and it turned out that the growth of neutrophils in the morphology indicates bacterial infection and the child has tracheitis and needs antibiotic treatment. If Dr. Jasterzebska confessed or checked the test results carefully, the child would feel better already on Tuesday. As a result, from Sunday to Wednesday afternoon the fever did not stop and after visiting our Doctor and administering antibiotic on Thursday morning the child got up without temperature."
1316,"During the visit, the doctor received 2 private calls without paying attention to the patient who was interrupted by this sentence. She focused more on the patient's parent than on the patient's own ailments. After a few sentences about the ailment, she already had her own opinion but ""about the mother"". My statements were repeatedly interrupted by telephone calls, her comments and examination (to make things quicker), so that she did not listen carefully and then evaluated my approach and questioned my credibility, as it turns out, by misinterpreting my words. The lack of a rational approach to the case she stated that either we immediately have to go to the hospital with the child or the child is fine and the symptoms she observed were a fantasy and lack of distance as a parent."

1321,"The hotel was built in Soviet times and not too long ago renovated. The hotel is situated in a noisy area close to the main streets and the windows although the hotel advertises them as soundproof, soundproof are not. The hotel is located close to the metro, which can be accessed to the city centre WITHOUT PROBLEM. Situated near the bazaar and park where young (and not only young) people gather. For this reason, especially in the evening, you have to go from / to the subway to go around. The hotel reception desk and lobby bar are large and made carefully. The restaurant is elegant, but because it is finished in white, it seems ""cold"" and not very cozy. The rooms are equipped with 3, 5 stars, but small because once, in my opinion, there were no bathrooms in them and during the renovation were made. The rooms have air conditioning, so called individual, that is, on the small balcony there are condensers with compressors, which work quite loudly. At high temperatures the air conditioning in room 1118 is not efficient. Buffet breakfasts are rich and tasty. Restaurant staff is careful and polite. From Boryspol Airport you have to enter the arrival terminal in front of the Sky Bus number 322 and go to the last stop located in front of the entrance to the main train station. Enter the station hall, go through the entire length of the station and exit the other side of the station hall. Continue left to the Vokzalna metro station, buy chips, go down to the platform and get to Darnitza station. From the Dnipro station the metro goes on the ground. You can see the hotel from the metro station platform. Travel time minimum 1 , 5 hours . By taxi of course easier but much more expensive."
1323,"In many cases, the low attractiveness is also determined by the construction costs which are too high in relation to the effect, non-ergonomic and low concern for economical exploitation parameters. Many such hotels have no chance of achieving profitability. Neither the current financial crisis nor the increase in competition on the accommodation market are conducive to achieving the desired prices. Offers of good facilities, those that not only earn money but also make a profit, are few and far between, and these are not usually announced publicly. It is also worth noting that recently there have been more and more offers on the market for plots of land intended for the construction of hotel facilities, or even with ready-made projects. This also indicates that some investors - less affluent or less professional, because they treat the hotel not as an object of activity, but an investment of surplus capital - think about building their own hotel."
1325,"I don't know what to think about it all, I went to Dr. Kądziołka when she was pregnant with her first child. In the beginning it was all right, Kacper was developing properly. When suddenly in the middle of the sixth month of pregnancy Dr. Kądziołki said that it was already almost halfway through the pregnancy so she should have to undergo a ""fetal anatomy"" examination. So she drove me to the hospital in Polna and as soon as the doctor started doing ultrasounds he told me that there was something wrong with the baby. It turned out that Kacper had hydrocephalus congenital. And after the birth it turned out that he had numerous changes in his brain through hydrocephalus, damaged respiratory, digestive and nervous systems. . . . . .and so she could exchange it. The child within 6 months went through five operations and died. . . Now I'm 5 weeks pregnant and I go to see Dr. Krzysztof Bartosz but I've read opinions about him and over 99% of his former patients are strongly advised against it. I have no idea where to go, I have worked very well with Dr. Kądziołka, he was always happy to answer my questions, he ordered tests but I have no idea why he didn't detect the abnormalities.

""For us, patient safety is paramount. Some of the procedures we teach our students are either very invasive or very risky. These are things that cannot be taught directly to patients, and such centres give the opportunity to simulate the real conditions that prevail in hospital emergency departments or intensive care rooms"" - said Dr Michał Nowakowski, head of the Department of Medical Didactics, responsible for the implementation of the development programme at the Jagiellonian University Medical College."

When inventing the name of the hostel, this tradition was skillfully referred to because the room could not withstand the stench coming out of the toilet. Probably the reason was a strange device connected to the toilet bowl which had my shit bravely after every flush. 24-hour airing didn't help. Moreover, I am adding to the bill a virtual 400 PLN in the form of stolen sunglasses, which he improperly left em in the bedding, and after which I reported to the client a few hours after check-out (while the suitcases were still stored in the hostel) .

As a doctor, the approach to the patient was fatal, dry, bored (we were at the NFZ). After the examination, he informed us that we could dress the child and make another appointment so we had to ask ourselves if the result of the examination is good. After the second examination we came out of the office equally dissatisfied with the approach of this doctor."

The cost was really big, because 150 PLN, but if it was for what, I wouldn't even regret it (which I don't do for a child). Basically he said that the baby is healthy, develops according to the age, but you can do a head start. When asked my question, for what purpose, is there any indication, he withdrew from this proposal and said that basically it does not have to be done: ? ? I don't know what to think. I'm sure she wouldn't have flew me this doctor to someone close to her. After the visit, I did not feel reassured even though everything was ok with the child, but on the contrary I am confused."

As Jorg stressed, the ""breast unit"" is not only diagnostics, surgery, chemo- and radiotherapy, but also further comprehensive care of patients. In the Katowice centre they will be able to count on rehabilitation, help from a psychologist or psychiatrist, and even the consultation of a plastic surgeon. In the centre, there will also be associations of Amazons and other organizations working for people suffering from breast cancer."
1333,"The visit cost 150 PLN. The doctor ordered to fill in a questionnaire, on which one should write his symptoms. I filled it out for 20 minutes, while the doctor told me what kind of famous people visit his office. When the doctor found out that I have been living in Warsaw for a short time, he started thinking about who is a real Varsovian and who is not. After completing the questionnaire, the doctor hid it in a drawer. Without an interview, he recommended testing in a friendly laboratory for about 900 PLN."
1334,"Only two or three years ago, the diagnosis of advanced melanoma, the most malignant skin cancer, was a death sentence. Nowadays, thanks to the introduction of new drugs, including immunotherapy, it is more and more often said that for many patients ""it will be a chronic disease"" - Wojtasiński points out. In his book he cites examples of many other cancers, in the treatment of which enormous progress has been made - chronic myeloid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer. He describes the experiences of many patients - including people known from the front pages of the newspapers - who have either been cured of the cancer or live with it as with another chronic disease. ""In the United States, there are already more than 14 million people who + survived + cancer,"" writes the author. 15% of them have lived for at least 20 years since the diagnosis. The journalist argues that the effects of cancer treatment are also improving in Poland, although it is still slower than in the West."
1336,"Professor is an outstanding doctor, a specialist of the highest level, faithfully committed to the Hippocratic oath, and above all, a person with a sincere desire to help and boundless empathy. After 12 years of struggling with various doctors, most often gynaecologists and endocrinologists, having had various diagnoses or most often a lack of them, having experienced the enormity of uncontrollable behaviours of my body after taking a lot of various unnecessary medications"". ...being hormonally unstable and on the verge of emotional exhaustion. As a result of all the unpleasant and often dramatic experiences she lost my faith in the abilities and skills of doctors. After the visit to my office the professor believed that there are people who really want to help me and give me hope for a normal life. She referred me to another, according to her, outstanding doctor who could help me, guaranteeing the possibility of treatment by her, if I wasn't satisfied with the new specialist. Usually, after a year of treatment, she lost faith in the competence of the new attending doctor; this time it is different - I am slowly gaining confidence in his skills. I owe the possibility of treatment with this specialist to the Professor. I would like to emphasize that Professor Izabella Kozłowicz-Gudzińska is the only specialist whom I trust without limits. Whenever I need it, she is there to give me advice and support, and she does it selflessly - out of a noble and pure desire to help. I have never doubted her competence and professionalism. Thanks to her, she has regained my strength and willingness to live and to continue healing."
1337,"Hello, I was going to see Dr. Crane, because she heard m that he is a good doctor and knows his stuff. After 1 or 5 years of walking, I'll just say that she hasn't found out anything specific to me why I can't get pregnant. Only the doctor is able to draw money, at every ultrasound appointment, he knows very well that too frequent ultrasound is harmful. Maybe he used to be a good specialist, now he does not get involved in patients' problems and devotes little time to the visit, does not explain what is going on and is notoriously late for visits after 1 or 5 hours. I don't recommend it - a waste of time and money."
1338,"Researchers from the Nencki Institute stress that these numbers cannot be automatically transferred to the human population. ""Although the mouse and the human being are genetically and physiologically very similar, they are nevertheless different organisms. Mice are only research models of human ailments and allow better understanding of disease processes"" - says Michał Mlącki . ""Today we cannot yet answer the question whether people with a damaged GRHL1 gene will develop non-uniform tumours five times more often, like mice, or whether it will be four or six times more. Research to determine the scale of this increase in human population has only just begun"" - points out Dr Wilanowski ."

1340,"The Marconi Restaurant is a reflection of Michał Tkaczyk's culinary passion - his excellent style, combining elements of Polish and Mediterranean cuisine, best represented by the famous duck with caramelized apples, seasoned with rosemary, garlic and cloves. The elegant Art Nouveau interiors of the restaurant, where the dark parquet floor contrasts with the soft white walls and delicate colour palette and unique details - crystal candlesticks and the best porcelain - provide a unique experience in a tasteful and romantic setting. The legendary Café Bristol is a place where tradition and the urban lifestyle are combined. Since 1901, it has been a place where guests are enchanted by its original Viennese style interiors, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, excellent dishes and sophisticated desserts. The Luxury Collection Concierge Golden and white lamps illuminating the unique, delicate eel skin in the reception area of the Rest Area create a tranquil, unearthly atmosphere from the moment you enter."
1341,"I was treated by this lady a few years ago, when she was still in the Estetica clinic. I don't recall it very well. Very long delays ( 1 - 1 . 5 h ) which I was only informed about in the waiting room. During her visit, the doctor was more interested in having a chat with an intern. It happened that she put on the wrong colour of rubber bands, which she asked me for. My teeth were not fully straightened after removing the braces. It was supposedly the fault of their ""barrel-shaped"" shape. I wanted an aesthetic result, but the doctor was rather dismissive of it. I do not think that the treatment was successful."
1342,"There was no fridge in the room, she came with 2 - every child so it is known that without a fridge or move. When she asked me a lady cleaning another room (where there was a fridge) why there is no fridge in my room, they said that all of them are broken, but not yet from all rooms they took out (although friends had and worked). The water was cold, it was going to ask me every day to turn it up and only worked as it threatened me that I will not pay what I had to pay, but only for a few hours, because in the morning it was already cold. very dirty, you can see that they vacuum only the ""paths"" in the room, because under the bed and nooks and crannies were covered with even some food leftovers, Wi - fi is but in the lobby, because in the rooms you can work as if it could not, the cable constantly interrupts, often does not answer,"
1343,"I strongly discourage Professor Radwan. He already has his years and a lot of things he forgets, me e.g. he prescribed hormones that I should not take and only the lady from the reception as I called me informed me about it and from professor I did not even hear the word sorry. Every time they told me to pay for something and as it turned out later on I had it included in the price and they returned (of course, as I warned myself). Contact with Professor ZEROWY! ! ! ! ! Of course, at the first visit he ensured that you can always call and ask. I never missed it, and the only time I called with a very important question, he said that the consultation over the phone does not give. The professor has so many patients that he never has time for anything and the visit to him takes 5 to 7 minutes. Because of this, the man does not even have time to ask important questions for him."
1344,"It was probably the weirdest hotel I've ever been in. Probably the old workers' hotel that was turned into a hotel. Interestingly, 2 of the 4 floors (if I remember correctly) are used as normal apartments. My room was pretty clean, but the furnishings are definitely old. The surroundings: supposedly it is better not to leave after 10 pm. Friends, hearing about where we live, asked if they could help us find another hotel. But to be honest, neither we nor our cars were hurt. The hotel was quiet, there were no disturbing noises. The food in the bar on the site, very moderate / not tasty. Two stars for the old furnishings / bar and surroundings. But don't be discouraged."
1345,"And I don't know anymore - the doctor is seemingly determined and well versed in things, but I'm annoyed by the chaos it creates, it's hard to get a precise answer to questions about e.g. prescribed drugs or prognosis. When I'm on a visit, I have the impression that I'm a little ""disturbed, because patients are waiting"". I guess I'll also go privately for some 1 consultation to get a second opinion about the diagnosis and treatment. But a great plus for the nurses in the treatment room - for the professionalism, order and friendliness of patients."
1347,"Nice guesthouse in a charming place and with a nice host plus Barcia ( dog ) . The rooms are cozy, clean, although the bathrooms are not the first of the youth, unfortunately, albeit neat. Warm climate dining room with a fireplace, where you can spend time in the evening with friends. Breakfast is tasty and varied. Close to the ski lifts, although without a car there is no easy access and I advise you to get chains in winter because the snow can surprise you and the house is on a hill. In summer, you can use the pool and grill in the garden. I like to spend my winter holidays there, but also in summer it is very charming."
1348,"I strongly recommend a visit to Mrs. Gabriela to anyone who wants to change their eating habits. She is a competent, professional and above all very kind person. I managed to lose 14 kg in 4 - 5 months, but most importantly, I did not have the feeling that I have to give up something and devote myself very much, because with time, new eating habits and a greater dose of sport gave me a lot of pleasure. Mrs. Gabriela is a great motivator and she devotes a lot of time to each patient. I recommend it without hesitation: )"
1349,"These are our comments, which we made in the complaint sent by e-mail, because we did not want to take it from us when we checked out. 1 . According to the offer in our room no. 22 there was no holiday set, e.g. 2 armchairs or sofas, no holiday part is not allowed in the hotel 5 * - this is also inconsistent with the hotel offer. 2 . We received a room with a very uncomfortable bed with a hole in the middle, which made it impossible to sleep and caused pain in the yards, a bed is a base in every hotel. There was hair under the sheet and it was not one, just a few. 3 . In the room there was a destroyed unsightly already unsightly floor with many duos in the panels, supposedly it was wood, anyway the holes were visible. 4 . In the wall there was a hole in the skirting board - a damaged slat. 5 . Dirty and unethical walls - something flooded, it was not visible immediately behind the curtain. 6 . Lack of possibility of full control of heating and air-conditioning - adhesive tape on the control flap - the first time he saw something like that, after arriving in the room it was very cold. 7 . Left connections in the bathroom from probably a washing machine - interesting view as if 5 * 8 . Dirty bathroom with mould and silicone defects and a loose glass pane at the bathtub as a shower cover. 9 . Lack of good lighting above the mirror - very dark . 10 . clogged drain from the bathtub, stone on the shower . 11 . Broken door lock housing in bathroom . 12 . Lack of possibility to enter from the street to the hotel in the hours after 21 . 13 . Unable to go directly to the brewery, you have to go from 600 meters to about 21 . 14 . Our room was above the brewery, it was supposed to be soundproof, and you could hear the guests from the brewery. 15 . On Facebook there was information that there was a board and an iron in the room, we did not have one. 16 . Breakfast as in 5 * without crazy and without eco and without real champagne as it happens in 5 * Our stay we consider as terrible, we were promised luxury in 5 stars and we felt like in a hostel. In addition, we could not complain on the spot and check out took 15 minutes due to problems with the supposed system. As proof we have photos from our room. I'll point out that we were there less than a 24-hour hotel from about 18 to the next day and we do not have the habit of checking everything in the hotel 5 * . However, the hopeless mattress inspired us to check everything and complaints. We received a brazen response from the director to our complaint. We were accused of destruction and did not respond to most points. There will be a complaint to the Consumer Ombudsman."
1350,"We were at the Zante Village Hotel in May 2015. The stay was very interesting - before the season was not crowded anywhere, but also most of the shops and taverns are still closed. The hotel itself pretty cool, clean - cleaned every day with the exchange of towels (if they lie on the floor). Bed linen probably changed 3 times a week. Room with an additional sofa bed and a large wardrobe - TV set included. Bathroom ok - to survive . Cool food - local dishes and euro . Drinks for meals two / three juices + delicious wine in three colors served on a table in jugs . Pool with bar All included in the price - clean but not too warm in May. Bar ok - pour as you like and how much you want . The area is quiet, within a walk the town of Alicanas (very climatic), the beach and in total. . . . everywhere close. Cool evenings - polar obligo (May) . Generally I recommend with a clear conscience."
1351,"I went to this doctor with all the papers / photos that I have in the last 10 years, with huge spine pains and with opinions from previous doctors who say that I have a good spine and this gentleman not only tried to listen to my explanations / problems with it, but he also questioned the papers that I came with! ! ! I even heard that for my colossal pains, my spine and poor mobility in the autumn-winter period I need only apap because I am too young (32 l.) for stronger pain medication! ! ! Besides, this doctor was not nice, arrogant and dry all the time, I do not recommend! ! !"
1352,"The doctor is a great specialist and a cool subtle man! Discreet, unobstructed, not overwhelmed, positive, concrete, and also gentle and courteous, and also caring and helpful. I was under his care the whole pregnancy and I could not imagine - until the first contact with this doctor - that gynecology / obstetrics can take such a friendly and human face while maintaining full professionalism and respect for the content. The visits to the doctor were such a fusion. As a result, she was happy to wait for every subsequent visit. I was convinced that the doctor has a wide and deep and very practical knowledge, and that he understands what a joy the new man is for me and that he enjoys this condition with me.) This was the case every time - the research was carried out very efficiently, gently and at the same time effectively, the interview was deep, but not too inquisitive or unnecessarily prolonged. Each of my questions was treated by the doctor with attention, giving a full answer to them, as a result of which she had no doubt that she found me a good professional - however, this taunting does not sound. I sincerely recommend this doctor to women who expect competence and partnership."
1353,"It is recommended that the daily salt intake should not exceed 5 g when it reaches 6-8 g, the risk of stomach cancer increases by 41%. and a daily salt intake of more than 8 g increases the risk of stomach cancer by 68%. ""A diet rich in fruit and vegetables has a reverse, anti-cancer effect. Consumption of 50 g of vegetables per day reduces the risk of stomach cancer by 19% . "" - noted prof . Yarosha . According to specialists, the frequency of eating fruit and vegetables is also important. When we reach for them one to three times a day, the risk of cancer is reduced by 14%. Eating them three to five times a day makes it drop by 29% . And five to seven times, it decreases by 36% ."
1354,The lecture leads you to understand how you're gonna pass it all.
1355,"I'll start with the fact that I'm 17 years old and in April of this year I was diagnosed with ""something"" (I call it that because nobody was able to tell what exactly it was) in the right hemisphere of the brain. The only thing that was certain was an immediate operation. It is also worth mentioning that on Monday she had an MRI and on Friday a surgery. On Thursday she was transported from her city to Cracow for surgery in St. Raphael's hospital. The operation was successful without any complications. After the examination it turned out that it is a nonmalignant neoplasm Glejak grade 1. Despite that I do not have any radiotherapy or chemotherapy. More than two months have passed since the surgery. I feel good, I'm slowly getting back to myself. I would like to thank Dr. Czepko with all my heart for his professionalism and approach to the patient. I am very grateful to him for his care of me. I will recommend him to everyone because he is a trustworthy person and is in the right place ~ a grateful patient from Nowy Sącz ; )"
1356,"Mr. Arcadius usually lets everyone through without much trouble. Unfortunately, he has problems with going to classes. I don't mind - I have the same problem ; ), but he could have a little less of a problem with the students ; ) Examinations usually do not belong to the easiest ones, but he still lets them pass."
1358,"For several years I have been struggling with terrible acne on my back, she used various means to get rid of the problem, visits to the previous dermatologist did not bring any results. . On the contrary, it was getting worse and worse. . she was ashamed to show up at the beach or pool without a T-shirt, basically she lost hope of ever getting rid of it. The acne was pretty strong and painful! It wasn't until the Doctor gave me a suitable antibiotic, which finally brought the expected results. I am very pleased. Besides, the Doctor is very nice and accurate, she talks and advises. And I finally got rid of my problem : - )"
1359,"I came to him on the recommendation of my family doctor to consult if there is a chance to rehabilitate my vertebral hernia or if I have only surgery left. He said that ""I won't be able to get out of the grounds, but I should absolutely try it because people don't come out of such things"" and then that ""for the time being the surgery won't get away from me"". He drew my attention to his great respect and not to criticize his colleagues. When he answers the question whether he knows or has heard about someone, he does not want to evaluate their diagnosis or proceedings (e.g. recommended exercises) and does not get into discussions about others. When he says something about someone, he compliments them on their actions. I have to say that this surprised me very much because I am used to the fact that in medicine, each successive criticism of the previous one. I was before the visit to the family doctor about a few specialists and wanted to know something about their actions so far, whether they were justified, unfortunately, with Mr. Olkowski there is no such conversation. He answers that these are their ""autonomous decisions"" and ""he is not entitled to comment and evaluate the actions of other specialists"" . She got me in the meantime to visit a neurosurgeon, she told me about the rehabilitation that after a week the pain almost disappeared and he confirmed the good course of action with Mr. Olkowski adding that this rehabilitant always makes very reasonable decisions and sends him back patients to rehabilitation of the spine. After almost two weeks I am very happy because it goes for good and I can only praise and recommend to others this physiotherapist ."

1361,"Unfortunately, it doesn't work. Diet and exercise are the only valuable method of weight loss . Without STRESSED Diet pills have no effect at all. When dieting, they do not even increase the metabolism. Unfortunately, weight loss is a long and self-denialing process. Taking these pills with a good strict diet I have the impression that I lose weight twice as slowly as without these pills. It's a pity, because after these opinions I expected something really effective to help me lose weight. I think it's a complete loss of money."
1362,"Whooping cough, formerly known as pertussis, is an acute, infectious airway disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. In the first weeks the symptoms of pertussis are not different from other upper respiratory tract infections. Then typical repetitive and prolonged coughing attacks appear, especially at night, often leading to severe exhaustion. A cough of varying intensity can last for many weeks. In older people it can even lead to rib fractures. ""The most typical, classic symptoms of whooping cough are found in unresistant infants and young children, and less typical, mild, in adults vaccinated against whooping cough in childhood"" - said prof. Leszek Szenborn from Wrocław Medical University. He added that in more than 5% of the cases. The patients under 10 years of age who are hospitalized have serious neurological symptoms - seizures, paresis and even deafness and blindness."
1363,"I'm very disappointed in this place. Always in Ciechocinek we choose a proven guesthouse, unfortunately this time we were forced to change the place. In Villa Victoria, at the beginning ""greeted"" us, probably the owner who asked for an advance payment. After the booking and delivery of the rest of the amount for accommodation (you asked for a fee for the stay in advance) decided to inform us about additional fees for the stay. Of course, you have to add the air-conditioning fee to your room, which you have not mentioned before. The lady had nothing to say when she asked me why she is informing us about the fee only now. Then she showed us the room and at the end we were informed about the additional parking fee, which is obvious. After another dose of ""surprises"" we decided that we did not want to stay here even a minute longer and asked for a refund. The lady said she wouldn't give us back our advance payment, which we had paid 15 minutes earlier because, quoted here: ""she has already booked"" and she didn't care that we have to inform about the additional costs before we can collect the advance payment. Such an arrogant and rude person has not met us for a long time. Now we have understood why only this guesthouse is full of vacancies. We strongly advise against staying in this place."
1364,"Mathematical analysis I , lecture Algebra linear, lecture Mathematical analysis II , lecture [ / b ] One of the most interesting lecturers I had to deal with on polybud. Classes conducted with humour, clear and factual - However, it is better to pass everything in colloquia, because there are various tasks on the exam and there is no chance for Dr Dudek to put a positive one if it happens that he misses 0, 1 point - he has his own rules and dot [ center ]."
1365,"For the time being, it's not so easy to show that an infected patient who comes to the doctor with a fever and a cough has the flu. Relative certainty can only be provided by tests of samples taken from the patient, which are not available to ordinary bread-eaters (mass tests or PCR). These tests are not only expensive, but also take a lot of time - you have to wait a few days for the results. Doctors, unable to immediately determine whether they are dealing with a viral or bacterial infection, sometimes - just in case - prescribe antibiotics to the patient. And this in the case of the presence of a virus, e.g. flu or rhinovirus, is completely unnecessary and contributes to the weakening of the body and the formation of strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics."
1366,"Generally ok, the staff was nice, the rooms were cleaned every day, unfortunately during our stay the balcony was not even once swept, so it was full of dust and sand. The air-conditioning almost didn't work at all. Medium breakfasts, for someone who likes eggs, bacon and beans every day will be ok. For us, too monotonous and unsavoury."
1367,"hello ! she decided to write her own opinion about your doctor because she has never been to a PEDIATRY doctor who has absolutely no approach to children ! My child is 3 years old and has never been afraid of any pediatrician, has never cried at any visit - until the visit to Mrs. Kozierowska. I regret that I decided to visit her because now my child is afraid to even show his throat, which was never the case before. In addition, she heard many unpleasant words about my upbringing. The doctor immediately said that she should see a psychologist with her child because she will notice the beginnings of ADHD in him. My child was so upset by the visit that she couldn't calm him down from crying for the next hour - I'll add that she saw me in such a state for the 1st time IN LIFE! ! ! ! Both my parents are doctors with long practice and Mrs. Kozierowska could learn from them respect to the patient, approach to the child and man and modesty. The doctor ordered to undress the child, who was given goose bumps - during the examination she stated that she had never seen such atopic skin in her life and she accepted this statement despite our shy remarks that the child is cold! ! Our daughter approached our daughter with great reserve and severity from the very entrance to the office, although the child was calm and a little bit scared - which does not surprise me at all! ! ! ! The saddest fact is that the medicines that the doctor prescribed do not work at all! ! ! We are now facing further costs associated with travel to another doctor because we are from a small town, another cost of the visit, another cost of medicines and all this is a child's injury to doctors probably for a long time! ! ! ! I do not recommend to anyone Ms. Kozierowska."
1368,"I am after a nose surgery at Dr. Obrocki's in Medicover, actually the doctor at first nice and then when you are informed about the problems it gets rude. I am already after visits to various laryngologists, I have adhesions in my nose and it is advisable to have a laryngological procedure to improve the patency of my nose, I clog one hole and at night I breathe only through my mouth. I do not recommend your doctor. In other forums I have also read negative opinions about your doctor, so I am not the only one giving a negative opinion. Girls, think before you operate on Dr. Obrocki."
1369,"As early as in the 18th century, astronomer Jean Jacques d \'Ortous de Mairan, studying the plant - mimosa - found that its leaves open towards the sun during the day and close at dusk. He decided to check what would happen to the plant permanently in the dark. As it turned out, even without access to sunlight, the leaves opened and closed in a constant daily rhythm, as if they were controlled by an internal clock. With time, more ""clocks"" of the plants were discovered - Charles Linnaeus created in Uppsala the first ""flower clock"" with flowers opening at certain times (its accuracy was several minutes). Biological clocks, which help to adjust physiology to the time of day, were also observed in animals and humans. This regular adaptation is referred to as a circadian rhythm."
1370,"The hotel is very clean. Bathroom shared, but there was no problem because it was often cleaned. Breakfast is good, but a little monotonous. Great service, which you can always count on in any situation. The area is a bit noisy, but a great base for exploring the historical centre of Istanbul."
1371,"This doctor treated me for infertility without any further diagnosis, according to him Polycystic ovary syndrome (found after the first ultrasound). He gave me some medicine from under the table, he gave me medicines, which are given after surgeries to dissolve adhesions and he gave me medicine for diabetes. Finally, she decided that I would go to someone else because an internist grabbed my head when she told me what medications I was taking. She went m to another doctor. This one for six months examined me under every account. Eventually it came out that I have an elevated prolactin and when she got my medication, after 2 weeks she was m pregnant. Of course the polycystic ovaries never had m. He also showed you by twisting your arms how you have twisted your ovaries through the backbone? And because of that you can't get pregnant? I'll add that I have two children. I have a slight bend. Everyone will do what they want, I'm just warning."
1372,"- It is not possible to scroll forwards / backwards with the remote control. - It is not possible to set the radio stations in the desired order . - The buttons on the unit itself make a fairly annoying sound (deafening plastic void) when pressed. - Turning the unit off with the slide control on / off at the rear will cause the volume level to return to the default 18 ( quite loud ) when turned on later. Interestingly, when you press the On/Off button on the remote control (upper left corner) to switch off, the volume level is the same as it was before switching off (which saves the situation and what was not as a ""lifebelt"" for AEG MMR 4128) . Unfortunately, there is no way to find anything better than a two-way speaker in this price category on the market. I also recommend that you do not try the AEG MMR 4128, which I mentioned above."
1373,"1 . Room : Very small and tight . If someone is claustrophobic, I advise against standard rooms. There is no place to put a cot for a child - you had to take a chair and a bedside table out of the room to fit the cot. Very dirty carpet in the room. Uncomfortable mattresses. No double beds. 2 . Children's playroom: very many cool toys, TV. VERY dirty carpet . 3 . Restaurant: delicious, fresh food . Very nice and smiling staff . 4 . New Year's Eve ball : SUPER ORGANIZATION ! Good food, beautifully decorated tables. Nice DJ . It was really good fun. Location: close to the slope but with a view of the parking lots from all sides. You leave the guesthouse and feel like in the center of Warsaw when it comes to the number of cars on the streets. I don't know how it looks like in the off-season, but at a time when everyone comes to ski, it's hard to find the closeness to nature there. Price: I think that the price in high season is exorbitant for the conditions (at least) in double rooms. I do not say anything about the conditions in larger rooms."
1374,"We should also remember to inform the guest each time that the presented conditions (price, date, number of people, range of services) apply to his or her specific, single inquiry. We also reserve the right to change any part of the order which may result in a change of prices. In conclusion, I assure you that even if we present only one proposal to our guests, they will not run away from us. All the more so with two or three. We know our own product best and should be able to pass on its advantages to consumers. All it takes is one properly prepared offer. If a guest is not satisfied with it, it will certainly be a good starting point for further discussions."
1375,"A wonderful doctor. When it comes to the approach to the patient - incredibly nice, attentive, attentive listens, scrupulously asks about the symptoms, disease history. I have already been with this Doctor 3 times and each time she had an explanation of the examination she was doing, she warned about possible pain (which was not there:)). ...with a calm and friendly voice. I did not feel any embarrassment, but I am rather a shy person. As far as medical knowledge is concerned, she immediately made a good diagnosis. The previous doctors did not manage to deal with me very well: ( . Every time she orders the necessary tests without any pressure, she explains exactly how to take medicines. I recommend it with a clean heart. The atmosphere in the Clinic is really great, I recommend"
1376,"Hostel located on the outskirts of Prague . 800 m from Kačerov metro station . Access to the center approx . 10 min . Very cheap accommodation . The lady at the reception speaks Polish . And all the advantages. Unfortunately, sanitary conditions do not meet any standards. The whole facility requires a thorough renovation. I do not recommend definitely, especially to families with children."
1377,"A large campsite, located right on the banks of Lake Garda, great swimming pools for large and small, the only downside - if you want to have a good locality you have to be in line before opening the campsite. We were at the beginning of July and the weather did not spoil us once hot and on the second day there was a storm and no sun. Italy more expensive than Spain quite much . A great amusement park Garda land right next door"
1378,We booked two rooms from the holiday package at the end of October (many times confirmed by phone). The hotel staff was unable to send an e-mail with the reservation confirmation and payment details for a month. After the phone call 23 . 11 the lady again said that the reservation is up to date and will immediately send an email. the payment deadline is the end of November. After our e-mail with the request to send the data to be paid on 24 . 11 we receive an email back that our reservation has been cancelled. You can not talk to anyone competent. This hotel is a misunderstanding. The guest is treated as an intruder. I don't recommend
1379,"The rooms are very neat, clean and pretty. Nice service . Well located - close to the city center. Beautiful views from the rooms . The only thing that bothers you is the noise coming from behind the windows. In general, the hotel I judge positive, good first impression. Surely I was not disappointed when I arrived. I recommend to visit this hotel during your stay in Prague."
1380,"The hotel new clean spacious large rooms with huge beds and so many positives. Very small choice in the food and everything spiced with ginger so that whatever you eat it tastes the same, the beach and go down to it looks endless, 2 pools but by the large pool bar only paid, no animation hotel for people 60 + everywhere far away you need to rent a car and to see something. I recommend the city of Nessebyr beautiful worth seeing. The hotel should have 3 stars max ."
1381,"We spent a very nice week in the hotel in January. It was a holiday period so there were a lot of guests, but it did not affect the quality of the stay in any way. The rooms are very pleasant, each equipped with an electric kettle, fridge and hair dryer (this was crucial for us because of the small child). In the hotel, after prior reservation, you can rent a cot with bedding, a baby bath and a heater. In the corridors there is enough space to leave a pram or sledge. Two lifts facilitate communication between the floors with a small child. The dining room is equipped with feeding chairs and special ""pads"" for older children, there is also a small playroom. The second children's playroom is also located on the ground floor next to the restaurant - children have a lot of fun to choose from. Meals (breakfast and dinner) are served in the form of a Swedish buffet so there is sure to be something for everyone. In the changing room at the pool there is a changing table for the little ones. The pool has a paddling pool with a slide. There are also two saunas and a normal sports pool. SPA offers a wide range of services. The beach is at your fingertips. The service is very nice and helpful. We are very pleased and highly recommended."
1382,"Dearly beloved, I went with my girlfriend to the Resident Hotel for May. According to the opinion, the hotel should be in the top of the list of facilities in the Tri-City . However, the opposite happened completely. After arrival, we got a room where there was no shelf for cosmetics even in the bathroom. He would have swallowed it but it is hard to understand why the pillows are so uncomfortable. The next day he wanted me to go to the gym, but unfortunately, there was a renovation and nobody was able to inform the guests. I typically went to the gym for entertainment, but it was not given to me for the whole stay. Another friends also had a problem with the pillows (very uncomfortable), another problems also appeared with the gym because no one informed them about the renovation work. As compensation, my friends got a Welcome drink which I got em without asking for compensation . When he asked em for a refund, he got 'em breakfast for the price . Generally the hotel should never get 5 * . I'll add that the damaged furniture doesn't help maintain status and no parking at the hotel ."
1383,"A set of stereo speakers looks very good, as for the purchase price of 175 PLN both sound and performance are OK. On the plus side there are two pairs of RCA inputs. However, the declared power of 2x10W seems to be sufficient only for smaller rooms, and with louder listening, the speaker capabilities are quickly exhausted. Generally, a very successful product, even the bass from such small speakers is sufficient - a little plump, but there is enough of it (there is still a knob on the back for additional bass adjustment). I recommend it."

Now it turned out - the crochet came out! The procedure detected by Moderation explains the situation. Dr. Smolinski Ryszard not only helps in the office, like he helped me. Dr. Smolinski Ryszard ( Wrocław ) helped thousands of people through his many years of writing activity. I recommend an outstanding doctor and psychotherapist."
1389,"First, we had mixed feelings suggested by an empty office without medical devices. After a few minutes it turned out that the doctor was an expert in his field. He even has a sense of humor. He explained the course of treatment to us. We felt understood. The medicine that the doctor wrote down is unfortunately in cosmic price and there is no substitute."

1391,"We visited the inn in 10 people to have dinner in a traditional tavern, we should have already retreated as the waitress stood in the very entrance and smoked a cigarette, then she told us to watch the children because she was washing the windows and so we wouldn't get her dirty, the dumplings only serve until 17: At 00, the lady wasn't very nice and they check in for a sachet of ketchup, the food was ok, when the tourists came from Germany everything was different, the other Polish people came in and left quickly, because we didn't do that, the Polish people avoid this place."
1392,"I got to Dr. Czapiński 10 years ago. I am grateful for his help. I have been suffering from migraine for a long time and it was only during my first visit that I found out that it can be treated somehow! I have suffered a lot before, I live in Rzeszow and no neurologist (and there were many of them) could help me. When she told them about her symptoms, some of them could even laugh at me! They prescribed me some strange, ineffective medicines. . ( now that I hear in the ad that the apap for migraine is laughing at me heh . . ) I do not wish anyone to get sick of it! When at her own wedding she even got a migraine just before going to church, she told me enough! After a few weeks she found me in Czapiński and finally started to treat me and live a normal life ! Migraines were less frequent. . She could have already relieved the terrible pain by medication ! Now I am a young mother ! I don't have migraines yet! Let's hope she's calmed down! Sometimes it doesn't. . And to get back to the topic . . I know that visits to Dr. Czapiński are expensive and you still have to buy medicines, but I do not regret that she took advantage of me and to this day I am grateful for his help."

1395,"We can take care of the endothelium ourselves, especially by paying attention to what appears on our plate. ""It is important to remember that the diet should be balanced, rich in vegetables and fruits, which are a source of vitamins and antioxidants, and limit the consumption of animal fats"" - explains Dr Balcerczyk. ""Secondly, lose yourself to eliminate stress, which is not always easy and take a lot of exercise. All this will ensure an adequate endothelial activity profile and minimize the risk of cardiovascular diseases,"" he adds. Modern endothelial studies are carried out on many levels and concern various aspects of endothelial function. More effective treatment of endothelial diseases is possible thanks to a better understanding of its role in the development of particular diseases."

He explained everything exactly. The right man in the right place. Worth recommending.
1397,"The hotel is some kind of massacre. Running rats in the dining room, old and in the middle of nowhere. Cooks should learn how to cook, nothing was seasoned and the food was only on two tables (and this in the all inclusive option). The air conditioning is stinking and buzzing. To sum up, the ITAKA travel agency guaranteed their tourists a holiday that they will remember for a long time. The last time she went m with fraudsters who can only praise such a ruin ."

Before the procedure of removal of my varicose veins he explained everything thoroughly, she could without hesitation ask me about everything without saying that I can always call and I am sure she will answer the phone. The care in the clinic both during and after the treatment is wonderful, of course from the side of the nurses and the doctor. Of course I am very pleased with the fact that she decided to have a treatment in the clinic because she spared me the time associated with convalescence and probably the scars that she would have if I had reported to the National Health Fund. I recommend you to those who have a problem with varicose veins AestheticMed clinic and Dr. Tomasz Hamer. Gosia"

He can't say ""Good morning."" ""Goodbye."" he had no idea where to take the bus, and all he had to do was check it on the computer. - In the shower, a mushroom! ! very unpleasant smell, same as in the toilet. Generally speaking, ""DIRECT"". The smell was all over the room, at night in winter you had to open the windows because you couldn't sleep. - Bed linen dirty - No soap in dispensers - No shampoo - No wardrobe for clothes, we had to spread out on the hotel table to the cleanest does not belong to the cleanest, so I will never return to it again."
1401,"Wonderful hotel , Wonderful service , Wonderful food . The hotel exceeded our expectations. Beautiful and well-kept rooms, very clean, cleaned 6 times a week. Beautiful sea view from the balcony. Comfortable beds, great decoration. The best food she has eaten, every day for dinner different cuisine: Italian, Asian, Greek, international, Mexican. The choice is incredibly huge, so are the breakfasts and lunches by the pool. A lot of sun loungers by the pool itself, most often occupied by others since 8 am, but it didn't bother to find a place a bit further away. All inclusive at the highest level. Service at the reception and restaurant manager great! We are happy that we found ourselves in this hotel. Rocky beach, but it's not a problem. Lodges about 10 euros for two with an umbrella. TUI did a great job, the resident was also very nice. Rent a car at the hotel, all legal and without hooks, 30 euros per day, for a car economy. attractions for children and adults in the evening and during the day. I swear, it couldn't have been better and I recommend to everyone!"
1402,"Worst hotel 'em were in. In the rooms mushroom on the walls, the wallpapers are moving away from the walls, the whole hotel smells of rotting. The shit, the cold. . . . .not recommended. Meals are a mistake. Don't believe in the pictures on the Internet because they're only taken for show. The price is not in line with the hotel standard. Never again."

1404,"She was organizing her last-minute stay at the Daisy Hotel and I'm not hiding the fact that I was happy that she found me a place to stay at all. Booking a double room for a fast, she didn't have much of a standard, but I was glad that there is a pool, billiards and a sauna. The gentlemen who received me at the reception, on the day of my arrival, were nice and seemed to be professional, eager to establish various details such as how to get to the center. On the day of arrival, she received two double vouchers for breakfast (because she had two nights). I admit that it made me happy and it worked soothing especially when she saw my small, modestly furnished room with a mini TV, disgustingly dirty floor covering. The bathroom was roughly cleaned, but there were cobwebs on the walls, the rug lying on the floor was dirty and the blankets lying on the beds smelled of dirt and were certainly not washed for a long time. The bathroom probably had a bad smell coming out of the sewage system, which soon filled the whole room. There was a window in my room, which was the size of a barrel! On the second day of my stay at the Hotel, it turned out that the vouchers for breakfast were given to me by mistake and I should pay for them (each 25 PLN). Because of the fact that I had two more vouchers left, she gave them to me at the reception, recognizing it as an act of good will on my part, because it was the staff who made a mistake, I had no knowledge that the price of accommodation did not include breakfast. The gentleman who talked to me about it explained in a very calm way that there was a mistake and in no way suggested to me to make a payment, but the manager of Hotel Daisy in my opinion behaved very badly. The lady directly appealed to my integrity, she suggested to me twice that I should pay for what she ate and in effect she used the statement that she would have to pay for me. Since she came to Krakow to rest, I didn't want to make a big fuss about it, but the disgust that is left over from the visit is there and I certainly will never go back there again. I think that there was a lack of culture, class and sense on the part of Mrs. Manager, who wanted to pass her mistake on to me. I wonder if she could have deliberately taken advantage of the breakfasts on the second day as well, and consider it a mistake of the staff: ) To sum up: dirty, bad smells from the sewage system, breakfast nothing special (certainly not worth 25 PLN), claustrophobic rooms and a repulsive manager! ! ! The white crocodile (probably) bedding deserves praise, but nothing more. The hotel is dominated by a specific smell of chlorine, because the pool is located near the reception. I do not want to know what is the purity of that place. . . .I didn't have the courage to enter the pool after what she saw me in my room!"
1406,"As the researcher explained, Randy's research. Schekman's research concerned the search for genes that regulate transport in cells. James E. Rothman examined the protein machinery and mechanisms that allow the bubbles to reach the right place in the cell and connect to the right part of it. Thomas C . Suedhof was interested in how transport looks in nerve cells. ""For him the most important were the neurotransmitters. He showed a breakthrough: for a fusion of synaptic bubbles to take place, the calcium ions must be strictly controlled by the appropriate proteins,"" added Professor Suedhof. The product . As PAP's interlocutor explained, the mechanism for regulating the so-called bubble transport is very precise and is often compared to the principle of a zipper - everything must be perfectly matched."
1407,"In short - professional, concrete answers about what, how, why, what for and what to do next, physical examination done accurately, procedure/treatment commissioned, center and doctor's approach pleasant (he would say that Dr. Judge is a doctor ""of the young generation"" - a professional who by working with a patient together achieves something. And yet this facebook ;) ) . I do not even have anything to stick to for balance . And the patient's version: The doctor asked 'em for a prolonged pain in the shoulder joint - he wanted 'em to have an orthopaedic doctor perform various upper limb manoeuvres to determine whether or not the joint itself has been damaged, and what to do about it. I had a few more minor questions about other orthopaedic matters. At the beginning of the visit the interview and then the physical examination - the doctor bent my limb in all possible ways and it was immediately known that the joint itself was not injured, only the muscle was stretched. And in these 5 or 10 minutes the main purpose of the visit was already done - as it should be. Another issue was cor stabilitis (which I did not expect). I will not go into the great descriptions anymore - in short, the doctor conjured up a problem of which I was unconscious and was not the ""subject"" of the visit, made further physical examinations and the diagnosis was clear. I was told where the problem came from, what to do to correct the posture defects - here both treatments and the use of special shoe insoles were ordered, I found out what kind of shoes to wear, it was very unpleasant for me to recommend physical exercise ;) - I mean, in general, I got me the information I need. For me, a hit and a novelty in the Polish health service was to order me to watch a set of warm-ups before the effort on the center's Facebook page - normally the way you look at the world. : ) At the end he asked 'em 3 questions about some minor symptoms there and got 'em answers - short and concrete . Finally, there were also watch cases . The visit took place on time. Judging by the available appointments for one patient is 20 minutes - I sat 'em for at least 30 minutes, even closer to 40 minutes. That's how much time was needed for me and I found myself, there was no hurry. The resort itself at Energetyczna Street - nice, neat, neat, colourful. The office is probably air-conditioned. I RECOMMEND IT. As part of the inspection or in case of other orthopaedic problems I will return to Dr. Judge, because the visit met all my expectations (and even more, it was supposed to be a simple diagnosis of shoulder pain, came out completely different matter and was settled right away)."
1408,"Big disappointment . The rooms are heavily woven, not to say ugly, destroyed. It's not the level I'm used to on the Accor network. The wellness area still remembers the 1980s. Nothing but waiting for the tiles to fall off by themselves. What is most striking, however, is the fact that the Novotel priority, i.e. the family atmosphere, is lost somewhere. The service is sad, overwhelmed, not willing to help. Ordering scrambled eggs at breakfast is a real crossroads. I felt bad for me in this place. I definitely do not recommend this hotel. I have the impression that many hostels would be more pleasant."
1409,"The doctor is quite reserved and perhaps not very cordial but I owe him my life. She came to the hospital in 6 weeks of her pregnancy and a stomach ache and blotting. Mrs. Larsa, in the emergency room, ignored what I said and told her to go to her doctor but literally asked for an ultrasound and then immediately called Dr. Jakubiak. He continued to do the ultrasound himself and immediately referred me to the surgery. He was leading the operation himself. Everything happened quickly and I feel good. The oviduct was pregnant. The wounds are healing quickly. The next day, at the check, he quietly checked everything and answered every question. He aroused my trust."
1410,"A full time. I have booked a family room 4 + 1 extra bed for a child of 42m2 . On the spot we were accommodated in a room 2 + 2 extra beds without the possibility of putting a bed for 6 years! The room was smelly sewer and cigarettes, where supposedly the room was non-smoking. There were no towels or disposable cosmetics. For the second day at the reception desk, they had things taken to the reception desk before 12. At 00 and around 14. At 00 you could move into this room, which I was bouquetting and actually paid upstairs! We had a day of sightseeing in the back because we were sitting and waiting for our room, it was a scandal! Another issue - on booking.com there was a description of the hotel's services - reception, lobby, swimming pools, Jacuzzi, saunas, but nobody mentioned that you have to pay 200 crowns to enter the pool! ! ! plus for the sauna and towels, the property belongs to another owner and is across the street and the passage is underground, so to get there you have to go underground, billiard rooms, the bistros where there are lots of people and smoking. . . . Such information should be included in the description of the hotel and not mislead people! ! I'm disappointed with the staff and what happened to me there. Never again."
1411,"I had Maya 12 kW right BS in the old version ( without this faceplate ) . In my opinion, the design is not bad for this price, but the gap between the panes is at least 3 cm. After 1 winter and daily smoking, a crack appeared on the back wall. In this fireplace was not very dirty glass, the hurdle was cast iron, at the front there were holes blowing clean air on the glass, the fireplace in addition to the crack was tight - you could choke the flame by closing the intake and the glass. After reporting a complaint Gratings brought me a new Maya for replacement - as in the picture. The fireplace is leaking - even after closing the glass and the intake - the fire is buzzing in the fireplace (a little weaker than in the open). In the new model, the cast-iron hurdle has been replaced by a sheet metal cover. The air supply to the windshield has stopped working (no air vents). After 2 seasons, the cover is already burnt through - I wonder if there is a guarantee for it, because it is not a grate or a window? I will check . The only factor that cleans the windshield is the air sucked in through the gap between the windows - it cleans the windshield a bit. A few days ago he discovered to 'em that there is a crack in the side window. He frightened em that the manufacturer probably did not foresee the possibility of replacing the windows - the windows are riveted with metal sheets! The heat in the fireplace stays very short. Wood, despite the fact that seasoned 2 years (hornbeam) can not burn. I do not recommend this insert. Its advantage is its appearance and price. Disadvantages mentioned above ."
1412,"Unfortunately, I have to give a negative opinion on your ""doctor"". The doctor diagnosed my son (a premature baby of 31 weeks old) with a third-degree intraventricular hemorrhage, which in such a condition is associated with a disability in addition to a cyst in the brain. We were broken down with our husband, but fortunately we found another neurologist more competent, who ruled out the doctor's diagnosis and ordered a new headgear and here a miracle occurred after the strokes and the cysts also miraculously disappeared. The son develops properly without a trace of handicap . In addition, we also received a recommendation to rehabilitate the vojt, where in such a stroke it is forbidden because it can make the child worse. But he is a doctor and a specialist . The doctor is very unpleasant treating the child as another object of research, objectively zero empathy."
1414,"Maybe a surgeon and a good surgeon, though I was just 'em on a consultation that wasn't without its perplexities. The plate that delivered 'em from the hospital, the Doctor could not read and therefore did not make a diagnosis. Despite everything, I had to pay 150 PLN for the visit. In order not to waste this money, he invested another 140 PLN in fuel and drove em to get his laptop home (to prove that it was not my fault, the record could not be read). On my computer, the Doctor finally made a diagnosis. To sum up: when going to the Doctor you must have a full wallet, a full tank of fuel and a laptop. A friendly lawyer would also be useful."
1415,"She had the privilege of being forced to spend time in this center. Our group rented a cottage that did not meet even the lowest standards. A room for 4 people and two beds and one ""bunk"" in the offer for adults is a mockery. In addition, the bed was so old and so complex that any movement on it caused wobbling to the right and left and squeaking (OSH is probably an unknown abbreviation for the owners of this resort). There was no possibility to hang a shower anywhere in the bathroom because the handle was broken. The next thing is the traces of a mushroom coming out in the corners of the walls. Unfortunately, the stains were so huge that they could not be overlooked. We bought our meals in the 'restaurant' too early. which turned out to be an ordinary table and the lowest flights. The most important thing is that the ship is not a luxury, but at least a level for people and not for animals. The canteen offered us the option for vegetarians, which I took advantage of. I was surprised when on the day of my arrival for dinner I was served what I had been served on a regular diet with the only difference that instead of chicken I got a strange, boiled 'mixture' of peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. On the second day I was given a fish while the waitress and cook were very surprised that vegetarians do not eat fish. On the 3rd day she got me a strange 'medallions'. When asked what it was made of, she heard a 'surprise' from the cook. I understand it was supposed to be nice and funny but the day before that the same women gave me the fish and they were very surprised that fish is also meat so how could I trust her and the meal was so ground that she could not recognize its ingredients for anything. Regardless of the price, the conditions should meet the lowest standards. Unfortunately, this place does not meet this standard. Moulds coming out on the walls in the cottages, the lack of a shower holder (not only in our house), squeaking, wobbling beds. Food for vegetarians with cardboard values - none."
1416,"The doctor is crazy about the Oder! ! ! As a pediatrician for sick children, yes, I recommend it, but ABSOLUT NOT! When it comes to vaccinations, everything is postponed indefinitely, and does not pay attention to the fact that the disease for the little one is more dangerous than NOP. More common sense, we don't live in an empty space, we have to vaccinate and not wait and pray that the little one does not catch anything."
1417,"I also went m to Mrs. Tkaczyk by accident - she had free terms, and I urgently needed a consultation because I could not get to my specialist . It's a pity that at that point I didn't light up the ""red light"". It is difficult to talk about the time she devotes to her patients because during my visit she talked to a friend on the phone about dietary supplements, and in addition, she cursed and did not apologize for anything. She looked at my previous results without interest, laughed at the previous endocrinologist and made a diagnosis - see opinions above - Hashimoto, ""you will read to yourself on the Internet"" . She recommended a diet without lactose, without gluten, without green vegetables - without a word of explanation, in addition to vitamin d supplementation, which I can not take . She herself had to decide what tests I had to do, as if an MRI of two organs would cost 5 zlotys. I have a comparison with other specialists ""with vocation"" and I strongly advise against visiting Mrs. Tkaczyk ."
1418,"She has used the Doctor's dental aid many times during this year. The Doctor explains and explains everything calmly, clearly and at the same time she is very friendly and cheerful. I would like to point out that my dentition was in a very bad condition due to negligence and fears on my part. Moreover, I am pregnant with my teeth to be removed and root canal treatment, which did not discourage the Doctor. She chose the right anesthesia and constantly controlled how I feel. During the internship she was not afraid to consult senior doctors or dental surgeons, which in my opinion is an invaluable advantage. Knowing what effect on pregnancy has on the state of the future mother's dentition, the doctor was interested in and analyzed my basic research results. We were in constant contact and she answered every question I asked, even those repeated several times. She performed the dental procedures herself slowly, carefully and focused. Afterwards, she informed me every time the tooth was in a condition and which methods / means she used. In addition, as a future mother, she was instructed how to take care of her son's teeth and of course her own. Without even the slightest doubt, I recommend visiting Dr. Magdalena Rytel . She is a rare doctor in my opinion - performing her profession fully professionally and with passion."
1419,"How much are the ratings written a few days after starting to use ? Nothing. I'm evaluating more than two years after the purchase . During that time, the washing machine was doing great. Simplicity of use, modest display without fireworks, quiet operation, overall it was ok. Until. . . The warranty ended in January, now the bearing has fallen. Probably according to the manufacturer's intentions. The cost of replacement (of course, inside everything is integrated, half of the tripe is blown out) 720 PLN + labor. Decided to use the equipment without repairing it until it completely fell. I'm hoping to make it to summer. This will give a total of 2 or 5 years of use with an average monthly cost of 30 zł. Is it much or little? Let everyone answer for themselves. I was expecting the washing machine to work a little longer, although I had no illusions that it would be 20 years. But 5 could be, and it's not. In conclusion, good, cheap, handy equipment, but to be scrapped after the first failure."
1420,"I've recently been a patient of this doctor in ""Copernicus. "" I can't comment on his knowledge because I don't have a medical education, but the approach to the patient is definitely better than that of other doctors in this facility. Besides, he always reads every document carefully and, if it is necessary, he arranges the terms radio - or chemotherapy himself. I have confidence in him."
1421,"Last time we were at the Colosseum with a boy, we decided to share our opinion. The guesthouse itself is ok . Very neat, clean, well-kept rooms. We have no objections in this respect. Rooms with bathrooms. The object itself is located in a ""hole"" . You have to get to Prague first by bus (to Opatów) and then by subway (from Opatów directly to Prague). This did not bother us at all, because the guesthouse itself was really ok for a romantic trip. The food for breakfast was delicious - fresh, real juices - not from cardboard. The climate of the restaurant, as a wonderful decoration, climatic. The only things that spoiled our trip and stay at the Coloseum in Pruhonice are the exceptional nahalism and insolence of the restaurant staff. We suspect that it is the regulation of the owner-manager of the restaurant to ""bankrupt"" and in a very insistent way TAKING people to order something to eat, come and buy dinner or other benefits. I understand that everyone wants to earn money, especially in a small town, but everything has its limits, which have not once been crossed. I was personally reluctant to even come to the breakfasts we paid for in advance to avoid this intrusive behavior and min when we declare that we will not order dinner. It was already rude. If it weren't for that, our romantic stay would have been sincerely successful. Personally I look at it all differently - because I work in tourism myself, I am a tourist guide. She left me to rest and spend a romantic weekend and met with a huge surprise, which despite numerous professional travels she had not met before. Both of me and my man were outraged when the staff (or maybe the boss) came up with another scam seeing that we will not order anything more from the offer than what we had in the previously purchased benefits. Namely, at breakfast we were given a card with scrambled eggs and sausages - of course ALL ADDITIONALLY PAID. Shock . In other hotels, even those with two, three or even five stars, she has never once encountered such a thing. I warn you, because the customer policy should change quickly. The customer must not feel forced to do anything. As an object - just accommodation (rooms) we recommend."
1424,"Going to visit Mrs. Alice my problems stood still and she felt worse and worse. The meetings were expensive in relation to the quality of the conversation, and Mrs. Alicia seemed to be emotionally cut off and looked at her watch. She was also informed that my problems were ""inside me"" without explaining what it was about. If I may suggest something, I do not advise you to visit your psychologist for serious matters."
1425,"Dr. Karachun diagnosed our son with Osgood's disease - Schlatter in his left knee. After 2 months of rehabilitation (2 - 3 times a week in a private office under the supervision of Dr. Karaczun) the knee stopped hurting and the doctor stated that the treatment is complete and the son can exercise. On the second day, the child returned from w - f lesson with the same knee pain as at the beginning of the disease. Dr. Karachun couldn't explain why the disease came back (supposedly he never had such a case) and recommended ... further rehabilitation. After another month of exercise there was no improvement and we decided to seek help elsewhere. During the first visit to a new physiotherapist we were informed that the child has a large contracture in the right knee and therefore the O-S disease in the left knee came back (because the right knee still bent weakens the left one). In fact, it was visible (it was enough to make the child stand up straight). We found out that without a cure of the right knee there is no chance to recover the left one. The new rehabilitation (once a week), which focused mainly on stretching the right knee and generally the whole body, removed the injury very quickly. We made an ""oral complaint"" to Dr. Karachun asking for reimbursement of the costs of the failed treatment. They told us about the course of the new rehabilitation and the reason why the disease came back. He did not agree with this opinion. He stated that the contraction of one knee has absolutely no effect on the condition of the other. They asked us to write this statement on a piece of paper - unfortunately he refused. They suggested that he should stand on a slightly bent knee in order to feel that the other knee is being put on (you don't have to be a doctor to say that). He also refused. Dr. Karachun only removed the effect of our son's left knee disease, so she came back. However, he did not remove the cause of this disease (right spasm) and therefore did not make a proper diagnosis. When we asked him why he didn't even look at the second (right) knee during the first visit, he answered that the patient didn't say anything, that he was in pain ... . Unfortunately, but the contraction does not hurt! Dr. Karachun, on the other hand, accused us that : 1) we treated our knee too shortly, 2) our son wanted to come back to the exercises so much that he lied (!!!!) after 2 meters of rehabilitation, that his knee no longer hurts, 3) once (before we started the treatment) they put a warm compress on our knee, which prolonged the treatment! We lost 3 months and about 3 thousand zlotys (4 private visits + 2 - 3 rehabilitation per week). We do not recommend visits to Dr. Karaczun at all."
1426,"The opening of the third B & B Hotels chain in Poland, in Wroclaw, is planned for the end of summer. ""We hope that the hotel will open no later than September 1st this year. ” says Beatrice Bouchet, President of B & B Hotels Poland. A model room has already been built in the building, the hotel will soon be plastered and the installation of stone on the facade. In June the furnishing of rooms will start. B&B Wroclaw will offer a total of 140 rooms with air conditioning, free wireless Internet access and satellite TV. There will also be 40 parking spaces available to guests, almost half of which will be in the underground garage. On the ground floor of the building there will be a conference room. The hotel in Wroclaw will be the first B & B facility in Poland to offer such facilities."
1427,"The doctor was approached by a 3 week old daughter, who was born with a cursed foot. Every doctor who examined my child was attentive to this (from the neonatologist in the hospital, to the neurologist and the pediatrician in the clinic). and not just the doctor, because the difference between one foot and the other can be seen immediately. Only the doctor did not see a problem that theoretically specializes in this. After the examination, which took literally a few seconds, he found that, as for him, both feet are identical. IN CONCLUSION: I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR! ! !"
1428,"The fourth series of antibiotics in our 8 m - black daughter caused intestinal dysbiosis (which manifested itself as a fungal infection, eczema, significant reduction of immunity). More doctors, more antibiotics. . . In order to get out of this vicious, antibiotic circle we found ourselves in the doctor's office. And finally we met a doctor of the XXI century. . . .who is holistic about the patient. . . The doctor took a lot of time to explain exactly where to start treatment and how to rebuild what was ruined. We have a long road ahead of us - a change of diet, long term use of high quality test tubes. We are very pleased with the visit. I highly recommend! ! !"
1429,"Researchers from the Adam Mickiewicz University of Medical Sciences. Piastów Śląskich in Wrocław and the Department of Anthropology of the Polish Academy of Sciences ( Wrocław ) examined the severity of andropauzal symptoms in 232 men with NS systolic heart disease aged 40 - 80 and 362 healthy men of the same age. To assess the severity of andropauzal symptoms, the researchers used the Aging Males Symptoms Scale (AMS). In the 40-59 age group, andropauzal syndrome was much more common in men with heart failure compared to healthy men (28% and 7% respectively). In the 60 - 80 age group, on the other hand, andropauzal syndrome was equally common in men with NS and healthy men. As Wrocław researchers note, chronic heart disease probably accelerates the natural process of a man's aging, thus causing earlier occurrence of andropause symptoms."
1430,"Scientists have long known that the human brain adapts after injury or loss of vision. ""The visual cortex of blind people loses its original function, but it does not remain inactive as it switches to, for example, touch reading and linguistic memory,"" says Dr. Szwed. Until now it has only been assumed that such reprogramming is also possible for people with disabilities, but there is no concrete evidence for this. Only simple studies have been carried out on the plasticity of the tactile cortex, during which the subjects practiced distinguishing between velvet and velour or corduroy. ""For the first time ever, we are able to show that the brain of a healthy adult can be reorganised on such an enormous scale,"" he stresses. According to Dr . The Swede can also reorganize other parts of the brain in a similar way, not only the visual and tactile cortex. ""One of the scientists showed his study a recording of the piano keys pressed, but without sound. The visual cortex, or the motor cortex, was activated by people watching the film who were not playing the piano, because they imagined what it would be like to move their fingers. Meanwhile, in the case of professional pianists, the auditory cortex was also active, even though they did not hear anything"" - described Dr Szwed in an interview with PAP."
1432,"I don't recommend it if you have a complicated pregnancy. She is incompetent, she undermines the authority of other doctors, if she disagrees with something, she hovers and shouts. After visiting another gynaecologist, she heard a completely different diagnosis, approached my problem quietly, recommended more frequent examinations during pregnancy. After the visit to the Doctor she came out stressed and shaken, and probably a professional gynecologist should not leave the patient in such a state. During the visit she went out for 10 minutes to bring something and came back smelling of cigarettes. The whole visit was quick and there was a huge delay. I do not recommend this doctor to women who require the doctor to be professional, calm and calm about the problems that arise during pregnancy. Maybe if the pregnancy is proceeding properly this woman behaves completely different. . ."
1433,"The first drugstores were ready already in 2011. Piotr Merks prepared them himself at home. In 2013 for the first small grant he conducted a pilot study in Radzymin near Warsaw . ""He put on em nearly 9,000 of such drugstores. The effect was fantastic, because it proved that thanks to them patients make much fewer mistakes while taking medicines"" - he explains . Finally, the project attracted the interest of the Gdańsk capital fund Black Pearls VC. On the basis of the idea, he created the company Piktorex, for which he obtained PLN 1 million from the BRIdge Alfa programme run by the National Centre for Research and Development. Piotr Merks became the project manager and in six months' time he wants to present the result of his work to the Ministry of Health."
1434,"Staying in this hotel is always a success. Spacious rooms, very nice service both at the reception and during meals always tasty and in sufficient choice. There is plenty of room for children to play and you can actually feel that the child is an important guest for the hotel. A place close to the center as well as the sea, but there is no hustle and bustle that prevails in the very center. We often stay here at different times of year and everything is always ok. The price is adequate to the services provided. The building is already old but it is very spacious and even at full occupancy it does not feel tight."
1435,"I had 'em analyze 1 with Mr. M . A terrible boredom in the lecture (mainly rewriting the script), unable to translate at all, doing the tasks on the board with errors (you still don't manage to rewrite because you cover everything with your posture, as it will reveal). He loves to make evidence of the statements, but he only does those that are at the end of the script. But there are advantages. Banal wheels (just rework the script and you have 4), tasks on wheels taken directly from the script (changed data). Generally for ambitious people it's not worth it, and for those who want to go to 3.0 - it's worth signing up, there's no point in going to lectures, a little bit of your own work and it will be fine : - )"
1436,"She was doing an ultrasound of our baby's tummy in Medicover hospital. Nice, although with some reserve, the result showed the ""gassing"" of the tummy on which we breathed because after a clear drop in the amount of milk eaten by the toddler, strongly bloated tummy, screaming, pouring food, bending the body and other symptoms that may indicate something worse we were very concerned. The doctor said that the pediatrician is not the paediatrician and referred him to the doctor. . . . .there wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that when we ran to the pediatrician on duty (Medicover Hospital, Magdalena Dylewska) she didn't have time to examine the toddler, claiming that she had to make appointments for patients in much worse condition. . ."
1438,"Among the consequences of untreated thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women, the gynaecologist mentioned heart failure and maternal hypertension, miscarriage, premature birth and higher perinatal mortality of newborns. Hyperthyroidism as much as nine times increases the risk of low body weight in a newborn, which is associated with a higher risk of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, in the future. Untreated hypothyroidism threatens to delay the child's intrauterine development - when hypothyroidism is evident, it affects every fifth child. ""Children of women who are untreated due to hypothyroidism in pregnancy are more likely to show delayed intellectual development, have greater problems with learning, speech, reading, motor development. They are four times more likely to have a low intelligence quotient, i.e. below 85"" - mentioned the specialist."
1440,"In early July we visited the Charlotte Valley. They planned a visit to the zoo and then they wanted to have a tasty dinner at the restaurant (they remembered the good cuisine when they visited the place a few years ago). Unfortunately, the visit was not satisfactory to say the least. After entering and finding the table, we waited 10 minutes for anyone to come and give us the card. In vain. There were four tables occupied in the restaurant, but the waiter did not advise us to visit. He asked me for the card himself. After a while, the waiter caught up with us and said he'd serve us right away. Promises of tricks. It took another 10 minutes. When placing the order they asked us if it was possible to cook a small amount of pasta for our daughter (one year), especially since there were probably four types of paste in the menu. The Lord stated that ""they do not play with such things"" (literal quote). OK, not that. Normally they would have left the restaurant after such an answer, but we were hungry and the nearest restaurant was far away. After the order was placed, we waited 25 minutes to serve the soup. So we got our first course about 45 minutes after we arrived. The second dish came at a more reasonable time. As long as I could forgive the waiting time, the waiter's rudeness is not a gift. I sincerely advise against it. You can eat better and more pleasant in many places in Pomerania. There is also a curiosity - in the meantime a very famous sports commentator has entered the restaurant. He received the food earlier than we . Bravo"
1441,"She treated four teeth, three of which were small, but with a tongue that could be felt. I don't know if it's a lack of precision / professionalism or rush. The doctor makes a tooth that has holes on both sides and only heals one. Is there something I don't understand, or is it normal that I have to pay for one tooth twice? The visits are not the cheapest ones either; no matter if the hole was almost to the root or just a small cavity, the doctor counted 180pln each time. During the visit, which confirmed my conviction that it is time to change the specialist, the doctor treated me very gently. The tooth catch was partially snapped on the upper lip, on which the wound appeared, and after the visit also a lot of swelling. Personally I will not go to the doctor. I don't know about you, but I don't like to be treated like a money-making object, which can be handled gently and imprecisely."

There is no contact with the owner, who will be on Monday. Super that there is a ""monkey grove"" and playgrounds for children, just a pity that my child is going hungry."
1443,"Hello, Doctor, nice person. As a patient, I miss the description of what the doctor sees. Because if he doesn't describe the condition on his skin, he either doesn't know or... . . .well, what else? . Luckily, the medications that the doctor prescribed turned out to be more obedient. However, it was the allergologist who indicated to me the exact skin condition. . . . . .maybe and rightly so. . ."
1444,"I fully agree with the review "" Wyspianski Hotel has class "" of Mr. Wieslaw G . For me, the most important thing was the location - close to the railway station and just by the Market Square - during a few hours of wandering around Krakow, I could regenerate in a very comfortable room and explore further. She did not feel the lack of parking because she came by train. Shampoo . . . could have been, although the ladies rather use the right hair for their own hair, so she didn't notice that it's not there. I can't comment on the other rooms because she was there for the first time, in my one, everything is OK. It is also very important to have a nice service, very good breakfasts (if I had to find any disadvantages, maybe a small selection of dark bread, but I did not come to taste the bread :) and at every step you can see the attention to the comfort and well-being of guests. I will definitely live there again someday."
1445,"I didn't like it. Small, tight rooms, bathroom practically in the room, for breakfast even scrambled eggs were not there (bread with fast and jam for 20 zł ...), waited until 12, noisy. 100 zloty more + 15 zloty uber and could have slept like a lord in a hampton by the hilton, unfortunately, he saved 'em."
1446,"The Euro 2012 tournament is history. There will be time for a tourist and hotel summary. The sports and hotel summary is short: the European champion for the next four years is the Spanish team, which had its accommodation base in the Mistral Sport Hotel in Gniewino. The runner-up is the Italian footballers who stayed at the Turówka Hotel in Wieliczka during the tournament. The prospects of organizing another football tournament of this or higher rank (more and more decision-makers have an appetite for the Mundial in 2022, perhaps the idea of organizing Winter Olympics together with the Slovaks will come to life) are foggy in Poland and are more in the sphere of wishes than realities. However, there are two other events ""revolving"" around the ball. Men's Volleyball World Cup - 2014 A four-year volleyball tournament is played every four years, which at the turn of November and December 2014 will take place in 6 Polish cities."
1447,"Holidays purchased in the Last MInute offer, I do not hide, because of a bit of compulsion due to holiday dates. Before departure, we have read the opinions of other holiday makers and I am sorry to say that many of the negative opinions were reflected during our stay. I will start from the beginning. Food . The first 4 days are a tragedy. Very small election, meals prepared from the rest of the earlier dishes. Don't be surprised by the spaghetti of kielbasa or the mixture of peas and corn. The dishes are very hard to digest, mostly with a large amount of oil. Cakes, weird, wet, poured oil. Drinks to choose from, served by the waiter - I had a strange impression that they were mixed with water. In case of ordering directly from the waiter - without reservation. Days 5 - 6 - 7 the food has improved. In general, there was a strange atmosphere during the food, both the chef and the bartender were watching the holidaymakers while putting on and eating. We felt a little confused. Hotel. From the outside it was very nice. Air conditioning paid, for 7 days - 42 euros. The Internet is supposed to be, and there is no Internet. Both in the morning and in the evening practically does not work. The slogan has changed with 16 times. For the password we go directly to the owner, who writes it to our phone or laptop. I am not able to determine the quality of the link between 9 am and 7 pm because we were not in the resort. Due to the poor sewage system, the toilet paper is not drained but thrown into the garbage. What is more, we had a terrible problem with ants in our room. The furnishings of the room's interior are very good. Modest and tasteful. The owner is very kind and helpful. The stay itself I rate well . A little attention to the purchase of tours . The bus does not drive and does not drive directly to the center . Most of the bus journeys end at the bus stop, there are 200 - 300 meters to go on foot."

""We already have all the documents necessary to implement this project. The total cost of the renovation is estimated at 65 million euros. About one third of the costs will be covered by the new investor, Takami Holding, and the remaining two thirds will be obtained from external sources. We expect the hotel to open its doors again in the first half of 2015. Joseph Hannah, Managing Director of the European Hotel, said two years ago. The building is being modernized according to the general assumptions of one of the earlier concepts - the building permit was issued in mid-2011. - The building permit was issued in mid-2011 and was prepared by the Sud Architectes studio.

1450,"I am rewriting, because in conclusion from other entries, a lot does not change with your doctor. In a private office, a nice, promising - and in a hospital, he avoids and ignores patients. My mother was treated by a doctor. Trusting the doctor, we believed in his opinion that mom is able to work and can freely enjoy life (with embolized aneurysm). It is not the family that is a specialist - they believed in the doctor! ! ! My dear Mom died half a year later, and we were living this time in the ignorance of the real danger in a false conviction - coming out of the CABINET with the opinion of a specialist - the leading doctor. Was it I was supposed to know what kind of behaviour and lifestyle should actually lead my dear mother and that she should be under constant, strict control, if the doctor did not recommend it."

1454,"""Trichloroethylene can reach our organisms while eating, bathing or even inhaling,"" says Dr. Anna Śrębowata (IPC PAS). As she adds, in small quantities this compound causes stomach pains and vomiting. However, if its concentration in water exceeds the norm for a long time, liver, heart and brain damage can occur, as well as the development of cancer, especially leukaemia, lymphoma and bladder cancer. ""The methods of fast and cheap removal of trichloroethylene from the water are therefore of great social importance,"" he says. Speaking of research details, doctoral student Isabella I . Kamińska (IPC PAS) explains that organic chlorine compounds can be removed from water using a reaction known as hydrochlorination. ""It uses small amounts of hydrogen and an appropriately selected catalyst, usually palladium. The reaction occurs where organic chlorine compounds in the water are transformed into non-toxic substances - saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. In the case of the reaction with trichloroethylene, these are ethane and ethylene,"" he says ."

Sometimes Dr. Frost will give a trivial question, sometimes he will throw a question that nobody would get it together.

From the hotel you could walk to both Disney parks. We could also take a walk in the surrounding park and by an artificial lake. We stayed in the family room in one of the Sequoia Lodge Hotel buildings. The room was big enough for the four of us, clean - cleaned daily, and the children were delighted with the Mickey Mouse head-shaped soaps; ) For breakfast we went to the main building a few tens of meters away from ""our"" building and I must say it was a pleasant morning walk among the greenery. Breakfast was rather varied - everyone could choose something for themselves. The children liked the French croissants. The biggest attraction, however, was the visit of Disney characters, with whom you could take a picture, and for an extra charge you could have breakfast with them, but we did not use this option. We also did not use the swimming pool, although there was such a possibility. The service was very helpful and kind. We communicated without any problems in English, as our French leaves a lot to be desired, while people from all over Europe work there, so you can communicate without any problems in other languages too. We have often heard Spanish, German and Italian. To sum up - a very good hotel for a family with small children - despite its size, it maintains peace and quiet for its guests. I recommend it!"

The swimming pool is not accessible for the handicapped, the car park is a total flap, the seats are still occupied.

On the one hand, a very cool, quite a promising building from the outside, which you look at and think - probably inside I will find a loft, industrial, minimalist climate and equipment. On the other hand you enter and mega disappointment - inn reception, corridors, all colours, solutions and decorations adopted from the wedding rooms. In short, disappointment. In addition, in the middle of the bowling alley and the club, so in the evening, there are plenty of young people sniffing around under the windows at night. In the rooms some random ideas for the device.

It's basically a conference pavilion with several rooms. It's a conference pavilion with a few rooms. It's furnished without any taste, with furniture like they sell from a car on small town markets. The dominant colouring is beige and brown, the smell of cigarettes, no cosmetics in the bathroom (except liquid soap on the sink). The air conditioner on the wall is but the remote control is missing. The only plus is a very good quality window woodwork.

The beds are so uncomfortable, with the frame between the springs falling to the side. The air conditioning system worked at its maximum because the knob was missing. . . So you could only turn it on and off. We feel cheated because not only did we have to have a swimming pool on the roof of the building but it was still nice. . . .

Then an express nasal examination and prescription of the steroid dome (previously used ineffectively) and ensuring that with such a condition you have to learn to live with. At the end of the announcement of another visit, pay 150 PLN and you can go home (in my case 400km) . A waste of time and nerves is an advice for those going to the professor . Today I am a few days before the surgery, because I found a doctor who does not claim that ""with such a disease you have to learn to live"" and advised to operate as soon as possible! !"
1464,"My impressions from the first visit to your doctor. The doctor interviewed me in great detail about my ailment. He analyzed the results of the research (the whole history over 5 years) and explained in detail the interpretation of these results, he also presented various possibilities of the cause of the disease. He set the course of treatment (including the possibility of modifying the medication depending on how I feel while taking it) and indicated the diet that should be used in case of my condition. He also indicated additional examinations which I should perform and regular examinations before my next visit. Over the past 5 years, I have been visited by many haematologists and all of them have acted very templates for my condition, and my condition has not improved as templates as it should. The doctor, on the other hand, considered her various causes not so obvious that other doctors did not pay attention to at all. As for the visit itself, the doctor listened to me very carefully and did not rush at all, explained in detail and made sure that everything he said was well understood, felt very well taken care of. After the first visit I think that the doctor is worth recommending."
1465,"Was 'em with the family in January 4 people room in order big clean comfortable . Swimming pools generally okay Not always was the same water temperature . The reception desk was not quite well organized nobody could tell when there will be free seats in the garage . The weakest point is the wave restaurant where one lady with a cloth in her hand tries to keep the whole two dining room waiters with small trays try to pick up all the plates, often missing tea or lemon or other small things. Of course, the staff reacts to customer requests, but that's not the point of asking for another thing every 5 minutes. The choice of dishes is moderate, many different additions as for squirrels surely cool because a lot of nuts I prefer concrete. Good cakes . In the cafe prices moderate . The air conditioning in the cafeteria all the clothes smell of burnt oil . Generally at 5 * a little weak. If there will be a super offer i.e. much cheaper than the competition you can use but if you're looking for real 5 * it's not here yet. I hope this opinion will help you mainly hotel and one day you will be able to come back because there is potential ."
1466,"I went to see him - additional ultrasounds when I was pregnant, he was also the first gynaecologist to whom I went, expecting to be pregnant. She was satisfied with me, although maybe sometimes she wanted more information and kindness. She met him unexpectedly in the operating room, where he was conducting the C-section. Seeing a familiar face in a room full of strangers in a rather unpleasant situation (sudden diagnosis to be solved immediately) - the caesarean did beautifully, I have almost no trace of the cut. The child is healthy (and even snout). I was surprised and saddened by the fact that she refuses hormonal contraception. . ."
1467,"When she went to Mimosa she read my opinions and knew what to expect. But what she saw me on the spot was a disaster, she used to be in different hotels and houses for rent and nowhere was that terrible. The old hotel, we had a room on the 9th floor, an elevator, a small room in drawers and cabinets and under the bed is full of dust. Bathroom drama, there was not even light by the mirror, terribly dark. The kitchenette was a little bit disintegrating, the three of us were laughing and the plates, cutlery and mugs were for two people, so we didn't use it even once. The view from the terrace to the ocean - so beautifully, but the terrace was scratched. It's all you can experience but the breakfasts were a nightmare, terribly poor two kinds of horrible minced meat, yellow cheese, eggs planted with some beans in red sauce and bacon, sometimes sausages, and all week long the same. . . The pool is cool, deep, sunbeds for sunbathing at a higher level old rip-off. In general, this hotel deserves barely 2 stars. I don't recommend it."
1468,"Up to three times art , someone finally managed to comprehensively take care of my damaged knee ! The doctor is very accessible and friendly to the patient and has obtained professional and full advice on my injury from him. After having been treated at the Pilczyce Hospital, she felt more at home than at the ward - all because of the fantastic staff and Dr. Kniazia himself. Thank you that I can finally get on my bike after so many years of lack of any physical activity! I strongly recommend both the staff and the services they provide. : )"

1470,"At the Friday's press conference summarizing the cross-border project ""Telemedicine in the Euroregion of Pomerania - Pomerania Network"" the Rector of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin prof. Przemysław Nowacki said that the cooperation in the creation of telemedicine network concerns two German regions: Mecklenburg - Vorpommern and Brandenburg and Polish West Pomerania. As Nowacki explained, ""the project involves the transport of data, which will be used primarily in the diagnosis of selected areas. According to the principle: let the data travel, not the patients "" . ""This region, both on the Polish and German sides, is poor in people. Large agglomerations, which have a dense medical network, hardly exist here. Therefore, it will be extremely important to be able to transport data electronically, on the basis of which specialists in selected places could read them and make reliable diagnoses,"" he explained."

1472,"She was with her boyfriend on a week-long vacation in Zakynthos , Hotel Captain's . They had a room with a view of the sea. We were positively surprised that the above mentioned hotel has its FREE sun loungers by the sea, and free WI-F: The great advantage was also that we could use two neighboring hotels, the Commodore and the Admiral, where something was happening all the time (zumba in the water, Greek evening, discos and animations for children). The service was nice and always smiling. The food was very good, there was breakfast, lunch, snack - bar, lunch - dinner - dinner also at which we did not come down from the beach and we always found ourselves with a meal. The minus was the lack of food and alcohol in the beach bar: (You don't go to anything else. We had 2 rooms, a TV, we were cleaned daily, we were given clean towels. As for me, both the Argassi village and the Captain's Hotel have a hand on the heart worth recommending! ! ! ! : )"
1473,"Location: in the suburbs, in a poor and densely built-up area of Durres. (approx. 10 km from the centre, 25 minutes by city bus) . Room: small, with a poor standard bathroom and a view of the adjacent residential building - due to the hotel's location among densely built-up areas, all have such a view. Dining: served, poor quality, monotonous (the same breakfast, lunch - mainly grilled dishes every day) Amenities: dance hall, gymPlusy: wide sandy beach 150m from the hotelPrice: I'm not a very demanding holidaymaker and I didn't expect to know what luxuries in the price that we paid, but the hotel is much below the expectations of an average - demanding client."
1474,"It's okay, but they don't wash up to Duplo. I was very disappointed with the material they are made of, it looks like it is made of cheap Chinese toys. The colors are also not as intense and cheerful as in the case of Lego. It was quite a challenge to make a swing for me. My daughter would never have managed to do that. They do not fit as perfectly as Duplo and it is much more difficult to separate them from each other. The pads themselves do not leave much room for imagination and creativity - you fold them as in the pattern and already . The figure of the piglet is cool - realistic and mainly this element convinces me to this set . I'm glad she didn't invest me in a big house because I originally thought about it. I do not want to say that these blocks are hopeless, although it certainly follows from my statement, I think however, that people who have tried Duplo will be disappointed with this set"

The hotel is nice, the location is also fine, the rooms are nice, properly equipped (even board and iron). The swimming pool for such a big hotel - too small.

1476,"I agree with the opinions of my predecessors. The hotel is perfect for a holiday with children and more, but most hotel guests are families with children. The hotel is a great hotel, the rooms are nice. The ones with a sea view have a balcony with a beautiful panoramic view: ) The food is varied, there is plenty to choose from. In addition 3 a la carte restaurants: Italian, American and Greek. also worth a visit. swimming poolside places a lot, lots of attractions. In the beginning of June, the water in the hot pools. if someone likes to relax and explore the surrounding area, they wouldn't want to leave the hotel for 14 days. 8 days stay in 100% too little considering that in Cyprus is what to see. Beautiful mountains with the monastery of Kykkos, and the surrounding area, a wonderful zoo near Paphos with a parrot and owl show: ) The interesting capital of Nicosia, the beach of Aphrodite etc. is really worth it! The hotel service is great, and who wonders who should take advantage: )"
1477,"This hotel offers very good value for money. The location is good: there is a lift in the hotel which stops at the back exit of the hotel near the central part of Torremolinos. The beach can be reached in a few minutes from the front entrance of the hotel. The swimming pool is nice and I have not had any problems with renting a sunbed, although I admit that I was not there during the peak holiday season. I can't say a word about the restaurant because we didn't eat there once. They preferred to go to nearby restaurants instead, which are very different and much cheaper than 15 euros from the person that we would have to spend in the hotel restaurant (not counting drinks). It was a bit noisy here because of the large group of Scandinavians staying here, but they moved out after a few days and the hotel was quiet again. Our rooms were very clean and we didn't have any problems with cockroaches or insects, about which I read in other reviews. If you are looking for something cheap, in a positive atmosphere, this hotel is for you, but if you expect 5-star quality for little money, you will be very disappointed."
1478,"He spent 2 nights at the hotel with his family. We stayed in a suite superior room, which consists of a living room and a bedroom connected by a sliding door. The suite is very well equipped. There is a tea and coffee set, a richly stocked minibar (prices are not excessive), a shoe cleaner, a small safe, two telephone sets, bathrobes and slippers. The room is fresh and modern. The bathroom has a wide range of cosmetics and cosmetic accessories and weight. Very good breakfasts. Nice service at the reception and restaurant. The hotel has a very good location, only 20 minutes walk from the heart of the Old Town. At the hotel there is a spacious guarded car park at a reasonable price. This is a very good middle class city hotel. I will be happy to return there."
1479,"Overrated . (similarly to other goods (e.g. bosch screwdriver from the series for prof . use !) As for this price, he expected a higher quality from the robot. Only after a few times of use, the lubricant starts to come out from under the shaft / stirrer socket. This should NEVER be the case at this price. In general, the robot has the power, and it looks like it's not going to drive - although I'm worried about the gearbox if it's going to spill - it's going awfully loud. The kids in the kitchen are running away. . Besides, terribly expensive extras, whatever it is. Personally, now we wouldn't buy it."
1480,"My husband and I are under the charm of this place. The location is ideal - if you don't want to go to the sea (it will be with 3km of forest) you can lie on a deckchair on the bank of Vistula. The rooms are clean, decorated with taste. Bathroom large and clean . Our room had an exit directly to the garden which is ideal when you come with a dog. Breakfasts and dinners are abundant and tasty. Ladies with service very nice and helpful. The only downside is the thin walls - I do not like to listen to what the neighbor does in the bathroom. And the prices, but that's how it is in season by the sea. We'll definitely come back here."
1481,". . .I spent a week at the hotel. . . .leaving Neckermann Poland. The room with a view of the sea. The stay started with problems: no internet, broken kettle, broken wine opener. The problems were immediately solved (the same day) and the rest of the stay was flawless. The hotel complex has a great location, cleanliness, beautiful architecture and excellent cuisine. The staff is very courteous and client-oriented (especially applaud the Nectarias serving tables on the terrace). The hotel guests have the opportunity to take advantage of sports activities, cooking lessons or a Greek course. One of the best holiday hotels I have been to."
1482,"Nice design, intuitive operation, touch panel working efficiently. A very good idea is the possibility of mounting the power supply with a relay at the stove and the panel itself on the wall - so you do not have to think about where to hide the power supply. Now the downside: the temperature sensor protrudes outside the housing. I suppose that this is not how it was supposed to look in the original design. When wiping the dust this sensor can be damaged . Another thing is calibration . Measurement at first connection is 4 degrees apart, it is too much. I understand the degree or half but not 4 . Another drawback is the loud operation of the inverter inside the panel and the annoying buzzing of the panel which can be heard at night - even with the display switched off. The last downside is that you can't turn off the panel clicking when you press , which when you try to change the temperature at night acts like an alarm clock for the person sleeping next to you. Anyway, a cool product."
1483,"The claustrophobic rooms, basically the bed occupied the whole room. Breakfast is like in a hostel, and warm eggs, extra hot dogs, extra hot dogs - that's not what I've met in any hotel cat "" * * . * * * * * in the world. ! The ""student service"" - a collection of uninvolved in the brand Ibis random employees from Italy, Spain and other countries. Generally I don't recommend this hotel"
1484,"Mrs. Beata and her daughter came to see me after visiting many speech therapists. None of them were able to explain to me what my daughter's problem was really about. Everyone calmed down that she still has time to develop her speech until she is 3 years old, etc . Despite her reduced muscular tension, nobody noticed that my daughter's speech disorders may be due to her reduced motor skills. Mrs. Beata made us aware of the fact that her daughter at the age of 4 still does not have the language plumbing - nobody told me this before that exercises could be done from an infant. After a year of therapy we managed to catch up, the daughter was happy to go to classes but the most important thing for me was that from visit to visit you could see the effects of ""our"" work. I highly recommend"
1485,"When I was pregnant, the doctor still worked in the hospital. A fantastic expert in his field. Thanks to him, my pregnancy at risk (from 6 to 32 weeks), went as smoothly as she could. The doctor kept me informed about everything, kept me up to date, explained, did the tests. My daughter was born healthy and big. She recommended it to three friends who could not get pregnant. They are still grateful to me for recommending the doctor, and the doctor is a happy mother for that. Honest, as evidenced by the fact that if she sees from the tests that she does that a woman will not be able to have children, then she tells her that and does not draw money for additional tests. . . Thank you, Doctor."
1486,"The doctor is actually famous for his clumsy jokes, he's often nasty, but he led my pregnancy very well. And as for the delays, the Doctor comes straight from the hospital and he is not the only one who is late, for example Dr Jankiewicz is often an hour or two late. . . g"
1487,"At the Faleza Hotel we had the pleasure to host four times, at different times of the year. We were charmed by the location of the hotel, excellent attention to detail of the decor. Very nice staff. Clean, nice and tasty. And this is where the monotony creeps in. The meals are tasty and the card is obviously limited. However, nothing changes in it. Stable for years. Sometimes you'd want a change. . The overall impression, however, is very positive."
1488,"Moisture, stench and streaks on the garage ceiling, failure! ! ! The receptionist looked like some kind of creature from a horror movie. . . Dirty rooms, full of mouths and a wedding that lasted all night! ! ! The reception desk didn't even advise you about this fact! ! ! And the beach is a kilometer, not a few hundred meters. . . I honestly do not recommend it! ! !"
1489,"We strongly advise against this doctor. We've been sent to Dr. Sphere with azoospermia. The doctor considered the possible cause and made a diagnosis: infection (despite the absence of any symptoms of infection) and prescribed an antibiotic. He did not ask whether there were cases of male infertility in the family. Despite our questions about what, apart from infection, can be the cause of azoospermia, he did not say a word about genetic causes. He did not commission any tests except for another semen test. Since we have read that a common cause of azoosperm is genetic defects, we performed a deletion test on the Y chromosome (AZF) and the genetic cause was confirmed. A visit to this doctor did not bring us any closer to a proper diagnosis of the problem."
1490,"Drama. I went to see the doctor because I had abnormalities in one of the urine tests, because I tend to have very frequent bladder inflammation, I was worried that it might be something more serious. The doctor completely underestimated the results of the tests, she did not ask me about the symptoms, to my information that I still feel bad and I feel a kidney ailment she answered carelessly ""but it is certainly not from the kidneys"". She showed more interest in my sick knee, which she had in the stabilizer than in the kidneys. I understand that the internet produces hypochondriacs but in my life I didn't feel so drenched by a medical specialist. I don't recommend it!"
1491,"We had a fantastic stay at the Olive Groove Hotel, run by the family, and I can't brag about it. The accommodation, pool, food and service were excellent. This is by far the best place we've been in Greece and Elounda - and I've stayed in many places in Elounda! The family welcomed us very warmly and brothers Mano, Andreas and Mickey were perfect behind the bar. We really enjoyed the night of quizzes and barbecues, it was a great way to get to know each other and created a wonderful atmosphere for a week. This hotel is really the perfect place for couples and families. It's quiet. We have already booked a stay for next year and can't wait!"
1492,"First of all, the doctor's MA Merdas hasn't done it yet, and who knows if he'll do well to his homeboys, he'll only have to do the tasks from the letters he gives - he gives similar tasks on the wheel, as well as the tasks done on the lecture happen on the wheel, I recommend to the wheel! ! ! ! ! ! !"
1493,"The hotel is located at the inlet to the city, I drove 'em from Jelenia Gora, near a large shopping center. If you're planning on shopping, it's a good idea if you don't, it's not really where to go. I found a dirty disposable plastic glass in the bathroom in a fairly comfortable and clean room, a bottle of sparkling water in the bar (I just drink still and usually in the hotel I have a choice) and the lack of a glass to drink it, well, you can finally get out of the bottle! There is a kettle in the room and you can make yourself a coffee/tea. There is also LCD TV with a reasonable choice of channels. The staff is nice, the lady reacted immediately to a dirty glass. Well, if it wasn't for the mall, she wouldn't have a place to park, because the little hotel parking lot was collapsed, even though the reservation was with the parking lot. And so on!"
1494,"It's 11:17 p.m. My baby doesn't sleep. We don't sleep. disco / party in the courtyard . Intervention at the reception . apology . a regular change gave the room consciously from the courtyard side . Loudly, we pay a lot, we won't sleep."
1495,"We chose the hotel because our friends recommended it and did not disappoint us. It is worth noting that we lived in the four-star section. The room was clean, cleaned every day and tastefully decorated with air conditioning, so even the fact that it was in the attic did not interfere with warmer days. To the Valley of the Beautiful Lady's Throw Beret, to the centre of Eger you had to take a little walk. Indoor swimming pools were an additional plus in bad weather - in less water it was warmer and our child could go crazy at will. Different types of saunas to choose from, there were always free sun loungers. Small minus not enough varied breakfasts. Generally I recommend this hotel, we came back rested and satisfied!"
1496,In the evening and during the time of the siesta self-service hotel and you pay in front of the entrance getting a code to enter the hotel and open the room. Inside is clean and tidy. Sleeping space for 3 people . The price for a room is just over 50 € also as for the Côte d'Azur very cheap.
1497,"For a very long time she was looking for help from various specialists. My life was meaningless despite having a good job, a wonderful son and not the worst husband. However, it was difficult for me to enjoy life. I was in a constant mood swing, depression and addiction problems. She is an angel of human souls. A wonderful warm person, a specialist therapist. She is 100% involved in her work . Meeting with her has permanently changed my life. A good diagnosis, meetings, conversations, working on myself . Thanks to her, my life has changed for good and happy. She looked at them in a completely different way, she found the reasons for my bad mood and a permanent way to happiness called life. . . I highly recommend to Ms. Bożena, there are few such good specialists."
1498,"To start with, the advantages: the facility is located close to the centre. The room is clean. A clear minus is the size of the room (you have to squeeze to pass, the furniture. . . You can dream about it (only cabinets and shelves) . The bathroom is average. No glasses in the rooms, tragic breakfast. Better not to eat . Service: we found ourselves on a ""nice"" change. The second time I do not take advantage."
1499,"She wanted me to make a surprise weekend for her husband, but on average everything came out. The price is not cheap, and the quality is so self-explanatory, i.e. there is a smoking ban in the room, and when we came in, every time we smelled the smell of tobacco, after the previous guest (we are non-smokers). The kettle in the room did not work. The spa that was in the package ( terrible ) . In general, the lack of mood of the spa, constantly slamming the door, lying on the bed during the treatment, constantly jumping up and down from slamming the door, and heard m crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, flip flops masseuse, which were sticking to the floor! ! ! Massaged she had only one side of her back (and the massage was supposed to be on her whole back) she had a feeling that you were in a hurry. There is no music that I think should put you in the mood of the spa. But the lady from the face massage, excellent, wonderful. And the kitchen: REVELATION! All first class."
1500,"Hotel Panorama in Szczecin . . the only advantage of the hotel is its location. Close to the expressway, which allows for quick access to it . We already have a piece of the city. . . The hotel is old, it stopped with the decor about 10 years ago. The rooms are not very aesthetic. In the corners, spiders, cigarette smell. . . I booked a single, got 'em a 3-person room. The beds are narrow and uncomfortable. The bathroom also needs to be renovated, the shower cubicle rather scares away, especially that after letting go of water, the trunks in the shower tray started to foam. The old dryer hanging on a hook through a wrapped cable, also does not inspire optimism, especially with the smell of burning in the air after switching on. For dinner, he ordered em żurek 9 zl and pork chop with potatoes 35zl. Potatoes unfortunately heated. The taste of early boiled potatoes I always know. . . . The price for a hotel with a car park and breakfast, which is standard without any surprises is 195 PLN. For this standard it's 60 zloty for the price. I do not recommend"
1501,"I don't have the best experience with this doctor. The baby had low weight gain - she didn't make me feed my son with any milk. She kept telling me that the child does not gain weight because I am on a bad diet. After all, she ate m bread only with vegetable butter and my son was still not gaining weight. All the time he was crying and hanging by my breast and the doctor claimed that the baby had colic. It ended up with the son ending up in the hospital with hepatitis (from hunger) and a urinary tract infection. I was immediately told to feed him with nutramigen. She changed my doctor. Now the child is healthy, he is 1 or 5 years old. My doctor is on leave and today I was forced to go again to vaccinate to your doctor king. . . . Oh, horror. . . . . .she didn't want to write me a prescription for the baby for milk, claiming that there are no grounds, because the discharge from the hospital, where it is clearly written in the indications - NUTRAMIGEN! ! . . is no longer valid. . . . . .I have no words. . . . . I strongly advise against... . . ...and I've got one below. . . . ."
1502,"We were with our boyfriend for a week in Tenerife - every day we would leave the hotel for a few hours, coming back practically only for dinner. The hotel itself is small, but large rooms with a terrace, bedroom and living room with kitchen - mega. As for the pool - terribly icy water! Most of the day, the sun was shining poorly on the swimming pool area and nobody was swimming there. Better to go to the beach. The interest in the looby was supposed to work . . . . .but it's like m moved to 1995. . . 5 minutes to send a message, or opening the site is a slight exaggeration. The food - terribly monothematic - was already on the 5th day we had enough of Breton faoslka, eggs and unsavoury sausages over and over again. With lunches, as long as we used to eat them differently. Dinners were a little better. Tasty desserts, although after a few days you had enough of eating the same sweets over and over again. Great service in the looby, canteen manager - a wonderful guy! Rooms cleaned every day, people smiling forever. The animator was nice but pushy every now and then she tried to persuade everyone to play boring games such as archery or darts - when they wanted us to play darts at a different time than she let us just got banned - mega dagger rules despite the lack of interest in games. Near the hotel there is a market, car rental, travel agency for local tours. To the beach about 10 minutes walk - the one closer to the hotel unfortunately is not suitable for bathing. But, but! You do not go to Tenerife for a stay in the hotel! We visited the island in a car rental - it was mega, and even divine!"

1506,"The doctor wasn't very pleasant to take me in for a control examination of my son's hearing in Medincus in Kajetany and she made me realize that she hadn't seen my son before and she didn't know what the problem was. She directed me to an inhalation test which was supposed to last about 15 minutes and it was supposed to be done from the hand because there are no records or queues for this test, which turned out to be the test lasts about 2x after 30 minutes and for records the waiting time about 1. 5 months has led me to confusion and a lot of trouble with finding the quickest possible place to take such inhalations. I do not recommend"
1507,"Breakfast - excellent service - friendly, inclined to the customer's suggestions - possibility of extending the hotel day at the customer's request (unless the room is prepared for another customer on the same day) room - well equipped; stylish furniture ""heavy"" - personally I prefer less ""tsarist"" style. rather modern, but this is a matter of taste of the swimming pool complex - great. a good idea to put the deckchairs outside on hot summer days and make it possible to go straight from the pool to the outdoor deckchair: )"

The view on the street was busy even at night. The decor of the room was tasteless. Very low water pressure in the bathroom. It was hard to wash because the water was dripping and not flying. . . A terrible breakfast (very little choice, and warm dishes are only small sausages of poor quality. More than once we stayed in 3 star hotels and breakfast is at a very low level. . In addition, it is expensive. There is no room service which is a scandal in a 3-star hotel. It's a shame to talk. Generally I don't recommend it. And we'll never stay there again. Neither will we see each other."
1510,"We spent only one night in the hotel, which is a pity, because we would have liked to use the pool and spa. The hotel is located by the exit road from Busko-Zdrój. From the outside it is quite inconspicuous, as if industrial style. Free parking. The hotel is decorated quite modestly, but consistently, functionally and in pleasant colours. The basic rooms could be larger. Cleanliness without any problems. Very comfortable double bed and good quality bedding. In the bathroom we were happy with a platform for a child. Pleasant cosmetics . Additional duvet, bathrobes, slippers etc. in the wardrobe. Mineral water from the Buss in the room . Free, efficient Wifi . Nice service . Breakfast (Easter) rich, with live cooking, where you seemed a little lost, but it looked elegant and more importantly prepared a delicious scrambled eggs! Good coffee and juices. Wide selection of teas, muesli and additives (chia, thistle, goji seeds, etc) for yoghurt. Many traditional and regional products. On the other hand, a rather limited selection of fresh fruit and vegetables. There were no pancakes, but there was white borscht. The hotel restaurant is definitely worth a visit, the dishes from the card are excellent. During the holiday season, the youngest were thought of, in the ""orangery"" adjacent to the restaurant behind a glass door, an inflatable ""castle"" with a slide, coloring books and crayons, various ""wonders"" conjured up from balloons for children! A great idea, allowing the family to have a longer feast! I am convinced that we will come back there for a longer time."
1511,"I've been to your doctor's office twice so far, he's done me an accurate pregnancy ultrasound. My pregnancy is run by Dr. Zabielska, but she does not perform a detailed ultrasound. Maybe actually Mr. Barcikowski is very reticent, but he answered all my questions, he was very nice, he showed everything on ultrasound, he thoroughly examined the baby. She also got me some memorable pictures, with a second ultrasound probably with 10: ) So far I have no objections to your doctor."
1512,"The hotel doesn't deserve four stars at all, I have the impression that time stopped here 10 years ago. Rooms with old, heavily worn out furniture, falling off contacts, dirty and with mushroom-shaped walls, bathrobes and towels washed and stiff AZ does not want to use, radiator and heater did not work - I do not know if it's from the economy. Although outside the window in winter. At the bowling alley, a strained track - you couldn't play with the balls on the left side all the time. The lady in the lobby working probably for the punishment - no smile and no additional news - we got ice cream in chipped cups. We have the impression that the client is categorized here for better (the one who pays for each thing) and worse (the one who bought the package earlier) . Meals varied and tasty, but for vengeance to heaven's sake, the will is that you have to pay for drinks to dinner (even for tea). Nice service at the reception and very professional cleaning staff. The hotel of the years of splendor is already over - I do not recommend it to anyone and even advise against it - a pity of money."
1513,"However, as the psychologist added, even if exorcists refer the applicant to a psychiatric consultation, it often focuses on determining whether it is possible to talk about a mental illness. Meanwhile, sudden changes in behaviour and identity may be associated with completely different clinical entities, which are poorly diagnosed in Poland. ""Such a person may be more likely to suffer from dissociative disorders (related to trauma) or personality disorders,"" she says. He adds that among people redirected from exorcists there may also be neurotic people who experience conflicts over the desire for support and attention from others. And he points out that psychological help for a person will look different in each of these cases. EXORCISMS AND TRAUMAS"
1514,"Despite the late arrival, he took advantage of the alcohol offer ; ) In the morning by the pool, on bowling - everywhere nice smiles and normal atmosphere. Clean, tasty - it's a little hard to push to the theme restaurants, but I think ""after"" you know why. Hotel for demanding taste, luxury and detachment from reality. It's great!"
1515,"Stay with a family ( 2 + 1 ) I rate b well . We had a Studio room booked. Two rooms divided by a door . The equipment of the room corresponded to the stars of the hotel. On the floor carpet . Buffet breakfast, dinner served to the table - pre-determined. Luckily for the smaller children there was an option to change to a more ""childish"" dish. Spa area - the pool is fine, but the water is cold! ! This is not the case. Everyone who entered the pool made a mine as if they were entering the Baltic Sea : ) a hotel worth recommending, quiet and a little bit out of the way."
1516,"I warn everyone about this object. In July 2014 I had three rooms reserved there with private bathrooms for one night. The hotel chose em as a place to stay, returning from southern Europe to Poland. I wanted to take a bath, have dinner and get some sleep after a dozen or so hours of driving. They came to em about 20 - 21 . Before receiving the keys I had to pay for the reservation of 3 rooms according to the price given on Booking-u . After paying the bartender we were led to the rooms, the road led by narrow stairs to the floor - stairs covered with carpet which was dirty and smelled terrible. It turned out that one room with a bathroom and two rooms with a shared bathroom were waiting for us. The shared bathroom was dirty. He started to make a complaint to me . We were told that there are no other rooms and we have to wait for the owner. After more than an hour of waiting it turned out that this bartender had forgotten his English, he became an ironic wise man and turned his back on the person who tried to talk to him. On a clear and firm request to talk to the owner, he appeared before 23 . 00 . He demanded confirmation of the reservation in paper form and did not respect the electronic version. Further attempts to explain the wrong booking were unsuccessful. We were tired after 18 hours of driving and we were still 600km away from home from the early morning hours. The owner did not offer any alternative solution and compensation, we did not even receive a bill. Before midnight there was no point in looking for other places to stay. They put us to sleep. Repeated complaints by Booking do not bring any result - the owner denies his mistake. A clear mistake because there are no 3 rooms with bathrooms in the guesthouse. There are only two such rooms but he charged for three rooms with bathrooms. I warn everyone against this object. There are many beautiful guesthouses around but we saw it only in the morning when we left this town."
1517,"Glamping is a relatively young form of recreation and hosting tourists. It is a variation of the traditional campsite, but in a more sophisticated form. The emphasis is placed on luxury in accommodation and additional services. We do not send stupidity: ) As we managed to find on the website of the only / first ( ? ) facility glamping ' that in Poland - by choosing glamping: you will retain all the typical hotel comforts, gaining in addition a sense of freedom that gives unrestricted contact with nature. When designing the Tent Rooms, we focused on ensuring that our guests are as close to nature as possible without sacrificing the standard guaranteed by a good hotel or luxury guesthouse."
1518,"Much has already been written about this camping, much truth. The night, how is the night, what can you expect from mobile homes? Well, that plastic, that all you can hear, that plane cuts through the space time and again. That pool, that disco, that fittness. . . . .with the kids playing ball under your nose beating your car, squealing happily when you just want to spend the afternoon with a book : ) Today I already know you had to push to the countryside, not the nearby towns. People who like commercial, noisy and comfortable places will like it. A shop with normal prices and fresh bread is under your nose, a place to buy vegetables and fruit straight from the plantation - 2 km from the campsite. The staff was fine with us, they arrived on 8th, the one we agreed on: full acceptance: read: the cleaners checked if we cleaned well. Fortunately, we were here only for 2 nights, because we do not prefer such commercial bustling places, we took advantage of the 50% discount, so it did not hurt us. . . They treated us as gaining experience. This place is probably cool for big families with friends."
1519,"I would like to thank Dr. Christopher for taking up the task of saving my leg, which was to undergo a femoral amputation. Professionalism and great commitment of Mr. Krzysztof ended up saving a part of my leg, an amputation below the knee. All this thanks to the doctor who, apart from medical ethics, also has a huge human heart. I owe to Dr. Miller and I am very happy that I have a healthy knee that gives me freedom of movement and reduces the limitations in everyday life. Finally, she wanted to add that in addition to the physical help, she also received mental support, which played a key role in my recovery, because only he helped me to believe that it would be good."
1520,"I used Mr. Claudius' services only once, but that one time was enough for me not to come to him again. Before the visit, he told em to this doctor that he has put 2 seals on me and he put the first one in the right place, the second one no longer. Without my consent, the dentist healed the tooth, but not what he wanted 'em to. He waved 'em with his hand and left 'em. The problem is that after 5 months both fillings fell out. He wrote 'em about it to Mr. Claudius, he advertised to 'em the quality of his services, waited 'em 2 weeks, no answer. I definitely don't recommend this dentist, the form is over the content."
1521,"Tempted by many very positive opinions, I decided to choose Mrs. Doctor . Initially, em was satisfied, but with time I had more and more doubts and finally they found reliable confirmation. Let's start with the advantages . The Doctor is certainly a champion when it comes to contact with the patient. Very quickly she can catch good contact. Visiting her is a pleasure. And in this section I agree with all the other people who have given these positive opinions. Reducing the stress that is associated with such a visit is certainly a plus. However, the doctor is primarily required to be competent. Honestly, I prefer a doctor who is dry but effective. The doctor did not explain even once the exact reasons for such and not other action and the exact mechanisms of action of a given drug, despite asking precise questions. It would seem that there is simply no time for this, that it is complicated and so on. However, after more than 6 months of ineffective action, he decided to try another doctor. You could immediately see a much more ""specialist"" approach and more knowledge. He also heard em say things completely contradictory to the statements made by Dr. Malinowska - Kubiak. And disbelief at some ( incompetent ) actions of the Doctor . My new doctor solved the problem of my daily rhythm disorders in 1 month, while Mrs. Malinowska - Kubiak for 6 months only told me to ""get up early"" or gave ineffective, addictive drugs. If your problem is quite simple in terms of choosing the treatment - it is even possible that a doctor who gets good contact is a nice choice. However, if it is a more complicated problem - unfortunately, I cannot recommend it to the doctor."
1522,"I'm not happy to see this doctor. After 1 unnecessary registration and deadline, I found out on the spot that there is an ordinary queue, no need to wait for my date and time. He expected 'em to have an accurate, detailed diagnosis, but he did not receive 'em. After showing the results of the tests and telling the incomplete history of my illness because the doctor did not let me finish talking. He told 'em the opinions of other doctors, he did not agree with any, his opinion was limited to the proposal of a spinal blockade (he did not explain the possible positive and negative effects) and that the operation was unnecessary (this made me happy, here the doctor pulsed but the explanation was less than modest why, but always something). I do not recommend the doctor."
1523,"The room is a bit too small for two people, but clean and with a nice view. Tasty breakfasts . The staff and owners very nice and cordial to the guests . A place just right for families with children who have a fairy tale park and a slide on pontoons."
1524,"Meanwhile, scientists from several countries - Denmark, the USA, Belgium, Poland and Sweden - have described the hitherto unknown defence mechanisms that occur in the vaginal mucosa in contact with the herpes virus type 2 (HSV - 2). These mechanisms start to occur within the first day of the virus's appearance on the mucous membrane. Until now, as far as the vaginal mucosa is concerned, only defensive mechanisms have been known to appear 48 hours after contact with the pathogen. ""The mechanism that we examined the mucous membrane is triggered very early - even before the virus enters the cells of the body,"" says the PAP interlocutor and adds that the herpes virus is recognized at the stage of physical contact, on the mucous membrane surface.

1527,"I read these very positive opinions, she used to give them to me herself and only now I know how wrong she was and she didn't know much. Now that my son is dead, she realized to me that medicine is often helpless and doctors make mistakes. They lose their routine and conviction of their own infallibility, bordering on conceit. Because such was the case of my son. He was operated on 3 years ago by Dr. Papierz, and effectively left the hospital with the hope for further life. Soon, headaches appeared, more and more frequent and persistent. His son repeatedly visited Dr Papierz's private office, reporting the above mentioned ailments. Each time they were underestimated, associated with the psychological experience of the Son and postoperative trauma or a common cold. He did not receive any specific help, not even basic examinations were carried out. The headaches returned, making normal everyday life impossible. At the end of July and the beginning of August, he was not able to get any help. At the turn of July and August last year (one month after the visit in Dr Papierz's office) his son with the loss of consciousness and huge headache found himself again in the Department of Neurosurgery in Szp. After a CT scan it turned out that the previously established valve and ventricular drain is completely infected with bacteria, not excluding the possibility of hospital-acquired bacteria. It was necessary to remove the drain as the health condition of the son was deteriorating. The operation was performed at the beginning of August and the hospital. The operation was unsuccessful. As a result of the blood flow to the brain (approx. 400 ml), reoperation was necessary. As a result of the operation, a significant part of the skull was removed and external drainage was installed. The son's health condition deteriorated significantly after the operation, he did not move, did not make any contact with the environment, actually remained in a coma. Strong antibiotic therapy was taken in order to fight the infection, but despite the treatment, the Son's condition did not improve. We did not completely lose hope for his recovery. The fight lasted over 5 months. In December last . In December last year, an abscess was built in the place where he was operated. The digestive disorders appeared and he was artificially fed. It was getting worse every day. My son died on January 9th, b . r. although the brain work stopped about two weeks earlier. He was only 30 years old and had his whole life ahead of him. He had his Love. I will forever remain convinced that this could have been prevented, that this death could have been avoided if the right diagnosis had been made earlier, if he had been listened to, if he had been given due weight to his complains. . . . .if. . . . . . .if. . . . . . . . .if. . . . . ."

1529,"I recommend it to the doctor. We have consulted our daughter twice, because since she was 6 months old we knew that her muscular tension was lowered and when she was about a year old she was suspected of cerebral palsy. We are from another city and wanted to consult an independent neurologist in Warsaw. I am very pleased with the consultation, the doctor did a careful interview which helped us to realize certain things, she suggested further diagnostics and above all very, very carefully examined the daughter. She also suggested what exercises to do. Visits to her have always been constructive."
1530,"When it comes to pregnancy monitoring, maybe ok while the doctor couldn't distinguish between breast stasis and malignant breast cancer l , about which she found out a year after the baby was born breast-feeding. At one of the visits, the doctor assured me that it was certainly nothing wrong, in a month's time the tumor was 2 mm bigger. At that time, after the biopsy, I was diagnosed with a malignant tumour and went to a mastectomy. Was this previously undetectable? Today the doctor at the DCO avoids eye contact . . . . . .I don't recommend. ( I'm 39 years old today )"
1531,"""This method damages the tumor, not the vessels. It manages to preserve it because the current destroys the cells while not destroying collagen. The surgical method is and will remain irreplaceable, but we cannot run away from modern methods, especially where we are not able to help with the standard method"" - added prof . Lampe . The operated patient was also a scientist, lawyer, prof . Antoni Witosz . ""I have the satisfaction that he was the object on which this first operation was performed, a kind of guinea pig,"" - he joked in conversation with journalists. ""I had no doubt that I was going to undergo this operation - it was a matter of full confidence in the doctors. I feel great, I could go for a walk in the forest"", he confessed. ( PAP )"
1532,"Terrible location . Screams from the rooms, a group of teenagers drinking beer until 5 am and the staff do nothing about it. . . The walls are falling down, mushrooms in the shower and 4m high windows that cannot be opened. I don't recommend this hotel if you can call it that."
1533,The rooms are dirty. The cleaning service once a week is a fiction - limited only to throwing away the garbage. Laughter in the room . They do not react to a complaint . Someone came to wash the floor only after 5 days and it was still dirty. It's been a long time since you've seen 'em like this. Absolutely not recommended.
1534,"Looking for a hostel for May, just this one appeared to me at the very beginning, looked at my pictures, thought I - great, modern hostel, average price, but the quality and location pays for itself. In fact, the wonderful hostel was a total misunderstanding. For a 4-day stay, not once did we have hot water. An external failure was not a problem, but we did not get any compensation for it, and the discussion with the owner turned into a big brawl, during which arguments such as ""no hot water, it is not yet a tragedy, well, that she is at all ""cold shower is good for health. When one of us started to argue that the withdrawal of the payment transaction (to reduce the fee) is possible and the refusal of the refund is not entirely legal, we heard ""you tell me that your dad is a lawyer! "" . In addition to water problems, there was an ubiquitous mess (the cleanliness of the bathrooms was terrifying), a mushroom on the ceiling (which, by the way, was falling off) of the room and a problem with breakfasts (you should have come right at the beginning of the meal, or preferably before you eat WHOLEVER; it is worth mentioning that the quality and variety of this meal left much to be desired). To sum up, writing on behalf of the four students who wanted to spend their Mayday in a fairly decent hostel, I can say that the object in question is a total TRAVEL!"
1535,"A very pleasant hotel, located in a slightly gloomy area, but when you enter it, it doesn't really matter. Many parking spaces, a great and well equipped wellness area. Very good massage. The only small minus - a small swimming pool, typically recreational - was enough for us, but for those who like a little more swimming it could be a problem. Very close to the Market Square and the Castle. We were there in winter, but you can see immediately that in summer it would be much more pleasant there - for example, the arbor by the restaurant is very large and in the green must look impressive. In general, the hotel is certainly worth recommending!"
1537,"Very nice day's stay. The room is clean and very cozy . Parking directly underneath the homestead, closed for the night . Delicious dinner in the restaurant and also very good breakfast. Ovaries, fried eggs or sausages are made to order, vegetables, fresh bread, cold cuts, etc... . . . . .all great. We recommend it: )"

1539,"First impression after entering the hotel is not bad. She knew we wouldn't have a room with a sea view because you had to pay for one. When the curtains were removed, an explosion of laughter - a view of the roof of something underneath us (1st floor) and bushes. In the room the fan, which was spinning so slowly that it did not bring any relief, and a terrible smell, from the south in the sauna room. You have to pay for air conditioning, which is pathetic these days. Despite this, we tried it, unfortunately, the stench that came out of it was associated with the smell of chewing, an unbearable smell! There was a fridge in the room, but it was almost uncool. The kettle was dirty inside, and the smell that came from it made us not use it even once. The water from the tap in the kitchen flew along with the sand! Not for a while, all the time. But still the worst thing was the toilet flush - after one flush you had to wait about 10 minutes for the water to fill up again and you could use it. As far as the cleaning service is concerned, I do not know what the cleaning ladies were doing there, but they certainly did not clean ! ! The floors didn't sweep once, there was a lot of sand everywhere, it's good that there was a broom and although we could do it ourselves. There is a lot of shit under the bed, which means that for a long time no one exactly sweeped or vacuumed it. The brune mirrors haven't been washed even once. The towels were changed, but I was damned if they were left on the bidet. And still the bed - the bedspread that was covered with our bed was so dirty that we immediately threw it on the floor. It looked as if the pzrez wasn't washed all summer long: stains, unpleasant to the touch, rough, in a word disgusting! And the bedding, how was it changed? Well, the pillow was dragged to the left side. A failure on the whole line ! As for the food, it was nasty. Really unpleasant, medium choice. Even the fries didn't taste like it, dried out and rubberized, from the oven. Once under the table, a piece of fish fell off me, all week long it was still there, nobody cleaned it, nobody washed the floor. The only plus is the location of the hotel."
1540,"According to the Gdansk University of Technology, thanks to the appropriate blocks, the child cannot move on to the next activity until he or she has completed the currently displayed task. The software can be installed on mobile devices with the Android operating system. Thanks to this it is possible to use activity plans also outside the therapeutic centre. ""This is especially important for people who may need to use this type of instruction for the rest of their lives. A person who moves and uses a bulky, large binder during various life activities looks eccentric and pays attention to his or her dysfunctions. Nowadays, however, using mobile devices such as tablets and laptops is quite natural"" - says Dr. Eng. Agnieszka Landowska ."
1541,"Mr. Tomasz made an accurate diagnosis, which was confirmed by the MRI. ACL rupture . He performed a reconstruction procedure . Everything went without any problems. The climate in the operating room was very nice and the possibility of watching a live broadcast from the inside of his own knee was invaluable : ) My goal was to return to work 3 months after the surgery and so it happened. At his own risk, in 2 months after the surgery, he started to ride a bike in the field and at the end of the surgery, he flowed 1km an hour in the pool. Today, a year after the treatment I go out for a walk with my dog and son, such 15km and when my son gets tired I take him on a ram and we go on. My leg will sometimes give you a chance to know about it but after that everything is git. Recently a second son was born to me and also became a patient of the Doctor. Doctor Tomasz can explain the treatment process and answer every question. If someone is looking for an orthopedist, let him finish his search and make an appointment with Dr. Tomek."
1542,"He informed that discussions are being held on the establishment of a medical faculty at the University of Opole; he expressed the hope that they will be completed successfully. Then - as the Deputy Minister pointed out - all provincial cities in Poland will have universities where doctors will be educated. He admitted that the system of educating past doctors is very complicated, however, our graduates of medical studies meet all international criteria, our universities are accredited in the United States, so that Polish doctors do not have any problem with getting a job in the West. Pinkas emphasized that we are seen as a country that educates doctors in an excellent way, which is also the reason that they are often ""sucked out"" abroad."
1543,"I'll start with the positives: very nice contact with the child. And that's it. Completely wrong diagnosis in terms of ears. No endoscopic tools to make a correct diagnosis. When asked about it, the doctor said the equipment was in the operating room. Therefore, the whole examination consisted of questioning the child, which at the age of 4 and serious hearing problems is not very productive. We were also instructed to go and do some tympanometry, which should normally be done on a visit. However, for a 150 PLN visit we expect more. The doctor said that the child hears well and ears are in good condition. And the child hears only when he speaks with his voice raised strongly, so something is wrong. A visit to a good laryngologist and an endoscopic examination a few days later showed fluid in the ears, an oversized third almond and severely impaired hearing. I do not recommend it."
1544,"For the money that the doctor takes for every nod, he really doesn't do the grace of telling you what's going to happen in time or how to proceed after a procedure. When he talks about costs, he gives the price fork, and after the procedure he calls the upper half, which sometimes overshadows by several hundred zlotys. It would most willingly be taken care of by another dentist, but, as we know, you can ""from the rain under the gutter"". The fact is, however, that it does not pass in this office in the waiting room of another patient."
1545,"Inconvenient, such a fat one-handed operation is not possible, two-handed operation is also not very suitable - the rear vents are covered. Loud, flies like a slaughtered pig. It is impossible to turn the head so that the switch is in a comfortable position. Plastic bottom of both gears, on the side of the shield, where the bearing sits. The only positive thing to do is to conveniently and thoughtfully change the position of the shield. It is a push button, for a black hour. He bought em Makita GA5030 and AEG WS 6 - 125, each cost less than this greenery and are with 5 times better."
1546,"We were going away for a longer weekend with our friends to rest, to come down the mountains and have a nice time, and we came back angry, deceived and I was additionally beaten, because I slipped on the unprotected stairs in the pool and fell from them. Of course the hotel does not feel any responsibility. The advance payment made to the reservation by our friends cut in and they had to pay this amount for us and we were treated as fraudsters. The food was terrible, the cheapest and the lowest quality food, undecorated and tasteless. As a result, it ended up with a stomach and intestinal ailments. In a word, it's an embarrassment to me and I do not recommend this hotel in any way."
1547,"Maybe that painter helped somebody. For us it was just a waste of time going to see him for six months. Nothing was done towards further diagnosis of the son / kidney problems, examinations done during the stay in the children's hospital /, the pediatrician at the outpatient clinic worried about standing still proposed to change the specialist. They listened to us and it turned out that another doctor on the basis of the same test results found something different from Dr. Ratajczak, it gave us to think and so the other two doctors confirmed in agreement something different from Dr. Ratajczak. Fear to think how this doctor could harm my child. . . ."
1548,"We went to Madeira in March. A very successful trip, a beautiful picturesque island. The hotel met our expectations. A clean, neat hotel for a decent price. If someone was accommodated in a 2 standard room it may have different feelings a little tight and you can hear the neighbors but it is clean and not the worst conditions. We chose an apartment with sea views for an extra charge and were very pleased with the peace and quiet and beautiful sea view. Average food, especially dinners here can give a small minus. Location of the hotel in a very good place with access to the sandy yellow beach (which is rare in Madeira) in the town of Machico - good access to communication, you can also rent a taxi (which is not missing here next to the hotel) and for a good price to visit the island. I would return to this hotel once again."
1549,"Great hotel in Katowice . Modern, stylish . Clean room with large bathroom . Nice, competent and helpful staff. The price is adequate and would even say low in relation to quality. We came in the evening after 6 pm. . . .the queue at the reception was up to the main exit. The lady from the reception desk was very polite. It would be advisable to have one more person at the reception desk (at least during rush hour) is such a suggestion to the manager, the location is great. The only downside is that there is no possibility of ironing in the room you have to run around the hotel with your clothes to iron them : ) The hotel is recommended for couples for a romantic weekend, arrivals, business meetings and families with children: )"
1550,"Dr. Łątkowski operated on my nose about 5 bears ago. I am very pleased with the result, the nose is beautiful and natural, I really recommend it. I went to the doctor myself on the recommendation of a colleague from the USA who did the surgery on him earlier. The doctor is professional, with a sense of humor which helps to get through the convalescence. The office is clean and neat so that he feels safe there. Goroco recommends if someone decides to have a nose job!"
1551,"Using a printer, the PŁ unit applies electrically conductive ink - which may contain e.g. silver compounds - to the surface of non-wovens or fabrics and activates it accordingly. Thanks to this solution the electrodes adhere well to the skin and the user has no problem with applying and removing them. Apart from that no parts of the electrodes stick out of the clothes and this was a problem in case of other ways of connecting the electrodes with clothes. As prof . Krzysztof Gniotek points out that such textile electrodes could be used e.g. in orthoses (used for joint damage), socks or shirt pullers. The most important application of electrodes would be to use them in electrotherapy - there the electrodes must remain on the patient's body for a longer time, so hiding them in clothes could be more comfortable for the user."
1553,"The long ones were looking for accommodation in Zakopane but far away from the noise and busy streets. She found me apartments in glass houses . The price is like a room and you get an apartment with 1 or 2 bedrooms, a mini living room with a large kitchenette and dining area and a large bathroom. Clean and warm. Good quality equipment, very comfortable beds. Breakfast very tasty! At the cost of the distance to the city center (about 3km) we received a great apartment at a low price. WE RECOMMEND !"
1554,"The hotel makes a very good impression, nice decoration, nice service. The room is great, there's nothing to attach to. We were only disturbed by small ""faults"". The following are the small things, such as the wobbly handle in the bathroom door, the lack of towels in the pool, the lack of boiling water at breakfast and such small things, which altogether were a little bit, but disturbed to a small extent. To praise me, I added coffee in the hotel cafe, which was delicious. Because of the whole thing, it was 4, so it was quite good."
1555,"We came here by chance and we fell in love, in a homely atmosphere, cosy and clean interiors, wonderful peaceful surroundings and silence on mountain trails. As we are townsfolk who love mountains, but also the comfort and tranquility of the hotel Górski Raj is perfectly suited to our needs, we rest here several times a year and always leave relaxed and satisfied. We highly recommend it for families with children. Bartek, Igor, Basia and Olek Pear: )"
1556,"Dr. Maciej was told by my sister-in-law that I am approaching a standard frenulum cutout. Such guidelines were given to her by another periodontist who did not see any contraindications to the procedure. She was very lucky that she did not get under the scalpel of this doctor because the procedure, according to Dr. Nowiński, could have ended in an aesthetic failure and a big hole in the gum between one and two. With his professional eyes, the doctor assessed that my case is not standard at all, it requires double reflection as well as consultation with an experienced periodontist and redirected me to his trusted specialist colleague in the field. In all of this Dr. Nowiński showed great patience, answering all my questions and doubts. The visit, even though my case is now proving to be quite complicated, was a pleasure for B"
1557,"The daughter has been the Doctor's patient for 2 years. So far I have been very satisfied with the treatment, attitude and personality of the Doctor. Unfortunately, about 2 - 3 weeks ago, due to the lack of contact, she sent a phone call to the Doctor asking for an urgent visit, because the child's condition deteriorated and in addition had bad test results. Unfortunately, until today she did not get an answer. She took the advice of another doctor. All day yesterday she tried to call the Doctor, she was recording me at the post office because the baby got worse again and it happened that she was scratched to the blood and barely saw the eyes. Finally another doctor helped us. I am disappointed with the Doctor's passivity, the more so that you have time to respond to the comments. Disappointed Mom"
1558,"As Dr. Rudnicka points out, more and more consumers are looking critically at what they are buying and paying attention to how it is produced and how it impacts the environment. Therefore, the demand and supply of organic products continues to grow and their prices are falling. The market for organic products is also growing and nowadays, instead of looking for e.g. organic food in specialist shops, it is increasingly possible to buy it in local shops. ""As more and more of these products are available on the market, their price is starting to decrease, thus achieving economies of scale. Considering the last few years, these are the products whose prices have come close to or even equalled those of conventional products"" - noted Dr Rudnicka."
1559,"Great hotel, excellent meals, nice service, clean, elegant as befits a hotel. close to the sea, the city. Every Friday a great attraction ""Greek Evening"" with live music, excellent regional Greek food, Greek excellent wine from nearby vineyards. Whoever comes here will not complain and will not be bored. I recommend"
1560,"Let's start with the food: DENMARKS: generally modest but fresh, only wheat bread, poor quality coffee, and most importantly: when you come 30 minutes before the end, there is nothing to eat - and the waitress asked to report, I politely inform you that they have nothing left - Sorry! DINCIPOLATIONS: not at all suitable for children, because they do not like Humus, zucchini reigned for 3 days in a row, all the dishes tasted similar, not expressive and not seasoned. - Generally, I do NOT recommend staying with an option with dinners. Pool: be careful, water with chemicals that irritate the eyes - the children could cry, falling tiles in the pool, no lifeguard - VERY LOW! SAUNY: Finnish and aromatic - ok . INFRARED - does not work ."
1562,"It can only be assumed that if it had not been for Euro 2012, taking into account the average increase in the number of trips expected by the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) this year of 4%, in June our country's accommodation base would have benefited from approx. 486 thousand foreign tourists. Therefore, additional traffic caused by Euro 2012 would amount to only 60 thousand tourists. It can be added for the sake of protection that the data of the Central Statistical Office are underestimated because they do not take into account those tourists who stayed in private flats, apartments or accommodation facilities which are not in the Central Statistical Office database. In fact, foreign tourists in June this year could have been a few, several thousand more."
1563,"I strongly advise against it! ! ! ! I have the worst possible feeling about this lady. I don't knowingly call her a doctor. This ""super grandmother"" as you call her when you examine my mom at Wawelska Street, she was crouching and moaning, and I quote, ""yuck. She was impatient and she was very insensitive. I would add that my mother was seriously ill with cancer and felt terribly humiliated. A week later on the phone ( ! ) she told my mother to get herself a hospice. Then we went to the Oncology Centre in Ursynów - there we found many fantastic doctors. And there she learned from the staff many not interesting things about Mrs. Kozakiewicz. . I will not write about it here because I am not sure if it is true. For me this lady should work in a slaughterhouse and not in a hospital. And if this lady ever looks at this forum, I recommend that you read the Hippocratic oath again and read at least half a book on psychology. Then maybe you will stop hurting the patient and treat them like cannon fodder."
1564,"Trilogies too. The book is the last volume of the Hussite Trilogy and it would be said that the end ends with the work, but . . . Well, that's right. The author probably exaggerated. He multiplied the threads in the second part and added more and more, and trying to close them all in one volume, he got terribly excited about the action. Every page on the main character lurks a new danger, it is so full of it that the novel, instead of being drawn in, starts to irritate. I admit frankly, when in one chapter the main character was every and every move by someone kidnapped, my irritation reached a boiling point. Well, how much can you? ! Yes, as if Sapkowski tried to break the record in the accumulation of climaxes per page of text . These adventures, into which he put his protagonist, would have been enough for two volumes instead of one, and thanks to that the reading would not be annoying instead of happy. No novel can consist only of climaxes, it harms the reader, like an excess of candy in the diet, and a similar effect - the reader overeats and that's it. Fortunately, there are also good sides to it. Our hero finally grows up, gets bearable, sometimes he even gets to like himself. The historical background is still great, you can still see an in-depth knowledge of the author. The language of the novel is simply excellent, the descriptions of the horrors of war are stuck in the memory. And what has fun, is fun. The fantasy is also a little bit more, as if in previous volumes. In a word, everything would be fine if the author did not exaggerate with the climaxes."
1565,"I was with the Doctor only on one visit, so she decided to make a neutral comment. However, I think she found me on her bad day. I think she scared me unnecessarily. A conversation and other gynaecologist and articles from the doctors' magazine made me sure that ectopy, (often called incorrectly), was a physiological condition. The second issue was my feelings and doubts about whether I could be pregnant. The doctor said that it was very unlikely and not referring to any tests that would give such certainty - she prescribed the medicines about which the leaflet was read in order not to use in pregnancy, which as it later turned out was m . Therefore, I advise you to trust your intuition and if in doubt, consult another specialist."
1566,"I advise against it. Despite the really nice decoration full of flavors (and some Ikea bushes too ; ) . My adventure is the lack of hot water and march out of the hotel to meet without a morning shower. Rancid foods (olives asked em to sacredly insulted Mr. Waiter to abolish because you were really going to poison yourself) . The omelette resembled . . . . .no. . . The omelette resembled nothing in particular, neither in appearance nor in taste. For a while after writing the protocol, the owner was supposed to contact me (we already talked during this unlucky visit and she personally promised me). It didn't work out despite my call with a reminder (I was very curious how the hotel would approach such an accident) - you called from the staff with a proposal of 20% discount for the next visit. When he asked 'em if it's as much as they give on the booking it got a little quiet. Sad and funny ."
1567,"Mr. Lembas is an amazing man ! She noticed at the first consultation how Mr. Dr. Lembas approaches the patient - he describes everything exactly, he is patient, he can listen and give advice, so he behaves like every doctor should - full professionalism! In addition, he is a very warm and nice man. Less than two weeks ago, she had her nose completely plastered with a septum. I must admit that the effect is great for such a complicated surgery and the time that has passed after the surgery. I don't have anything to stick to: ) The nose fits the whole face, is not artificially tiny and is 100% in line with my expectations (although it is still slightly swollen). I am glad that she chose m Dr. Lembas, it was the best choice - she confirmed to me that this is a top class surgeon! Greetings to you and I recommend it ! : ) Aleksandra K ."
1568,"I have just come back from holidays in this hotel and after analyzing the whole stay I can say with a clear conscience that the hotel does not deserve 5 stars at most a strong 3, 5 stars (the staff itself admits that this is a 4 star hotel). Clean rooms are cleaned daily. The only downside is the blocked air conditioning (centrally controlled - you can only turn it on and off). There is also no dvd, which according to the description is in the room (this did not bother us because the holiday also belongs to the television). The swimming pools located in the hotel are small but with a lot of chlorine. CateringMonitorial Breakfast is monotonous but as in most hotels. Dinners served in the main restaurant if someone likes fast food is ok (always fries, peree, no groats, rice.). Repeated menus such as chicken, spaghetti, casserole etc. every day. The advantage is a large selection of salads and ripe fruits (oranges, watermelons, melons, cherries, strawberries, peaches, bananas, apples, fruit salad). Dinner repeat dishes from lunch only with a small modification. What is not eaten during lunch is processed and served again (on the one hand, the food is not wasted, but for a hotel like a 5-star hotel, such things should not take place rather). Thematic dinners for which you have to sign up at the reception desk are not a revelation - because they are served the same as in the main restaurant. The same thing is true for the Italian, barbecue and Greek dinners. The corner of the children's food is visible - but I personally saw 'em there eating only once for the children during the week and it was the same as for adults. Aqua park is probably raised by it is the hotel standard to 5 stars . Slides super very safe . The staff rigorously follows the growth of the child who can take advantage of the attraction. The rapid river is cool, but I wouldn't recommend using it right away from the opening, because we saw the dwarfs pouring in from the big chlorine canisters in the morning, smell unpleasant, so let the chlorine mix a little bit with the water. Eating in the bar is good although sometimes the pizza dough with very much yeast. Ask for warm French fries best served straight from the kitchen, as those at the bar are often cool and tasteless soaked in oil. Fruit salad is very good, large pieces of fruit."
1569,"She didn't have a surgery with Dr. . Obidzinski, which I am very happy about. I am a young girl with fast moving deformity of her feet . As a result of parents' negligence, she did not wear my orthotics as a child and then it was too late. The orthopaedist to whom I went for a consultation without any doubts directed me to a corrective procedure, ensuring that it will essentially improve not only the aesthetics of the feet, but also the comfort of life (discomfort with long walking, spinal pains, problem with choosing shoes). Unfortunately, Dr . Obidzinski not only was of a different opinion, but also expressed it in a very obsessive way. At first he told me very vividly about the worst sides of the procedure, which I was able to understand because of the patient's duty to make her aware. However, I felt that he wanted to intimidate me more than to make me aware of it. When I decided to undergo the procedure, the doctor suggested that some patients would need a psychiatrist instead of a foot deformity procedure. Because they live in the conviction that if they ""repair"" their feet, they will finally find the only one, or maybe it is not the feet that are the problem? As a result, I was not only intimidated, but humiliated. Clearly, the doctor has no idea about the daily painful imprints on the feet and the pain in the foot, which is the result of progressive deformation (despite wearing insoles). I went to the doctor with a source of health problems and complexes - my feet are really bent, and the doctor decided to level the young girl, the patient with the floor level. She didn't decide to have a surgery with Dr. . Obidzinski ."
1570,"I don't think she's spending much time with me and I don't really feel like she cares about the patient. She has never answered my question specifically yet, or she answers me so strangely, passing by. I'm not entirely satisfied. But I have to survive to the end of the pregnancy. But despite everything, I think she has knowledge."

Antibiotic in the last resort . My son is allergic and she is also a pulmonologist . He is in favor of the baby's natural nutrition ( no jars and artificially colored porridge ) . The baby is most important . In general I have a very good opinion about the Sanus clinic, e.g. if your doctor doesn't have room for today, they will certainly not leave you unattended (another doctor will accept you). The only downside is the ladies in the registration. . . especially one very rude one. . . . .always arrogant and dissatisfied with life. . . . . . .and in a private clinic there is no room for such behaviour. . . The director should think about such staff."

Thanks to the research commissioned by him, she reached the causes of my bad mood where she wouldn't look for them and the treatment he chose was effective. The doctor treats all the patient's signals with attention, always performs check-ups and answers all questions in detail. Each of the visits took place at my convenience, chosen by the portal, or after making an appointment with Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr.'s assistants. The consultations last as long as the situation requires. As a patient I always feel listened to and taken seriously. Dr. Jędrzejko deserves trust and in the future I will also seek advice from him.

1574,"The largest number of overnight stays in the discussed half-year was provided in hotels - 11.3 million, health resorts - 4.1 million, holiday resorts - 2.7 million, other hotel facilities - 2.0 million and training and recreation centres - 1.5 million. The GUS announcement reads. ""A vast majority (80.5%) of foreign tourists visiting Poland in the first half of 2012 chose, as in the same period last year, to stay in hotels. This was the case most often for guests from such countries as : USA - 90 , 6% . Italy - 88.6%.

1575,"Ewa Bieniak is a very competent person in what she does. I am a very difficult patient with a long list of food allergies, diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, coeliac disease and from time to time insulin resistance. She came across Eve 4 years ago, she helped me a lot and taught me how to eat properly. After a few years she came back to me with the problem of food allergies. The meals proposed in the diet are really tasty, easy to prepare and most importantly, the diet prepared by Eve shows that despite numerous limitations I do not have to eat lettuce leaf and drink it with water. By the way, she wanted me to write that out of curiosity, she consulted me with a few nutritionists, who have been successful in their breakfast programs, who crossed out my case claiming that they do not take up the case because I'm too difficult a patient. Fortunately, Eve is not only super professional but also not afraid of challenges."
1576,"The doctor is a very good specialist. I know because I've been her patient myself for a few years. And she really helps me. I'm on medication and thanks to it, I don't have any epilepsy attacks and it functions normally. She recommends me a lot of tests to do but it's for my own good. I really recommend this doctor and I am very happy with her parents ; )"
1577,"A small inn quite far from the centre . Rooms in a separate building . The room itself clean but cool and very wet . The bathroom, unfortunately, definitely needs to be refreshed and reheated - damp enough that the towels have not dried out overnight and the water from the flow-through heater - not too warm and a tiny shower pressure. A kettle would also be useful in the room. Tasty breakfast ."
1578,"She was a m... . . . .and I don't understand negative opinions about the hotel. I'm very happy with my stay at the hotel. I think I'll go there next year, too. The food is good, fresh and there's something to choose from. There are regular dishes: broth, pancakes, but for me it's a plus, because there are many children who eat only these dishes (besides regular dishes there are many others, everyone will find something good for themselves). My son when he was in the primer was a year old, he ate with appetite and he was fine. The rooms are clean, no mushrooms, cleaned regularly, the hotel decor, a little bit not in my climate, but neat and tidy. A paradise for children, despite the bad weather my children were not bored, lots of attractions. Spa ok . The reception staff is nice. Hotel without any problems - I sincerely recommend! ! !"
1579,"My first and last meeting with the doctor. The visit in a hurry, I had to ask for everything myself. The study was carried out quickly and in medium comfort. After a private visit, which costs quite a lot, she expected me to have a better interview, give more information, or even a breast examination. At the visit I felt as if the doctor wanted to finish as soon as possible. As far as substantive knowledge is concerned, it is certainly on a high level (as in any specialist doctor...). However, the doctor, especially in such a specialization, should be more contactable and empathetic. I do not recommend it to the doctor."
1580,"Astoria is a hotel well located in the center of Lviv. The most important advantages beyond the location? Cleanliness, great service, free wi-fi, good bar, comfortable beds and ... . rare toilet : ) Do not laugh, but the toilets in this hotel are ahead of their time. These are the latest electric models, combined with a bidet. They have lighting and heating. Wonderful! The staff speaks a bit of Polish, there are several Polish channels in the cable. In general, the reception of Poles in Lviv is great! It's better to speak Polish than to try to force yourself into broken Russian. Everyone who hears Polish immediately smiles and is eager to help. Minuses of Astoria? The rooms could be bigger and the breakfasts more varied. Generally a hotel worth recommending ."
1581,"The hotel is well located, close to the highway, which made it easy to get to the Essen fairgrounds. Prices are balanced, restaurant in the hotel - ok, next to the Mc donald like someone needs a quick coffee: P and Pont restaurant, which also serves good food. Internet without reservations. Cleanliness maintained properly. Good breakfasts. Nice and helpful service."
1582,"You want to get robbed in broad daylight? Gdansk and Hotel Bonym invites you. For the alleged 3 stars and almost 300 PLN per day there is no breakfast and no air conditioning. If someone wants to throw money in the mud, it is better to set fire to the barbecue. It will be a better use than accommodation in Bonum Hotel. Cheaper hotels have air conditioning. Summary: the hotels either focus on the quality of service and encouraging customers to come back, or maximize the loser's cheating because he won't come back anyway. If it was possible to give zero stars then I would give it."
1583,"The Centre for the Treatment of Obesity and Metabolic Diseases opened on Monday at the Centre for Invasive Medicine of the Medical University of Gdansk ( GUMed ) . The University assures that it will be ""a unique unit in which the patient will be cared for by top class specialists throughout the entire path of treatment of metabolic diseases and obesity - from the moment of qualification and preparation for surgery, surgery and post-operative care"". Social ombudsman for the rights of people suffering from obesity in Poland, President of the Foundation OD - WAGA Magdalena Gajda there is no doubt that such centres are needed in Poland, because ok . 70% . Poles are overweight or obese. ""It's about 26-27 million people,"" she added. She said that the country is ok. There are 30 bariatric surgery centres (surgical treatment of obesity), which perform surgeries reimbursed by the National Health Fund. ""We have only 8% of primary care physicians who know what obesity is about,"" she added. She stressed that the Centre will deal not only with patients with huge obesity who require surgical treatment, but also with patients who are overweight or suffer from obesity of the 1st and 2nd degree, for whom it is necessary to implement long-term treatment."
1584,"The hotel is pleasant. However, in our case we liked the bathroom more than the room. The two beds were less comfortable and nice than the double bed seen in another room. However, they say that the employees of the companies are staying there overnight and in this parakeet we understand their unwillingness to sleep in a shared bed. Besides, it is nice, quiet and the world can hardly be seen from behind the windows: there is a parking lot on one side and a garden on the other. The gallery of guests who were here is impressive: photographs, autographs are beautifully displayed on the wall at the reception."
1585,"A wonderful stay just before Easter. Lots of activities for children, swimming pool, monkey grove, animations, playgrounds, ponies. The food is delicious and the choice is huge. It was hard to get hungry for another meal. Home-made bread with oil, home-made cakes with pride. Coffee, tea and cake was for breakfast and would also be useful after lunch. Jacuzzi baths, great spa treatments super relaxing. The rooms are clean and comfortable. We travelled as a family of five and had two connected rooms, so it wasn't crowded. Overall the stay was very successful and certainly not the last."
1586,"General impressions . . . . .unforgettable . Decoration . . . . .because the style of this thing simply cannot be called. . . . . . .a combination of Russian design and colouring with Louis VI with an admixture of Marilyn Monroe . . . . .by the way, the bidulka in the grave is falling. . . The equipment - unscrewed handles, a scratched mirror, swollen floor panels, a mushroom in the shower cubicle and the ubiquitous ""smell"" of it with an admixture of sewer stench. In fact, it discouraged me enough to stay there longer. I could still write about the architect's general vision of dubious legitimacy. . . . .because he hasn't seen 'em in his life. . . Dry fountains and dry ponds in the spaces under the stairs also complete the ""style"" of an interior architect . They also told 'em on the phone that the hotel has a parking lot. I found me a hole in the place. . . Of course, unguarded . Massacre . . . I wouldn't recommend it."
1587,"A very nice man with a professional approach to the pacifier. He diagnosed the cause of my ailments . Unlike some doctors, he looks at the man as a whole and does not just focus on one fragment. I decided to visit Mr. Luke because my knee had been bothering me for a long time and then I had a leg ache. The orthopaedist went the easiest way and found that it was a degeneration of both knees, although it bothered one thing and prescribed quite a bit of expensive glucosamine, that the suppression that only this one is the medicine and works and the rest are supplements. As for the leg, he said that it was probably radiating from the cough and only prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug. Thanks to Mr. Luke, I know what's wrong with me and that the problem lies in my hip dysfunction and abnormal muscle function. He applied needle therapy, the method is not the most pleasant but it is bearable and effective. It was better after the first treatment. In addition to this there is also auto-therapy and learning exercises selected for the patient in order to achieve the intended and long-lasting effect, and not just a temporary improvement. Thanks to this I know how to help myself and prevent recurrence of ailments. It's really worth going to Mr. Luke, and not wasting your time on neutral treatment and spending money on drugs that don't work."

She went to the dermatologist and prescribed me an ointment which slowly fixes the oil's mistakes. In my opinion she only lost me money. The only advantage is that the oil is very moisturizing so a person who has dry skin should definitely be satisfied with it."
1590,"You can always complain about something. . . . . .and the small rooms and the elevators aren't there, you have to wait a little bit for hot water. . . . Oscar is a place with a nice atmosphere, always smiling and nice owner, clean rooms. There's also something special that you won't find easy to meet is DESIGNATION. Tasty made with great culinary inventiveness and every day different. I recommend."
1591,"At the very beginning of the visit the doctor did not know what kind of anaesthesia to use and she was looking for a hint with me. During the filling in she hesitated what kind of anaesthesia to use and often used the word ""maybe"" . She did not find out how many teeth I have to cure because she did not analyze my teeth and did not notice that I have a crown. In the picture, she mistook the 6 and 7 and immediately found out that I have a root canal tooth to treat, which I already have cured. She did not feel that I am in professional hands. I do not recommend it."
1592,"The biggest advantage of this hotel is its location. A short distance from Olsztyn, by a lake in the forest. For those who want peace and quiet it would seem to be an ideal place. Attention not during holidays. In July 2015, colonies were organized there. This excludes peace and quiet rest and all related problems. The total disorder and mess, the lack of organization and many things at the interface of endurance, are almost breaking up. The owner has one remedy for this. The adhesive tape, which is bound to practically everything that starts to break down. There's billiard, ping-pong and bowling dirty and a lot of stuff broken. Swimming pool and sauna pretty only in the pictures. Eating when someone is late is going to run out. Generally I do not recommend. Stanisław"
1593,"The training will be conducted by Krzysztof Głąbiński , President of Yieldplanet.com . The training cycle in Poland begins with the program ""Revenue Management - All Its Aspects"" . It is addressed to hotel owners, hotel managers, directors and managers as well as sales, marketing and Revenue Managers and people thinking about their own accommodation facilities. It is a complete course for every hotelier who explains what Revenue Management is, what his or her place in the hotel is, what measures, how it counts and how it translates into tactical and strategic hotel behaviour. For those interested, there is an official exam which, if passed, entitles them to receive a training certificate issued by EI."
1594,"The device is suitable for children, it does not affect the number of adjustment options available. Quite inconvenient to navigate through folders . My unit has had a problem with the CD player from the very beginning - the curved arrangement of the media mounting causes discs to be drawn and noisy playback caused by friction of the disc. The problem has been reported to an authorized service center, I hope to have it repaired in an efficient way. The sound quality is very good for this class of device. The device bought 'em for children to learn languages and listen to audiobooks, which seems to be very good for this class. Besides, the external power supply reduces the device's own weight when using battery power ."
1595,"In my case, it looked like this: The Doctor cured me effectively from a skin allergy attack, but I have to admit that I have never met such an unsympathetic and naughty doctor in my life. I was in her hospital, not in her private office, maybe that's why she treated me like that, although from what I read, it's normal. She rode me from top to bottom for, in her opinion, the most neglected allergy in the world, so far I don't know what she meant. How can you ""take care of"" an allergy so that it doesn't appear? If she knew the secret, she wouldn't have to be condemned to doctors as disapproving as her. I have to say I've been suffering from atopy since I was a child and I know everything about care and treatment. Mrs. Lisa scared me with her vision of hair loss and other such encouraging images. She managed to make me cry in this office, and my husband said that you could hear her stomachs all over the hallway. I don't say anything about the professionalism, I have to admit that the drugs were hit, but I'm not going to visit this lady anymore. I still remember that visit, and a few good years have passed. . . Now I am visiting a doctor who is not only competent but also nice. I understand that a doctor is not a therapist, he does not have to be overly sympathetic and effeminate, but everything has its limits. . ."
1596,"I DISCOURAGE IT! ! ! I would like to remind you that a doctor who has achieved but is not very INTERESTANT and treats a sick person like a man who is not just a circle of experts in his professional career. THE ""PROFESSOR'S"" APPROACH CAN BE CHANGED WHEN THE PATIENT PAYS, AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR THE ADDITIONAL ""MEDICAL CONSULTATION"" THAT LASTS ""AS LONG AS THE HEN LAYS GOLDEN EGGS""."
1597,The Doctor's very kind and friendly. I was at her place with a child who was not the quietest and she explained to me in a very calm and concrete way what to do. For the time being I'm putting out a good one because I don't know what the effects will be. I'd like to go to your doctor again.
1598,"The only hotel group that has seen a decline is the German TUI Hotels & Resorts. Its potential has decreased by 3 hotels with 835 rooms, which is related to the sale of hotel properties by partner companies to TUI in the crisis of Greece and Spain. ""The European market has become the victim of a permanent restructuring that is leading to the elimination of thousands of obsolete rooms that no longer respond to market needs. Their replacement by modern chains is only partial. The share of hotel groups, despite the shrinking market, is growing. The development of franchising leads to an increase in the number of facilities and rooms in chains at the expense of independent hotels. We can congratulate ourselves on such a significant improvement of products, thanks to raising standards, but there is a strong need for new investments to avoid a deficit in the main tourist markets."

It lacks the basic functionality I had hoped for, i.e. a gentle wake-up call with light. There is no function of pretending to be present (even though OSRAM says it is). There is no documentation for the software. The lamp allows limited colour changes, generally only cold / warm light. I gave 2 stars only because it can improve the software, why the product deserves 1."
1602,"She added that these epilepsy can be very effectively treated and do not leave any defects in the form of cognitive impairment in children. Children simply grow up with them. Prof . Steinborn pointed out that the treatment of epilepsy is generally dependent on what kind of seizures accompany it and with what frequency they occur. There are epilepsy which does not require any treatment at all because seizures are extremely rare - they occur once or twice in a lifetime. But in some cases epilepsy is associated with dozens of seizures per day, and this significantly increases the risk of mental impairment of the child and worsens its prognosis. ""The more frequent the seizures, the higher the risk of disability,"" said the epileptologist."
1603,"I have to divide my assessment of the treatment of Mr. Arkadiusz's crooked nasal septum into two categories. The effectiveness of the treatment is assessed as 5 / 5, here I can not have any objections. However, the comfort of the treatment itself is an exclamation point. The operation took place in C . M . Sanitas in Lublin . I have to admit that lying down on the operating table on my own, without any sedatives, is not a pleasant experience, and even more so a recurring consciousness during the operation, at the end of which I felt clear pain. I had no idea at the time that I was being operated on, and the voices I heard were the conversations of the operating team. The very fact that I was leaving the anaesthesia was also very unpleasant, and I tried to wake up by very bluntly speaking commands to which I was not able to react. It was a very unpleasant feeling, I had no idea what was happening to me and why someone was putting pressure on me to finally wake up when I couldn't even nod, say a word or make contact in any other way. The pain after waking up was very clear, when it started to get worse after the second ketone drip, I didn't get any more painkillers even though I was being asked for them. The ""how it hurts, i.e. that he is alive"" was said with a smile on the nurse's lips, who later also exerted pressure to leave the bed more quickly at the end of his stay, even though he didn't feel like he was still able to get home a few hours after surgery. When I was finally expelled, the pain intensified to such an extent that all night long I walked around the house and groaned 'em, which probably made me vomit for a while. For 2 weeks I felt terrible, I had no strength for anything, most of the time lying in bed with a high temperature. After the surgery I was still at Mr. Arkady's, several times, on pulling out the setons, 2x on removing stitches and pulling out the ""plates"" which hurt as if someone tried to pull out the ones at the top. The ""anaesthesiologist did not want to give you any more anaesthetics, so that waking up would take less time"" was really pathetic. A few days ago I was operated on at WIM in Warsaw because of acromegaly and I must admit that the tuitaj treatment is pure pleasure compared to your surgery. Unfortunately, but it will not recommend you to anyone, despite the experience that you cannot refuse. Nevertheless, I greet you and wish you to draw conclusions from my opinion."
1604,"Dears , Contact reception good , Ask for room 216 . Bathroom is spacious for hotel conditions. I know it's hard for us to get along because we have different strollers and different needs. For active strollers the seat attached to the wall may be a little too high. Good for me. Mirror and washbasin too high. You can see yourself in the front mirror. Room - safe, minibar available. I was taken by a wardrobe - hangers on the right level! ! ! Mattress too high. But I guess it's probably a problem for most hotels. We are looking for an interior designer on an active wheelchair ! ! ! ! Maybe the manager will invite a friendly stroller and choose the height of the mattress.

1607,"We went on holiday in early August with Vizier, who assured us that this is a very good hotel praised by tourists. We arrived at 2 a.m. and we got a room with two bunk beds (it was to be a family room). For the first time since the 20th wedding anniversary she slept with my husband on separate beds. . . She had the impression that I was in a dorm and not in a family-friendly place. Additionally, the air-conditioning didn't work and in this room there was still a door to the adjoining room where the English were noisy, so at 5 wakes up! In the morning they asked us to change the room and we got a room with a double bed and an extra bed (for a 12-year-old child). Everything was slow, because at the reception desk they just have time. . . The joy was enormous, the child lay down on the bed that had folded. . . Fearing a long time for his replacement, my husband took the matter into his own hands and fixed it himself. She forgot to add that there was a big ""mushroom"" in the bathroom on the ceiling - moisture. . . The food was good, although monothematic. Nice service at the pool bar. Animation without madness . Mini club with leftovers of crayons with nice Polish woman Taida ."
1608,"A month ago, I had my first visit to this doctor. She got me there ""on my own. "" She just wanted me to check my condition prophylactically and do a cytology all the more so as we're trying to get a baby with my husband. I must objectively say that I was satisfied with the examination. The doctor talked to me a lot, about my health. He dispelled my fears or ""suggested"" what might result from it. What to worry about and what is normal. In fact, in his style of being cool, he may seem cool, but I don't care much for someone to entertain me during such a doctor's visit. I guess she'd even feel uncomfortable or she couldn't quite trust what she says if this kind of doctor was sweet or very nice. What surprised me very positively? A breast examination done by a doctor. He himself took the initiative and even treated it as a standard and further gynaecological examination. He surprised me because NEVER any other gynaecologist even offered it to me - including those doctors who have been canceled for a visit more than Dr. Elias. A week ago I had a positive pregnancy test. I'm going to see a doctor this week. I hope to be satisfied this time. Greetings to ."

Instead of a wardrobe - a hole in the wall killed with 2 green boards - I couldn't even put my clothes there for the whole stay! ! Neither the hotel staff, nor the resident, reacted to the request to change - neither the room, nor the hotel, nor even an earlier return! ! I have pictures that differ from those on offer! ! ! The possibility of paying a surcharge for the view of the ""garden"" is embarrassing, especially since it is a view of dry soil and rubbish - seriously!

Once he conducted an unexpected action of the question, but my group was sitting in the Tavern at the time: he fired more than half the people from what I heard and saved the rest because ""somebody is"
1611,"I do NOT recommend or advise against visiting this doctor. I agree with my previous opinions. He ignores and disregards what the patient is reporting to him. During my visit, instead of talking about the reason for my visit, the doctor told me nonsense about his impressions from M . G . Then at the end he came back to my problem, stating in general terms that I eat incorrectly. I wasn't commissioned with any research, just advice to eat less. I'll just add that I eat little for reasons of gastric inconvenience, as mentioned by M at the beginning of the visit. I have not been given any factual advice, only a prescription for 150 PLN. For someone who, according to the doctor, it is not a bit strange that I have to buy such medicines. Another doctor advised me not to buy this prescription."

1614,"I have no idea who is giving a positive opinion of this hotel. Advertising photos were taken a long time ago in the times of its glory that are long gone! I agree with the opinion that this hotel is primarily badly run. In the corridors it is just dirty, pieces of ceiling on the floor, dirty water in the pool, not cleaned cloakrooms in the pool, no garbage was taken out of the room (we took it out ourselves). In the room as well as in the bathroom, the wall and the ceiling (ventilation is not working). The only positive memory is nice weather and really clean lake. The hotel should be taken over by somebody else and put in order because the center has a huge potential but every object should be renovated. For the time being, I strongly advise against vacationing in this hotel."
1615,"We just got back. Moloch, the entrance and the hall as at the railway station, I don't know what people are smoking there, the cheesy decoration that probably remembers the golden times when the hotel was built, but I'm sure the Russians like it, because there are actually more Russians than Poles, besides, attention with small children - draughts, draughts, draughts. . . Parking outside 20 / day, kitchen - COSMAR! ! in the heart of mazur tilapia, panga and other arrangements, mass massacre, the only plus Tropicana, although also already to be renovated, everything completes a long way from the center of the village.

With a large drive, of course, they start distorting. But there is one thing that disqualifies this equipment for me. Tweeters in satellites are dummies - a simple form cast in plastic and not connected to anything. It can not be called a fraud, because the manufacturer does not mention the two-way satellites anywhere, but still - such a procedure causes a big disgust, and thanks to that the satellites play enough . . . . .flat.

Towels were changed daily and cosmetics were supplemented. There is a possibility to use the Internet, without entering a password or code. The undoubted advantages were the meals served: breakfasts with a Swedish buffet - cold and hot, very tasty and unusual dinners, you could say that even sophisticated, dinners as well as breakfasts with a Swedish buffet. And for all of this, the waiters' service is incredibly nice and professional. The conference rooms are comfortable, professionally equipped (apart from the main screen, current side screens) and well sounded. The hotel has a small swimming pool, which you can go to in a bathrobe, which is included in the room equipment.

1619,"Hopeless doctor, the child treats during the examination instrumentally what led my son to cry and fear of the examination (he himself states that this should be the case; the child and the mother are supposed to cry!!!). He created that my son has a stole and wandering testicles, which of course was an incorrect diagnosis, in the stress of the testicles can go back. He hurt my son, while pulling the foreskin, he made him crack and thus now he has adhesions and inflammation. My son suffered because of this Lord and we still have to be treated. Mr. Galewski pulls off the foreskin by hand with an infant - it is a method of treatment from twenty years ago, which is now no longer used and is first treated conservatively with medicines (it is the opinion of another doctor who knows this Lord from such actions). This gentleman should not work as a pediatrician. The purpose of this opinion is to warn mothers of boys not to allow Mr. Galewski to examine the intimate surroundings of their children."

The worst part is that we've missed a better hotel for the worse. . . ...and you can see it. . . .and we were in Karpacz for almost the same money. . .

The year 2012 for the second time - neurological ward - pressure, dizziness - diagnosis - meningitis. However, she was not alone with me, my dear doctor Barbara Wach was with me. Now I know that this is not a judgment. I know how to treat myself and live, and I am not afraid anymore. She got me medical and spiritual support. Warm words of support, a good heartfelt smile and those never forgotten words ""You'll be fine."" And you'll be fine. THANK YOU DOCTOR PATIENT MARIA POLINSKA"

The doctor was bored, he did not explain what he saw on the screen, lack of any diagnostics, the questioned person answered our questions with a bored tone. In addition to the basic lack of diagnostic skills, he also showed a lack of personal culture, turning to the pacients on ""YOU"". At the end he ostentatiously gave me a huge roll of paper to wipe my belly without even looking at my side. So far the pregnancy has been carried out in a state hospital and I have not encountered there such ignorance and shoulder of professionalism. I strongly advise against it! ! !"
1625,"She had the impression that the doctor was controlling the visit time. She asked me a lot of questions where the doctor's answers were ""I don't know"". ""It's hard to say."" .

The only difference is the view from the window. Fantastic breakfasts, despite the winter, lots of salads and vegetables. The service is very courteous although you can see a lack of training. Of course it's the beginning, the hotel is brand-new, but an honest assessment requires this attention. You can see a good idea, the architect and interior decorator must be appreciated. Now only the landlord must provide customer service. And we hope that you will not regret it and here the means will certainly pay off. The hotel borders on the Restaurant Marina, where you can pamper the palate: - ) . There is a SPA in the hotel, which is managed by an excellent and very professional Ms. Anna.

After a few visits she had had enough of me and told me that I would not come to her anymore. I am ashamed of the fact that she did this to me. Only at home did she realize that the doctor was right and that I need help because I can't deal with my problems by myself. She came back to her, and she was happy to accept me. It's getting better and better from visiting me. I get along with people, I can fight anxiety, irritation and sadness. Thank you doctor for ""second chance."""

I agree with the opinions about stretching to unnecessary tests, and even suspect that he may have falsified test results. Isn't it interesting that all patients of Dr Lewandowski have at least an erosion that can be frozen? !"
1630,"She would never recommend this doctor to me. During the visit she practically didn't find out anything because she had a feeling that the doctor would bite me. She felt guilty that she came to me. What others write in their opinions above is the most sincere truth and also my feeling. She shouldn't work with people or even leave home in such a state. This is the first time I've met such a terrible doctor. In my clinic she takes two other dermatologists and it is them that I attend, this lady in my life would not come back."
1632,"I don't really know where to start. Maybe so; who doesn't like scandalously dirty windows and curtains, broken walls, dirty night tables, cigarette stench, very uncomfortable beds, repulsive bedspreads, broken access card lock forcing the guest to be stuck each time for a few minutes at the door, then he should definitely bypass the hotel with a wide arch. If you like to have tea for breakfast, you can't do it at 7 o'clock. The bored staff set the boiling water just at this time. It heats up ok . 30 minutes . My review is not malicious or claiming. I'm an outrageous customer who has come across a company that is not aware of what a fair play attitude towards the customer is. P . s Very polite and professional swimming pool and spa service."

A small swimming pool with dirty water. yeah. prices are disastrous, breakfast (scrambled eggs with 1 egg = 25 zloty) downstairs have a club where they do not play music because: ( quotes the bartender ) we have guests in the mountain. A great profession to sum up: the only thing they did well was a good advertisement, well distinguished in bark leaflets and nothing else. It is better to rent a room in a house than in this holiday home. No Wi-Fi. You can only rent a network cable at the reception. I advise against it. Friends who have been here before said that it is not worth going here. I join their opinion ."

Introduce yourself if you are not afraid of lynching from the other (many thousands) parents. It's easy to slander without a name. I agree with the previous speaker. There's only one man who could write. A wonderful woman, a very good doctor, treats all children as her own and takes care of them. She devotes her private life to the health of our children.

Professor Morita was brought to Poland by the Ewa Błaszczyk Foundation "" Akogo ? "" The stimulators for patients were provided free of charge by their producer - Boston Scientific Poland. Surgery consists in opening the spinal canal and then inserting an electrode over the spinal cord hard tyre. To this electrode current flows from the stimulator, which is placed on the patients trunk. The current from the pacemaker through the electrode is to effectively irritate the brainstem structure. The stimulator is connected to the electrode by a wire running under the skin."
1636,"The doctor has a very annoying habit of looking at the clock from time to time, which makes you feel bored or impatient. It's not a nice feeling, for example, when you tell her about the traumatic experiences of your life, she shed tears, and she looks at what time it is. Besides, she is quite dry. I don't expect a tender attitude towards the Patient, but maybe more kind, especially when it comes to paid visits. I did not like her comments about my appearance either. You can point something out in a different way and - for God's sake - not during every visit. I think that she motivated me too little to change, but she cut the wings of many of my ideas. She was relieved to end my therapy with her. Ufff !"
1637,"The doctor during her visit to the night-time medical aid was superficial, very unpleasant and arrogant. I understand Saturday evening, when she came to the hospital, the doctor and the lady from the registration office drunk a cup of coffee and gossip. there was no call for patients, and had to wait 15 minutes behind him moved and received me. When she entered my office she decided that it was not necessary for me to come (and she had a terribly dry cough through which she could not breathe, fever, and clogged sinuses) She barely examined me and prescribed medication and that's it. She didn't even say what was wrong with me. I wouldn't recommend this Doctor, wgl doesn't count on the welfare of her patients."
1638,"Mrs. Dr. Radomska is a very good doctor who knows his way around. Believe me, I have a comparison, because with my ""revelations"" I have jumped many gynaecologists from Wroclaw. At the beginning I was really a little scared because Dr. Radomska has a ""dangerous"" expression on her face, but she behaved really courteous and professional, answered questions, dispelled my doubts, was delicate, ordered all necessary examinations. She left me very satisfied. And for those who complain that the doctor is ""unpleasant"", I advise you to think about whether you are looking for a professional doctor who knows his stuff, or a very nice, radiant, choppy doctor who will not know much about gynaecology and will not be able to help his patients. Unfortunately, ladies, but to talk, or smile, you can go to a colleague, to the LEKARZ we go to fly, and not to joke or chatter."
1639,"I'll write the truth. The hostel is located on the 1st floor. It consists of two apartments opposite. I fell in the part in the ""apartment"" on the right, in a room not too often seen by the cleaners. The equipment located in the room: a double bed (placed under the window with blinds) . On both sides of the bed there are two stools with bedside lamps. Under the wall opposite the bed there was even a wardrobe which could be easily moved because it was on wheels. Next to the wardrobe there was a chest of drawers on which you could put a woman's bag (there was no room for more equipment). There was also a hanger. Screwed to the wall for screws . I advise you to take thick slippers with you because there is nothing on the parquet floor, so now it's time for dessert: There was a mattress on the bed covered with a sheet in black, on which there were some grey stains. There was also a quilt, but the thickness of the cardboard (for my intervention the staff added some blanket). There were also two pillows, not much thicker than the duvet. Tired of traveling, he tried to get some sleep, but he couldn't get it, because in the apartment upstairs there was some dog running around barking happily every now and then. After he was calmed down from behind the wall (i.e. from the room next door), the sounds of a loving couple started to come. Bathroom: a shower with hot water is tolerable, but the toilet calls for vengeance. Dirty and in need of sterilization. The only advantage was very strong WiFi. Don't forget to take cash with you too, because you can dream of paying by card. The price included breakfast. Forgot to add that if you buy something and do something for yourself it will be. But you could make yourself a coffee and tea without any problems. I personally was there last time. This hostel taught me one thing: don't believe the hostels that I'll avoid from now on."

Shower facing the wall without the possibility of changing the setting, towels once changed once not, the same with a baby bed but that was not a problem. Scandalous breakfasts, inka coffee on an island famous for its coffee and scrambled eggs with powder alternating with fried. The swimming pool is open like up to 21 but the jacuzzi closes at 18 because the pool master goes home and invites guests. . . I recommend thinking about other hotels to relax in a relaxed atmosphere."

And so it was in this situation: the waiter went to the apartment, knocked three times at appropriate intervals, introduced himself behind the door. He did not receive any reaction, so he decided to go in and leave the set with the greeting card, while finding the tenants with sex. There was no information on the door not to be disturbed."

1646,"He defended his master's thesis in chemistry in 1965 at the California Institute of Technology. Then, as a Fulbright scholar, he spent a year at the Institut de Biologie Physico - Chimique in Paris. In 1970 he received his doctorate in biophysics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As part of his postdoctoral studies, he conducted genetic research at the University of Edinburgh ( Scotland ) for three years. He himself judged that it was a wonderful time, both from a personal and professional point of view. In 1974 he joined the staff of Brandeis University in Waltham (Massachusetts), with which he is still associated today. At this university, Rosbash began to carry out genetic research on the mechanisms of the biological clock, i.e. the perimeter rhythms, in living organisms. In 1984, together with this year's second Nobel Prize winner - a colleague and friend Jeff Hall - they cloned the gene that controls the biological clock of the Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly. They named it period ( in short per ) . Daily changes in protein levels, which encodes the gene, regulate the rhythm of activity and sleep of flies in the period approx. 24 hours."
1647,"Maybe for which one of you is a charlatan, as for me so far (35th week of pregnancy) is fine, think about it, really women of 21 - all ages are really Europeanized, you used to not wear trousers, you ate mostly meat with hard hunting. As for his treatment methods according to some people, I owe it to him that I am pregnant."
1648,"When I got pregnant, I was looking for a gynaecologist who I could trust 100% at such a special time as pregnancy. She found me, by chance, Mr. Jaworowski. The doctor gives the patient a sense of security, a sense that all examinations and pregnancy are conducted in a professional manner. He answers all the questions in detail, without ignoring any doubts. The doctor can be called at any time, there are no problems with long term ""bumping"", as is the case with some doctors. This gives you a great deal of comfort and the feeling that the care is not just about a monthly visit and prescribing tests. In addition to professionalism, there is one more thing - so important after all - a cordial, empathic approach to patients. Dr. Jaworowski led my pregnancy from the beginning to the very solution - a caesarean section, which I also remember very well. In the hospital I did not feel left alone, Mr. Jaworowski looked at it and remembered. Doctor, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your care at such an important time for me and my husband, thank you for bringing our daughter to the world safely, for every good word, smile and advice, greetings!"
1649,"A nightmare. Cold in the rooms, cold water in the shower, a mushroom in the bathroom, unsavory meals, thin walls so that she heard the neighbor snoring's snoring, the smell of musty in the lower part of the building probably due to lack of ventilation. The whole hotel in a very low standard. Kitsch . No hardened access road. In addition, unprofessional staff who discuss private matters with guests. And something else that no one has written before: after one night in this hotel, I have some itchy redness in one place on my skin and I am not allergic."
1650,"I recommend the hotel in Janów Podlaski to everyone. We have already been here a few times in a group of friends. Full professionalism: reception desk, room service, cosmetics in SPA. The big advantage is that the hotel is located on a large area (40 ha). The owner took care of walking places, children's park, tennis court. There is a bicycle rental. There are water aerobics classes at the pool. Water in the thermal pool. There is a jacuzzi and several saunas. The rooms are tastefully furnished. The advantage is that the rooms have fridges and tea and coffee making facilities. It is worthwhile to watch this hotel because you can relax here or arrange a family meeting, birthday party, business meeting or even a wedding or wedding reception. I used to use the room in the castle area. She also saw the family apartments in the bailey, which have 3 rooms with their own bathrooms and a kitchenette with a building. It is a great solution for families with children. Greetings to the owner and his professional crew! !"
1651,"Mr. Sir, the dearest private practice apparently turned his head because years ago, when he started his career in a public institution on Pabianicka Street, he was able to heal and treat, and behave himself. Unfortunately, I had the unpleasantness to meet him again in this clinic, when she reported to me as a matter of urgency, because of sclera and uveitis. Anyone who even has an ophthalmologist's knowledge of ophthalmology knows that these conditions can lead to permanent damage to the eyesight. Mr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Haynes had my requests in his nose, explaining the lack of space. Then she asked me to confirm my refusal in writing so that she could go to SOR. The doctor got on his nerves, he started to scream out that I wanted to intimidate him, send me back to the manager and so on. If it hadn't been for the fact that I was admitted to the SOR, where I received the right treatment, so that I could still see well, she would have referred me to the NFZ. Maybe this one would remind you what it is like to work within the fund. Maybe in private, Mr. Dr. Trojan is just a couple of times to please the patients, but for me it's not an argument and I don't recommend this person to anyone."
1652,"The luxurious hotel in the Prudential high-rise building at Powstańców Warszawy Square was supposed to welcome the first guests before Euro 2012, according to the announcements of investors - Holding Liwa company. If this happened, it would probably be the first large luxury hotel in the capital. Unfortunately, works on the reconstruction of the building and adaptation for the hotel faded in 2011. The official reason for this were the problems connected with conducting works on the building simultaneously with the construction of the second underground line. There were also discrepancies between the architects from ""Bulanda , Mucha Architekci"" office and the investor. The project envisaged a return to pre-war architecture, leaving some socialist realist details, but the authors feared that the investor would change the assumptions without agreeing with them and the building would become a hybrid combining art deco style with socialist realism."
1653,"The biggest advantage of the hotel is its location, tasty cuisine and of course the staff. . . The facility is also equipped with a small swimming pool, which is not standard in this part of Europe for mountain class hotels (above 1000 m above sea level). . . . .so that no one would suspect me of being too picky about it, I'll be brief. . . the facility would benefit from a solid renovation and replacement of equipment in the rooms. . . . .and one more important piece of advice for autumn and winter travelers. . . . . . .the rooms can be cold. . . . . .just such a regional display of hospitality. . ."
1654,"I was sent to your doctor in September with a delayed period of 2 weeks and after two pregnancy tests with positive results. The doctor said that this does not have to mean pregnancy at all, and then she reluctantly announced that she would do an ultrasound. She put me on the couch and the doctor shouted that she is going to perform a vaginal examination and I have to take off my clothes. Now I know that, but then the way of performing the examination was not obvious to me what the doctor could not understand. During the examination the doctor complained all the time that she can hardly see the screen because the sun is shining. After the examination she told me that ""something is"" but she does not guarantee that a pregnancy will develop from it. I understand that at such an early stage of the pregnancy one should never get too much hope but the way the doctor did it left a lot to be desired and I after the visit I was broken down and for the next visit to another doctor she was already thinking I was only thinking about the fact that she probably had a miscarriage. During the whole visit the doctor didn't look at me once and at the beginning she asked me if I was paying for the visit, then she seemed unhappy with the presence of the ""subscription"" patient, who didn't leave any cash alive. The doctor did not show up at her place anymore. Now I'm in 33 tc . and I can't imagine that my pregnancy could be led by such a dry person . Luckily, she found me a doctor who, in addition to professionalism, is characterized by humanity."
1655,I strongly recommend this hotel. The location is ideal - Warszawskie Powiśle from where you can quickly get to the city centre. Price is very reasonable for this location. The rooms are clean and tidy and the hotel staff is very nice! She didn't use breakfast so I won't say a word: )
1656,"The room on the bay side is probably best located in the hotel. The staff are polite and kind, although the waiters' staff have had some accidents. The kitchen, in my opinion, is weak, many dishes without taste, not spiced, although nicely served. Small car park you have to be careful when parking. Cleaning the room, well... . . . .could be better. No good coffee, and coffee cups too small for ""big"" coffee. The bar had a beer liqueur, but there was no beer from the barrel only bottled, in a small selection."
1657,"I don't recommend it. We spent 10 days in the hotel in September, I don't recommend it to anyone. Apartment = which we received after a long argument with the owner should be closed, all old, dirty, soggy, mushroom in the bathroom, no ventilation, no hot water in the morning (allegedly must be warmed up) kitchen utensils and plastic and insistent dishes. I'm not picky, after all for such money but it's already a bastard that we let ourselves be screwed in like this, sold by the office of Rainbow Tours, one star for cleaning, every day the maid cleaned this thing. By the pool, a small bar, used to serve the bar staff to spend time with a noisy Greek family. They drank, bathed in the pool, and screamed all day long. If you want to relax by the pool, unfortunately it will not work. And a miracle, the owner who is doing us a great favor by selling us her rooms, at the end accusing us of stealing the white-goose towels that they left us by the pool. Embarrassing, what they have us for! ! !"
1658,"She was in this hotel in April 2007. It was quite empty and quiet. You could say that little was going on. She had the impression that there were literally a few people passing by. The hotel was quite clean. Medium meals. The evening animations somehow escaped my attention, or they just weren't there at all. The water in the pools was cold. The closed bay seemed a little cloudy. For those who appreciate peace, silence and blissful laziness."
1659,"During the three-day stay on the feast of the three kings the royal package we bought was as follows: cold water where at the reception desk they said that they have not adapted the stove for such a number of people, small rooms, but the balcony was mega spacious for the length of the foot where we were not informed about such a balcony, no music channel, kettles in the rooms and no tea coffee where for 4 stars is a failure. In the royal package for billiards you had to pay 20 zl when she asked me to include music in the billiard room she heard m that music is on its own. . . . . .the dirty table has nowhere to sit, no words. . . . . . .the average food is barren and monotonous. . . .the only thing I liked about this hotel was the service of foreigners in the restaurant. . . The gentlemen were very kind. . . Bye-bye, she heard m that I have to pay a climatic fee and all this in a royal package."
1660,"A juicer bought a few days ago and I can't get out of my mind - the equipment is brilliant, it looks beautiful in the kitchen, very nice and precisely made and, what's most important, it makes delicious juices! Wnoski from observation : - power appropriate (we were wondering about buying a stronger version of the J500 - there is no need! ) - juices are squeezed very quickly both from soft and hard fruits and vegetables (tested carrot, apple, pear, orange, kiwi, banana), - dry pulp, perfectly squeezed (from hard fruits and vegetables), - appropriate size container for the pulp allows to grind up to 5kg at one time, - large hole for inserting the fruit definitely improves squeezing (no need to cut into smaller pieces beforehand), - volume as it is when squeezing, I was surprised that it goes quieter than expected em, makes a little noise when hitting hard pieces (eg . The only surprise in minus was the amount of juice squeezed out of the bananas - it comes out really minimal amount and it is not worth squeezing out but it is probably not the fault of the equipment but the specifics of these fruits to sum up: the equipment is not cheap but 100 % worth the price, although the latter could of course be a bit lower ;)"
1662,"As Dr. Kozajda emphasizes, genetic background and environmental exposure to chemical agents, including mainly exhaust fumes and other pollutants in the indoor and outdoor air, have a significant impact on the occurrence of allergies. These pollutants also include factors of biological origin, including animals and house dust mites, and their allergens, as well as the moisture and fungus in the apartments due to improper use of the houses. The Lodz IMP conducted tests in 50 flats of one- and two-year-old children in Lodz. The researchers examined dust settled from the floor of the living and children's rooms and from children's cots, taken from mattresses and bedding. Dust samples were collected using a vacuum cleaner with a special head equipped with a filter, on which the dust was deposited."
1663,"We were at the Manor Hotel in 2010 at the turn of July / August. It was very difficult to reach it by a dirt road (yes, dirt!), but the location (by the lake) can compensate for this. The lady at the reception greeted us oschle, that not to mention smile and started looking for our name from the reservation. My husband found it faster than you so he told her the number of the room on the list, to which you answered in an outrageous tone: ""I think I know better! "" . The first red light. The room was okay, except for the wallpaper coming off the wall and the lack of bags in the trash bins. Breakfast, however, unfortunately, did not surprise us - dirty (no, it was not crumbs from previous guests), tablecloths in the dining room, service staff absolute lack, the food was reported very rarely and not much. Another surprise was waiting for us after returning to the room (about 11:00 a.m.) - not working card to the room. As it turned out after the conversation with the lady from the reception desk, 'I thought that you've already recovered, so she blocked my card'. The bowling alley in the hotel and the location unfortunately will not make up for it. No , no , and again no . I don't know where these stars come from, because the hotel absolutely does not deserve them. I don't recommend it."
1664,"FOR FOUR YEARS, MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A CHILD. AND DURING THOSE FOUR YEARS, A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR LIVES. THERE WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS (WHEN IT TURNED OUT THAT I WAS PREGNANT) AND THERE WERE BITTER TEARS (WHEN SHE MISCARRIED THE FIRST PREGNANCY, THEN THE SECOND.) BUT WE STILL STICK TOGETHER AND STILL HAVE NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP. WE BLANKET OURSELVES STRONGLY AND WANT THE FRUIT OF OUR LOVE TO BE A CHILD. NOT SO LONG AGO, ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO, WE HAD ENOUGH. BUT THANKS TO DOCTOR ZIĘTKOWIAK, OUR LIVES HAVE SUDDENLY CHANGED. WE HAVE SO MUCH ENTHUSIASM TO FULFILL OUR DREAM, SO MUCH FAITH AND STRENGTH THAT SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE MOVING MOUNTAINS. THIS IS A MAN WHO WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING SO THOROUGHLY THAT EVEN SOMEONE WHO KNOWS NOTHING AT ALL WILL UNDERSTAND IT. AND HE HAS THE ANGELIC PATIENCE TO DO SO. AND THIS IS A FEATURE THAT VERY FEW MEN HAVE. I REALLY RECOMMEND HIM. I'VE ALREADY VISITED A LOT OF DOCTORS AND I ASSURE YOU THAT DOCTOR ZIĘTKOWIAK WILL BE COMING TO THOSE WITH A VOCATION."
1665,"For years, scientists have been looking for a therapist who could stop or delay polyglutamine diseases. Such illnesses are ok. In Poland, Huntington's syndrome occurs on average in one in 15 thousand people. But the genetic core of polyglutamine diseases is the same for all. Therefore, the development of a therapist who recognizes the same mutation could help a large group of patients. ""The DNA consists of 4 letters - C , A , G , T . The core of the disease is an elongated sequence of three letters CAG within the damaged genes. Repetitions in the DNA chain occur naturally. For the huntingtin gene there are usually less than ok . 35 . With a mutation of this gene in Huntington's disease, the number of repetitions can reach as many as 150 sequences of the trinucleotide CAG sequence"" - explains Anna Stroynowska - Czerwińska ."
1666,"The doctor did not detect very advanced endometriosis in me (several visits). During / and after the examination he does not explain but you have to ask yourself, draw conclusions and ask again. Besides, the visit is in a nice atmosphere and if someone has no problems, it is ok."
1667,"I would categorically advise against it, I have left a lot of money in the clinic of this gentleman. He did a laparoscopy on me without checking the permeability of the fallopian tubes. He didn't tell me much about the disease I have, only the next doctor enlightened me. The doctor didn't say much, you have to ask about everything, I don't remember very well the period of visits to Mr. Dr. Dywijuk. . . She would not recommend me to anyone. . ."
1668,"The only positive thing about this is that you can actually make a phone call. Nokia phones are not intuitively operated anymore. There are a lot of completely unnecessary applications which require a network connection to open. I think you can give them up. The battery does not hold more than 5 days standby. Camera without flash . The display has not lasted a week . Apparently, it was mechanically damaged . I don't know anything about it. In any case, the camera has lost its warranty and the LCD replacement is an additional 200 PLN . I do not recommend ."
1669,"Mr. Bartholomew listened to the long history of my injury and asked questions about important details, so he pays attention to the course of the disease before the visit without making a diagnosis based solely on observation. Once he had gone through the observation, he conducted it meticulously, examining all the movement ranges of the affected leg and precisely locating the pain focus, and then confirmed his suspicion with ultrasound. During the visit, he was nice and made contact with me, making me feel good. This, combined with a low price, gives the image of an excellent doctor, I strongly recommend a visit to Mr. Bartholomew and greet him warmly."
1670,"I don't know how the complaint will end up. After receiving the shipment, I checked the product, while milling the hard products, the lid started to rise on the right side and stopped the squeezer as hard shredded parts got under the auger. The seller received a message from the seller that she should not be cutting vegetables. The hole is small so there is no chance she wouldn't cut, although she put the carrots in the m not cut and the same thing happened. The third week I wait for a decision from the service. Because the seller said that now only service, because the goods were opened. No words . Additional shipping costs, and how will spr . end up and when I do not know ."
1671,"I don't recommend it. Very cramped rooms. The room device also leaves a lot to be desired. Breakfast can be. A minus for lack of orange juice, and in return water with syrup. No elevator. We were planning to stay 2 days, but we resigned earlier. Every Saturday, a disco. Music can be heard in all rooms. At this price you can surely find something much better. He wouldn't call it a hotel. . . The only plus is service and free wifi."
1672,"I'm a dozen or so months after the operation on my lumbar disc. Nowadays I have no major problems, although sometimes I feel moderate pain, especially if I sit a lot and have a seated mode of operation. I went to the physiotherapist because I wanted to return to systematic strengthening and preventive exercises. Zygmunt recommended me to another valued physiotherapist as a specialist in stabilization exercises. First, Zygmunt made a very detailed interview and got acquainted with the medical documentation. He gave himself time to prepare an action plan, which he then discussed in detail. Additionally, he explained to me the essence of my ailment and the way of working on it. He implemented the exercises gradually, as far as I was able and the progress was made. This gives me a sense of security and full control over what we do. Of course, the effectiveness of the therapy is very much up to me, i.e. the more I exercise, the better. Zygmunt tries to mobilize for systematic exercises. He likes to talk and always patiently explains the issues of anatomy, functioning of our body and specificity of ailments. Moreover, there is always good telephone contact with him. In conclusion, I strongly recommend Zygmunt as a professional and effective physiotherapist."
1674,"All inclusive is total bottom. Only beer, wine, rakija, brandy, ouzo. Unfortunately, the only normal alcohol, i.e. rakija, was a scarce commodity, it appeared and disappeared. Waiters did not give more drinks than 1 / wasps . We were two families with children so there was a huge problem for two people to take drinks also for the rest of the company. The bartenders lied that they did not have alcohol, they saw us pouring water to other guests, embarrassing matter. I have no exorbitant requirements, but what we saw in Crete Palm. . . . . .no wonder this country has economic problems. With this mentality of these people, I'm surprised myself that I've been there (in Greece) a second time. At lunchtime it was normal for the waitresses to come to us after 30 minutes or they had to ostentatiously ask for drinks. To the beach it was about 100 m across the street, it is known that a man took some drinks / drinks / beer because he paid for it. . . . but the staff thought otherwise, they pointed out that you can not carry anything from the hotel there because people who have bars there complain. . . . ...embarrassment. I sincerely advise against it, for that money I guess two or three stars better anywhere else."
1675,"The Hotel Azurro is located in a very good location, close to the beach and the centre, less than an hour by the beach to Nessebar. We had breakfast and dinner, but if there is a possibility to take board without breakfast, I recommend it because it was difficult to choose something for breakfast, most of the stuff just not tasty, sometimes not even fresh. Dinners were already better, they often changed the dishes and most of them were ok. The room was pretty nice, all rooms have balconies. Every day cleaning, they had us during one week three times changed towels. The bathroom had a large shower, the only thing missing in the room was a dryer. The wi - fi network at the reception desk. Except for breakfasts, I have nothing to complain about, quite nice and in a great place. But if you expect luxuries at a low price, I do not recommend it."
1676,"There wasn't the slightest problem with passing the course - everyone succeeded. Easy questions, really just the basics. The lecture is unfortunately a bit chaotic, half an hour dr. spends on reminding us of what was a week ago, sometimes it will turn around. If someone is expecting a novelty, he will be severely disappointed - Dr. Szczygieł talks with sentiment about measles 1300, claims that a mouse connects to the COM port (and does not react to students' remarks that such mice are almost nonexistent;)) and the lecture is mostly devoted to old age;)."
1677,"The room is spacious, but the bathroom is small. The door to the bathroom does not close. The faucets in the remote control for air conditioning are exhausted, replaced after our intervention. The TV set works, but there is no antenna, so it does not receive any program. The first cleaning took place on the 5th day of our stay and probably only because they asked us at the reception desk for toilet paper. Towels were changed after 10 days and repeated requests. . . . .for smaller ones. The bed linen was not changed for 2 weeks. Kitchen is hopeless, actually you can only eat vegetables and feta for 2 weeks without any harm to health. At night, sleep is interrupted by drunken guests from Russia. The only plus - location near Rethymnon ."
1678,"Its main shareholders are Emirates Investments Group , Majid Al Futtaim Group and Abraaj Capital. The company operates in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia and Australia. ArmaniW Dubai, in the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa has been operating for two years at the Armani Hotel, the second largest hotel in the world after Milan with a fashion designer's label. Emaar Hospitality Group LCC, part of the Dubai-based Emaar Properties development group, has a port folio of hotels, residences, but also golf clubs and polo games, marinas - obviously exclusively luxury."
1679,"THIS DOUBLE ALBUM IS A SCANDAL! ! ! It contains as many as 42 tracks, but - not knowing why - mainly from the period when the band was crawling, it had many vocalists (known but still often clumsy) and has not yet shaped its characteristic sound. The real NC is the years 1967 - 76, when Ada and Wojtek were the only soloists. From this period there are no such flagship hits as : Don't knock on my door, It could have been different, Hey smart water, Once I met it, Apologies to the waltz, Came to me blues, You and me and night, Be you girlfriend to me, On concrete flowers don't grow, Andrea Doria, Flight to Venus, Naga, Dance free island and some others."
1680,"The visit to your doctor (in a private subscription clinic!) lasted. . . 8 minutes ! Despite an empty waiting room. The doctor asked me what I was coming with. She said that with hypertension, accelerated heart rate, chest pain. He asked if I was taking any medication for this, she answered that I was not at the moment, but I had taken it before. He didn't even ask what kind. She told me about family cardiac problems. No reaction. When asked if she was chronically ill, she answered m that yes and to what. No questions about the ailments and the drugs she was taking. Oh, there was a question if I smoke cigarettes (no); but about my lifestyle, alcohol etc ... no more. The doctor examined my blood pressure (he didn't even give me a value), listened to my heart for a dozen or so seconds ( ! ) and then found that I had hypertension and tachycardia. Here she shyly mentioned that on the last two ekg (at the occupational doctor, who noticed a big problem and even questioned my ability to work! and the family doctor) there were irregularities. The doctor even looked at me and did not ask what kind of abnormalities. Without asking about other medications taken, allergies to medications, after listening to the heart and examining the blood pressure (the same is done by the family doctor) etc. He wrote down a prescription for one medicine and had it come next month. He was very happy to give a referral to the ekg to do it immediately before the next visit. No interest, no diagnosis, no research. I went to your doctor encouraged by good opinions, hoping that since I have already broken down and I want to start treating the ailment that I have been struggling with for a few years (which she said to me), I will be able to count on the diagnosis (after all, I pay this subscription for something and it is the highest) and serious approach to the subject. It turned out that my family doctor is more careful with it. I do not recommend."
1681,"She is very nice, student friendly, cheerful, with a great sense of humor, she teaches very well, she doesn't like it only when someone doesn't try and expects a grade""."
1682,"Dr. Jaskolski was my dentist for over four years. However, after my last visit I decided to change my specialist . Initially, I was delighted with the professionalism, approach to the patient and the prices were reasonable. Since Dr. Jaskólski hired an assistant the prices went up very much, the atmosphere broke down and I am starting to have doubts about the quality. The whole thing is that this is a doctor who is supposed to cure my teeth and not entertain me with conversation so I won't complain about the atmosphere. Prices initially with anesthesia were in the range of 100 - 150 zł, from the moment the assistant was hired, she never came down m below 150 zł and recently took a risk m and took the treatment without anesthesia and paid m 170 zł, a little bit more so as the hole was reportedly not large and on one surface. To the doctor is very long waiting time because at least 2 months, very rarely you enter on time (I do not mean here 5 or 10 minutes because it is normal but sometimes the delay occurs even to an hour). I am a person who rather cares about the teeth, so my surprise was huge when, after the treatment at Dr. Jaskólski's, I went to the orthodontist to put on the braces and she heard that first I have to cure the caries. To correct this, it was mainly secondary caries under the fillings from the years of my youth, but as a professional, which Dr. Jaskólski considered me to be, I should pay attention to and deal with this problem. I would like to mention that she did not believe my opinion and went to two other dentists to verify the condition of my dentition. Unfortunately, both confirmed the need to replace 6 - 8 fillings (the discrepancy in the number is due to the poor quality of panoramic pictures that all doctors had to see (by the way, I advise against taking pictures in Fordon on Fiedler - very nice lady but poor pictures). ) The caries were visible ""with the naked eye"" in 5 cases and the others when looking at the picture, the dentists said that they suspected that the tooth was broken but were not 100% sure. I understand that the prices are going up, I understand that the patient is not a colleague to talk to, I understand that there may be a delay, that the specialist is waiting but noticing the caries, I do not understand and do not accept."
1683,"Unfortunately, I have to give an average opinion because I am not satisfied with your doctor's commitment and I am changing doctor at this point. My aunt sister recommended me to Mr. Paul because she went to see him herself. She dared me to go at the beginning everything was as it should be the examination, ordering appropriate tests and at the very end the diagnosis and start of treatment. I find that the treatment was wrong because she felt better before taking the drugs than after. And the second thing is that the doctor with each subsequent visit did not examine me but gave me a prescription for which she paid 150zl. I have sick ovaries and I am interested in what is going on there. I can not recommend I am disappointed. She thought I would have a good doctor on the spot and in the meantime I have to go to Warsaw to see another doctor."
1684,"An express visit that lacked a thorough medical history. The doctor prescribed a medicine with an ingredient to which I am allergic, without asking if I have any allergies. She had the impression that what I had to say about my ailments was of little importance to her. A very quick visit - which does not work to the benefit of the opinion I can give about this doctor."
1686,"The drama of deception and nothing else. Money thrown into the mud the ball with a dj wasn't a dj ball wasn't a ski slope wasn't there, the disco wasn't there is nothing but cheating. Paid a pile of cash and nothing else drama laughs in the hall"
1687,"She visited my pool and restaurant. The standard of the hotel is very disappointing, the surroundings also. Many things are damaged or underdone - paths, toilets, swimming pool changing rooms, rather 2 * not 4 *. The dishes in the restaurant are tasty, but one of them is completely salted. The chef has tried to rescue, but clumsy. I do not recommend."
1688,"There were two of 'em in the Park Villa. First time in business - with the organization of training . The second time with the family . There is parking, there are decent rooms, there is a nice place downstairs for breakfast. There's a place for barbecue in the garden. And what is the most important - there is excellent service."
1689,"I recommend her as the first of many doctors to detect the cause of recurrent inflammation, have a smear, write down the antibiotic and for a year I feel like a newborn (her diagnosis was in 10). Besides, the doctor is very nice, explains everything calmly and does not rip off the money from the patients (when she came to me with the results for the second visit, for the visit, examination and prescription of the medicine she paid only 20 PLN). I recommend it!"
1690,"It is definitely a hotel very below the 5 * standard. The rooms are neglected, the sewage system is inexpensive, you can smell septic tanks all the time in the bathroom and you cannot use the shower and sink at the same time because it knocks out. They reported us this, but were unable to repair it. The whole complex often smells of cesspools. . . . The food is very poor quality, we have had stomach problems, even vegetables and fruits are far below the standard you can get in any restaurant. We practically constantly dined outside the hotel. We have been dining all inclusive for the Poles, there is still a half board offer, the food they give in another restaurant, probably better, because the guests from Poland with all inclusive there do not let in! What you can save on the plus is a good location, quite quietly, close to the ferry on Amouliani, good internet, TV with two Polish programs and good beer from the barrel available in all inclusive offer. Generally I do not recommend."
1691,"Hotel at a very high level. The location is ideal for exploring the Wieliczka Salt Mine as well as for a trip to Cracow, given that a modern railway line can be reached in a few minutes by getting on the train practically from the hotel. The facility itself offers a wide range of services, with the constant concern to improve them. Random and rather rare imperfections are immediately compensated for with additional options. The sound insulation of the hotel guarantees a peaceful sleep. Optimal interior design. The contact with the owner - an open, beautiful, positive and intelligent woman - is excellent. A place worth recommending . Attention, from experience I know that already at this moment, due to the influx of guests, it is necessary to make a reservation in advance. I will certainly return personally."
1692,"85% of products consumed in developed countries are processed products containing too much sugar, fat and salt . They contribute to a dramatic increase in the number of obese people, which has doubled worldwide over the last twenty years. ""Since there is so much talk about diets, healthy lifestyles, many of us are trying to comply with restrictive calorie regimes. We have a lot of low-fat products on the market. However, it turns out that when we subtract fat from them, this creamy texture that it provides disappears. A good example is full-fat yoghurt, which has a characteristic taste and texture. However, its version with less fat and calories is much less popular, among other things because it is watery and does not taste the same,"" says PAP Dr Izabela Gładkowska-Balewicz from the University of Leicester and the University of Birmingham."

1694,"As I read these positive reviews, I think I was 'em in another hotel. Although there is also a lot of criticism in these reviews as opposed to others and especially those popular search engines where the reviews are very positive. Yes, the staff is nice. Entering the hotel and immediately not very pleasant kitchen smell. . Then to the room after the destroyed stairs and not very clean carpet (it may be such a climate) . We enter the room and there is a real PRL. Unpleasantly dark, dirty sconces on lamps, cleanliness I find tragic. Bedding to white has far away. Very worn out. Mine was torn. . My wife was all right. . . Clothes recess - hangers to choose from. . The most common type is laundry room aluminum and many other types. . . Towels - tragedy . . . Worn out and the quality of their washing leaves much to be desired. Dirty and funny shower . No dryer . . No washing liquid . . Liquid soap with dirty cap on the washbasin . . Not to mention a bottle of drinking water. . . Of course not. . . For this price, it's really a mistake. He paid 'em for two days and left 'em after the first night. . He even looked for some positives but he didn't find 'em. Maybe we found a room like this because when he read 'em that was a general overhaul in 2005, I think they forgot about it."
1695,"For the first time I meet with a doctor who gives the patient an offer of paid laser therapy without any discussion about the possibilities of free treatment and how to eliminate the ailments within the NFZ. Additionally, detecting the problem, he does not offer the patient a cytological examination. According to Dr. Dźwigały, the ailment which was eligible for laser removal after consultation with another doctor turned out to be a small ailment which could be removed free of charge."
1696,"I was on a visit with Dr. Wincewicz for the first time, the visit was on a high level, the doctor devoted a lot of time to me, I had no sense of impatience, which is cool and gives comfort. I came out of the office with the feeling that you can help me, that the doctor will take into account my other diseases, I am an oncological patient and gynecological problems to the effect of the treatment so far. I am 36 years old, still hoping for health, for being a woman. Talking to the doctor, examining him, offering to help him, offering to help him, gives me hope for a return to normal. This is the doctor I will return to for help. Thank you Agatha Reason"
1697,"R . M . : Genetic recombination in bacteria . If the bacteria take their genes from the environment, new strains, new varieties are created . The most interesting question is where these new genes come from and where this diversity comes from. This is part of the project that I will be carrying out. The hypothesis is that they come from closely related bacteria, good bacteria that do not harm us. This hypothesis raises many questions. Because it turns out that you can't separate the good from the bad bacteria, there is no black and white in nature, in microbiology and medicine. So how to cure and fight the bacteria that cause diseases if they can exchange genes with good bacteria? What is a species of bacteria, if they often exchange genes and new species are created? These are questions on the borderline between evolutionary biology and medicine that are not yet answered. Magdalena Richter spoke to me."
1698,"The fairy notoriously escapes to the ceiling: (, and flies as she pleases, the effect is that she bumped into the wardrobe and broke the wing, and the daughter got it in her nose and flew blood.

1699,"Unfortunately, she was disappointed with the visit she had been waiting for 4 months. I paid 150 zloty (when I registered at Wyszynski's, it was impossible to speed up the visit) and when I came someone literally ""pushed"" me into line. Despair. As for the visit itself: the doctor looked at me carefully and my results, ordered an additional paid morphology and lupus anticoagulant and probably for which I paid extra (about 80 zl) At the visit I did not know anything, no path and direction to solve the problem - she said that she will consult and let me know - but I have never heard about it again. For me, waiting for a doctor for 4 months with constantly changing symptoms and paying for every little thing is impossible to swallow and it shows that it is not about a person but about money."

1701,"The specialist pointed out that the main electrolyte lost with sweat is sodium, however, its concentration can vary greatly among athletes and can range from 200 to over 2000 mg/l. ""Therefore, some people should use drinks with an increased sodium content, unfortunately most mineral waters provide it in negligible quantities, which is why drinks for athletes often come in handy,"" he explained. Prof . Edward Franek from the Department of Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Diabetology of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Hospital in Warsaw argued that when it comes to daily fluid replenishment - it is best to drink water.

In total, these facilities offered accommodation, i.e. 3.39% more than in July 2011. The number of establishments offering accommodation in the first half of 2012 is based on the information presented by the Central Statistical Office ""Accommodation base as of 31 July and its use in the first half of 2012"" .

The attention of prof . that I no longer have the strength to walk, I can't get enough to a tram stop. Every day I have dizziness, nausea, vision disorders, imbalance, walking, speech, I cannot cook my daughter's dinner, go shopping, go to the cinema, I have a headache all day long, and so on. Sometimes I am not able to pronounce a particular word, the letters disappear in the spoken words as I say - you do not hear them in the word or at all. In the RM on July 20, 2015 a venous angioma was found in the left cerebellum hemisphere, vascular lesions, in addition, from September 2014 I am treated for hypertension, glaucoma from 2014 February.

Mr . prof . denied my data from the Internet, informing that Łódź is ranked 8th after stroke treatment, but the 2015 data were not taken into account. I, on the other hand, looking at the state of my deteriorating health and since 30 July 2015, several times it was necessary to intervene in medical rescue services and diagnoses and treatment in the emergency rooms, I am afraid for my health. I have a strict mind I can't give up looking at the worsening results of the tests and at the same time worsening health before waiting for the next tests. I am not able to work in accounting, nor to return to scientific work. Currently, I am on a rehabilitation service, increasingly ill and waiting for effective treatment and I wonder when I will recover. Asking the question whether I will be healthy, the professor did not answer. During the conversation in the doctor's office he was kind, smiling, during the tests he was understanding that no tests are not nice. Edyta Janaszkiewicz from Łódź ."
1704,"...we were at the professor's last week. First, 2 hours late, sitting with a few months old child for 2 hours in the waiting room ended up catching some kind of virus, earlier the visit was also cancelled (we were waiting for the visit about 1 or 5 months). She did not notice any special approach to the child, the whole visit lasted maybe 5 minutes, we were accused of information about possible problems of the child and a heap of tests that have to be done privately - no explanation of what and for what, we came out scared. We will not go again."
1705,"The hotel is located just a few minutes by subway to the center and all its attractions, but also easy to reach by foot: ) The service is nice and helpful, not all staff speak English. The rooms are well equipped, the kitchenette is also at a high level. Clean, nice, rooms well muted from the outside, but guests from the room next door can be heard: ) Internet goes fast and smooth, Breakfast is quite monotonous without hot snacks, but it all becomes unimportant when we get freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast! The pleasure of taste! I highly recommend the hotel and Barcelona itself ! He wanted me to come back here !"
1707,"Very professional, concrete and empathic doctor. Already at the first visit we were informed in a comprehensive manner about the course of treatment. Everything took place according to the information provided by your doctor ☺. Thanks to the appropriate approach to the patient my son during the visits was cheerful and completely calm. Post-operative care is great. We are very pleased with the fact that we have just arrived to your doctor Honkisz. I wish myself and everyone who will be forced to take advantage of medical care that we always find such doctors as Mr. Ireneusz Honkisz. Thank you very much? ? ? ?"
1708,"I definitely do not recommend this "" hotel "" . Big cockroaches in the hotel and other vermin . The owners are very silent, even repulsive. This is the first time we have met such an unpleasant and repulsive family. The owners were nice only to those who used their buffet daily. The apartments look completely different than in the pictures. I really don't know where this hotel gets good reviews from. I think they write them themselves. Overall, the island is wonderful and the Greeks (except for those in the Iris Hotel) wonderful."
1709,"I bought 'em an Easter stay through Cuppon. On the spot, after dinner, I wanted 'em to have a cup of tea (I had my own) because I had to take my medicine - . Unfortunately, the water dispensers standing on the floors did not heat it, despite this possibility. At the reception desk they answered that ""probably spoiled"". So he asked them for hot water. And here's my surprise. They found out that the owner of the hotel, Mr. Gniecki, had forbidden the hotel staff! ! ! I can buy tea (price 5 zloty), but I can't get hot water unless I pay 3 zloty for it. There is no such item (hot water) in the price list. I must admit that nowhere in Poland - and I have been to different hotels because of the constant professional trips - I have never met with a similar situation. In the hotel, except for the receptionist and a calner, there was no one from the managerial staff so that I could report my grievances, and the phone call to the owner did not get 'em (the boss forbade). I get the impression that the guest is in this hotel in last place. I'm writing a hot review, still from the hotel. Edward D ."
1710,"Doctor's kind and kind. He explained everything calmly, especially since the patient was 86 years old. He did everything in no hurry and wondered about the problem. She thought she would need surgery, but the doctor convinced me that you can solve the problem with drugs and not necessarily with heavy steroids. I am happy with the visit. Check in 2 months. I hope everything will be ok. If not, I won't be discouraged either, because you usually have to start with a treatment that can help but is not too radical. I'll give 5 stars if I'll be equally happy after the next visit."
1711,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! I very much regret these few visits, because not only was the tooth untreated, but the matter was worsened instead of being improved a bit. The doctor was frugal in her words, she had to ask me about everything herself, because she practically didn't say anything from herself, what really happens to my tooth, and it was an uninteresting condition, because it required a thorough and long-term treatment. The doctor started root canal treatment. After a month's break, the whole medication/dressing fell out. My tooth hurt. In my opinion, such a long break between visits to the root canal treatment is simply unacceptable. After a month, when she saw a hole in my tooth, she spoke for herself. So I went to another dentist. It turned out that in one canal, which the doctor described as ""tight"", a piece of surgical instrument or cement, which the doctor used, was stuck. In addition to this, there was a lack of suitable equipment in the dentist's office to perform the procedure such as canal cleaning, which would indicate how far the needle is in the canal in order not to damage the tissues. While taking the X-ray, I was ordered to hold the plate which she had in her mouth with her own hand. And she came m "" from the street "" so, wanting not to, before she got to the doctor's office, she must have touched some handles and doors. She didn't get me any disposable glove. Unprofessional, no commitment, unclear. I'm sure I won't go there anymore and I wouldn't advise everyone because it's money in the mud in my opinion."
1712,"I am very pleased with the visit. It was my first visit to the gynecologist and I admit that I was quite stressed out. However, the doctor makes a very good first impression, she is nice, polite and smiling. The office itself is very nice and clean, which immediately calms down. The doctor is very factual and carries out research efficiently, which in my opinion is a plus, because there is a lot to discuss here.) In no way did she feel evaluated, and I admit that this is what I was afraid of. I think she was well informed about everything that she should know. In conclusion, I highly recommend ."
1713,"From the doorstep in the hotel room there were unpleasant surprises waiting - the room was quite big but the bed was situated in a completely non-functional way so that you enter it straight from the front door. In addition, there was no table on one side of the bed, only holes left to prove its previous presence. Lovely view from the window to the car park exit. But the cherry on the cake turned out to be the bathroom. Apart from the mould in the shower cabin (although it is difficult to call the cabin a piece of floor separated by a curtain) and the nightmarish, chemical (something like vinegar) smell of towels turned out that there is no radiator in it! I assure you that in Polish climate conditions, bathing in a bathroom without heating in November is not a pleasant experience. The charm of bitterness was passed by a light switch placed directly in the headrest of the bed - 3 times during the night woke up m after accidentally turning on the light. The only advantage for me is the location - close to the old town ."
1714,"I spent 1 week of July 2015 in this hotel. The hotel is for the less demanding people and families with children. You have to start by evaluating the hotel service, which is fatal in most people. Definitely favour regular customers of course Russian women. The food is good, but it is repetitive. The rooms are not bad. The cleaners are terrible, they have a grudge against people for being a mess in the room. ."
1715,"The hotel is located slightly below the center of Karpacz and the Kolorowa slope. Access with GPS is easy, next to the hotel there is a large closed car park (paid). We will sleep in a spacious double room (suite). For a family with a child it is an ideal solution - in one room there is a double bed and an extra bed, in the other there are armchairs and a bench; in addition, there are two LCD TVs (good offer of TV), two tea kettles, a lot of wardrobes, a refrigerator. From what we have observed, the equipment of ordinary rooms does not, however, stand at an equally high level (e.g. CRT TV); as for a hotel with a resort profile, ordinary rooms are also relatively small. Despite the late hours of the bar party, the room was quiet and peaceful. Good free WiFi. The service, especially at the reception, was nice and helpful, although the waiting time for check-in is about an hour. 23 (half an hour with a sleeping child) was unacceptably long. The weaker side of the hotel was the food - breakfasts were different from hotels in the Mercure chain, especially abroad, and the food refill was also definitely not good. The hotel restaurant was not used by us. The offer of additional entertainment includes table tennis (but requires its own rackets), billiards, cymbage. However, the equipment is strongly tarnished (e.g. broken rackets left on the table tennis table did not encourage the use of fun). Outside the playground for children . The swimming pool is small, clean, although the walls would also be useful for renovation (flooding patches), rather to play than swim. A separate paddling pool for smaller children and a lot of water equipment is a good thing. No lifeguard in the pool. Water and air temperature OK; it is possible to go to the pool without going outside, which has advantages especially in winter; bath towels were reported to the room on request. In general, the hotel allows you to have a good weekend's rest, especially in the spacious room used by the ushers. However, the standard leaves to wish; especially at a price of over 500 PLN. ( weekend ) per day you can expect more. Generally the rating is between three and four ""stars"". The apartment was finally four, but only for a suite and above-standard helpful receptionist."
1716,"It will increase the range of activities and above all the number of guests. Make your existing customers convince them to use your services, so that they also use the services provided by your hotel. Example "" Recommend our hotel to a person who has not yet had the opportunity to use our accommodation and collect one of the services during your stay, such as: back relaxing massage or two-course dinner as proposed by the chef "" Your regular guest can not only recommend a nice place to stay to a friend (since he is here himself, is the best proof for a friend that the facility meets his expectations). but also to have the double benefit of this - to please a friend (as part of his stay he gets free service from the hotel) and himself."
1717,"The hotel is quite big, divided into two parts A and B. We were here for the weekend Hallowenn with attractions for both children and adults. Super animation for the kids, the kids were delighted with the activities and various games. The pool with a paddling pool and slides for the little ones, Jacuzzi, a large slide with a tube - fun for everyone. The food was very tasty, a large selection of juices, drinks, whatever you prefer. I think you couldn't get over what you paid for. As for the rooms, it's the only small mini-size, for their size, for a 4-person family where there was an extra bed for the children is a very small room (we lived in building B, I don't know what they looked like in A). Generally a super hotel, friendly, nice service, clean and tidy. I highly recommend! ! !"
1718,"It has something beautiful in it, but only when it's developed. Often people do not like it, or vice versa, they fall in love with it from the first smell. I personally like it 80 % - why? It just seems too heavy at first, not for me. . . only after a while it smells like it should. So I don't give him the maximum number of stars because I think there are smells with a nicer whole note. And the price is also not the lightest, so I prefer to spend my money on another smell. I'll add that it's a very durable smell! : )"
1719,"We came after the holidays based on positive opinions and disappointment. The rooms are tiny ( ground floor ) but clean and nice . I think it's freshly renovated. There were no bathrobes for us, so we were left without. We didn't get the money either. For the second day, the professional room service lady brought us everything we asked for. A spa with modern equipment, but the ladies don't explain too much what they're going to do, how much time, etc. Bubble bath without paying extra money, even though it's included in the offer. But it is worth to use the treatments because they are cheap and properly performed. Pool . . . Hm, m . . . It's different from the pictures, and there are people from the outside. Oh, the pool is not open all day. 15 - 21 and on Saturdays and Sundays additionally 8 - 11 . There's a lifeguard. Saunas in a separate room . The showers at the sauna are broken and there is only cold water. The sauna itself ok but forget about the oils. And this unfortunate restaurant. Breakfast: scrambled eggs, steamers, ketchup, mustard, horseradish. Hard eggs, cottage cheese, yellow cheese wedding some roast. Yam, flakes, milk, honey, butter, bread: bulbs, dark and light bread, croissants. Pineapple, cake with caster sugar. Tea, coffee, juice. Tomato , cucumber . The biggest problem is that if you end up with something, you have to wait a long time for it to come down or even to dough. No waiter's question about coffee, etc. . Dinner's even worse. With the hotel fully occupied, the problem with tables. The staff can't handle the cleaning of the tables and the food. There is a chronic lack of plates. The raw materials didn't tell us how it ended today. After asking the waitress if there's going to be raw material, she rudely said she'd ask, but probably not because it's over. She didn't report even though it was an hour. 18 and the restaurant is serving dinners from 17 to 19. To choose: 2 soups, potato chips, pasta with sauce. 2 soups, chicken fillet, fish. 2 juices and 1 kind of cakes. No extras such as olives, cold snacks, salads, etc . Non stop eating is over so when you put on fish you don't have chips. If you catch the potatoes and raw potatoes you will miss the fish and so in a colic. The gym, the equipment is cluttered and the orbit doesn't work, so it's not really there. The rooms are very warm, the corridors are cooler but not cold. The climate is good but I was expecting more castle in the castle. They don't give the climate of the castle inside. Generally I do not recommend"
1720,"The hotel, in my opinion, is good, close to the beach but has no sun beds. Nearly a stop for the train to Barcelona, 10 euros both ways. The hotel is clean and tidy, cleaned daily. The food is delicious, large selection, fresh and good. Cook who cooks on a regular basis, nice service. Every day some themed evenings unfortunately we had the opportunity to be on only one: flamenco show. I really liked it. Besides, the pool, rather small with a view of the sea. Some animations in the form of games, zumba, aqua gym. The hotel has gyms but we did not use them. There is also a Jacuzzi, but it is also paid extra. The view from the balcony to another hotel, as in all rooms. The overall impression is very good and I would rather recommend this hotel: )"
1721,"Before she arrived she was looking at the hotel's website and everything looked great. Upon arrival she got a room on level 1 where it was cool. On the first morning she experienced a little stress because there was no hot water. The reception staff after my phone call said it never happens. Apparently they had to turn something up because after 10 minutes there was hot water. There is a kettle in the room, tea to prepare. I wish she'd found my coffee. It's more like this place she'd expect me to be. Besides breakfasts, other meals were hopeless."
1722,"The visit was flawless, but also without results. She reported to the office with spinal pain radiating to the lower parts of the body. Mr. Matusz interviewed me, unfortunately, she had the impression that he didn't take my words into account, because he didn't massage the places she spoke about for a long time. It was only at the end of the visit, after many times paying attention to the strong pain, that he started to massage specific places. After leaving the office for about 30 - 40 minutes she felt a slight relief and the pain came back. The next day I had to go to a specialist again (another day) because the pain kept me awake at night and this time I managed to do it at once, the pain disappeared."
1723,"In 2012 we were frequent guests in this hotel. Beautiful (super-decorated), bright, clean restaurant with excellent service. Breakfast is delicious and very varied. Very well arranged Swedish table. Room standard I do not recommend - small and hopeless bathroom. Rooms in another part of the building are not very comfortable, you have to walk to them through a very long corridor (over 150m?) overlooking the parking lot. In the winter months in this part very cold ! I recommend comfort rooms in the main building. Everywhere clean and aesthetic. The reception staff is courteous and nice except for Mr. Dominika and two other ladies. These people can not take care of the guest properly if you have to look for a reservation by HRS - completely incompetent. They received guests for 1 hour after the trip standing up (elderly people) because there was a mess in the reservation list instead of inviting them to the table and suggest for example something to drink. It was the clients who asked them to call HRS and check it carefully."
1724,"I'm working on it. Soon we'll be inviting our guests to something completely new, which is also not found anywhere else. I think there is a demand for it, and the Chamber is a great place for it. We're working with Konrad Gaca and we're going to be conducting weight loss support tours. It will not be what others already have, that is, weight-loss holidays, but teaching people a natural diet that supports weight loss - this is the idea we call ""My New Self"" . You said that Kombornia Manor is part of the broadly understood offer of the Podkarpackie Province. So let's move from Kombornia as one of the elements of the tourist offer to tourism as such ."
1725,"I've already been to several psychologists. . . . . .and unfortunately, I have a very negative opinion of these ""specialists"". . . Since then, I have only been assisted by psychiatrists, with whom I am better able to talk to, and secondly, I get concrete help from them in the form of medicines. Years later, she decided to try it again and I got to Mr. Przemysław Turkowski. . . and surprisingly, she surprised me very nicely! He turned out to be a very competent and wise man . For the first time I had the impression that I am talking to a specialist who knows what he is doing. This is what she expected from a psychologist. Thank you"
1726,"I do not recommend the Krasicki Hotel despite its interesting architecture. During the whole stay about every 3 minutes in the room you could hear a strong gust of ventilation (noise comes from outside the building, you can hear it both with the window closed and open). The noise is unbearable, especially at night. As for the * * * * * hotel such noise is unacceptable. We have reported a problem at the reception desk and we have heard that the hotel is aware of this problem and that it is a big problem for the hotel. An even greater pain for the guests. . . The sound of ventilation ( ? ) (? ) ( a steady loud buzzing with breaks of several minutes ) can also be heard at the reception desk and after leaving it ( outside the building ) . I don't know if we have just had a breakdown, or if it is a constant problem of this building. Besides, in our room (IVp) there was a very small window, which means that during the day, the light must be on. Personally I prefer clear, bright rooms. The size of the windows is due to the architecture of the building. Therefore I do not recommend this hotel to people who intend to stay in the room a lot during the day and like natural light. Breakfast is served until 11:00 a.m., at 10:45 a.m. the food has already started to be cleaned even though it was still in the restaurant and the time of 11:00 a.m. has not passed. I have not encountered such behavior in other hotels of similar standard."
1727,"I've been your patient for some time. and I have the following thoughts: - the price for the visit is high - the initial wish to answer all the questions about the treatment - now every question is a troublesome difficult question, etc. - the bdb office is equipped to answer any questions if someone has any experience in the treatment of your doctor. ? I only sincerely hope that the costs incurred during the treatment are adequate to the skills of Mr . L . S ."
1728,She was at the hotel in the off-season and season. Stay before the season wonderful ! Parking almost all for me . Restaurant almost all for me (on dinners / breakfasts occupied about 10 tables. . . . .and the buffet generally serves the same as in season) . Silence . . . . . . . . . .the view of the lake. . . . . ...and comfortable. Maybe I don't really like the decor. But all the rest of the off-season is in the strong five.) ) ) )
1729,"From ""Welcome"" to ""Good Bye"", there wasn't even the slightest element that I could get attached to. Excellent accommodation, excellent room service and all services ""on the phone"" including the kitchen practically 24 hours. Activity and hospitality - this is where Polish ""HOTELARS"" should go and see how the guest service looks like on vacation. Bravo Papillon Zeugma - you can spend even 3 weeks in such a place."
1730,"More than 5,000 cellular nuclei have been studied and the locations of both tracked genes in relation to the nucleus centres and the nuclear envelope have been determined. For one of the observed genes (BDNF), a change in position of several hundred nanometres (billionths of a meter) was observed, with the gene in control animals occurring near or on the areola or in the middle of the cellular nuclei, while for animals after an epilepsy attack the value fell to about . 25 %. ""The twofold decrease is a very big change in biology. We also found that it remains visible even for several weeks. The conclusion is therefore unequivocal: neurons also remember what happened thanks to changes in the architecture of their cell nuclei"" - says prof . Wilczyński ."
1731,"Sorry, but I strongly advise against buying. After three years of moderate operation for not very demanding work, mainly carpentry, spilled in the hand of the reduction ring of the disc (some kind of casting of shaysmetal), and that it is quite rare reduction (25, 4 / 16, 4mm thick) so it remained looking for a lathe. To make matters worse, when the need for more precise work appeared, it turned out that the right and left side of the guide bar are not in line and it is not possible to determine the angle of cut once, but you have to correct it with an angle bar depending on the id of which side of the guide bar will be used. For the sake of completeness I will add that the sewis spreads out the hands: for older types we do not get parts."
1732,"The hotel is divided into the so-called old and new part. We, unfortunately, have found ourselves in the old part, which certainly has nothing to do with the positive opinions appearing here. The room - solidly bitten by the tooth of time, at the entrance repulsive smell of musty. Cracked tiles on the floor, scratched walls, falling out contacts. ATTENTION to hairdryers - in our room the hairdryer was so clogged that after switching on it practically started burning in hands! A tiny shower, a shower curtain with mould, taps covered with a thick layer of stone, there was also an additional tenant in the form. . . cockroach . The towels were not changed even once for the whole week! Cleaning was limited to throwing away the garbage from the bin. As for food, it is very monotonous. For breakfast, day in, day out, something like mortadella plus a serotype product and cereal with milk. We also liked bread and coffee the most. Dinners completely without expression, no spices. Plus for the fact that there was no shortage of food for anyone. The swimming pool was small, mainly controlled by the kids, but the beach was close by - it was enough to go to the other side of the road. Nearby shops, right next to the hotel, car rental, and a bus stop nearby. To sum up - if you go to Gortyna, then as far as possible from the ""old"" part of the hotel."
1734,"A few words about Airbnb if you don't know the service yet. This is a booking platform dedicated to renting your own apartments. Currently, there are also other types of accommodation facilities, not only apartments. There is a strong discussion about Airbnb in many countries because it is treated as unfair competition in the hospitality market because initially the services were not taxed. And in many places it is still not. But let's get back to the research. It turned out that positive opinions dominate overwhelmingly among reviews and ratings of Airbnb facilities. The 600,000 properties surveyed had ratings of 4, 5, or higher. On a 5-point scale. Comparing these results with e.g. TripAdvisor, the average for nearly 500,000 properties (most hotels) analyzed was 3, 8. Also in the 5-step scale."
1735,"A very nice and friendly doctor will answer every question you ask. I am very pleased with the consultation on my varicose veins, finally I found a good specialist whom I feel I can trust :) I don't give a good mark just because she didn't have the surgery done and I don't know what the results will be, but I feel like I will be satisfied: )"
1736,"I think that she is well prepared for marketing, she can entertain the little patient and charm the parents, so it's no wonder that the waiting room is full of parents. But. . . . .first of all, I don't think that blaming the parent for the fact that his child is ill is appropriate, secondly, the attribution of a ton of medicines, including permanent steroids to the nose, I don't judge as a beneficial solution for health without understanding the reasons why the little one is ill, thirdly, bronchial diseases or ear infections are, however, diseases of childhood age and the Doctor's assessment that the little one is too small for such a disease is completely inconsistent with the assessment of paediatricians. Generally nice, but not convincingly and not for such money."
1737,Fungus mixed with dirt. The photos show black corners. Shower and bathrooms looked as if nobody was cleaning in them . Not after previous guests but for a long time . Falling handles . The staff didn't react at all to the reports . Toi - Toi in the marina in Mikołajki looked better.
1738,"Head of the Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Prevention of the Oncology Centre in Warsaw, prof . Witold Zatoński tells the Polish Press Agency that in the 1960s he was a member of the Polish Oncology Centre. In the 1960s cigarette smoking was common in Western countries. In the USA and Great Britain as many as 80% of adults smoked cigarettes. Even every second American doctor smoked . A report from half a century ago was the result of research from the 1950s . The report from half a century ago was the result of research from the 1950s, which showed that cigarette smokers were more likely to develop cancer. In 1954 this was confirmed by the American Society of Oncology, but then hardly anyone believed in it. The statements of the country's chief physician Leroy Burney, who in the late 1950s announced that nicotinism leads to lung cancer, also went unnoticed. The tobacco industry then claimed that filter cigarettes were completely safe."
1739,"""There are still many myths about vitamin D, such as that taking supplements increases the risk of kidney stones and can damage the kidneys. Meanwhile, the recommended doses are certainly not a risk factor for kidney damage, and chronic kidney disease is even an indication for supplementation with this vitamin"" - noted Dr Płudowski . He reminded that a whole range of preparations with vitamin D is available on the market. Two of them are on prescription because they have undergone clinical trials. ""I represent the position that we can use non-prescription supplements (cost more than prescription - PAP) provided that they have been manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP). The most important thing is to take them every day, in the right dose"" - concluded the expert."
1740,"I'm sorry to say that your visit to the Doctor didn't bring anything. The prescribed medicines and herbs have had absolutely no effect, not much of it, since the beginning of this year I have been suffering from a constant cold - at first an infection of the upper airways, now the throat. The Doctor has been on the site for the whole visit (less than an hour - exactly 45 minutes - even though it is written on the site that the first one will last at least 1 or 5 hours. . . ) collected an interview, after which she got a mixture of herbs. Despite several months of improvement she did not see m . Apparently I'm a man of little faith, but I don't recommend this expensive treatment, it's a waste of time and money."
1741,"Hello, I have been going to Dr. Kuschill Joanna regularly for several years. Once I look better and once worse, I am generally an old lady who wants to keep the remains of young and beautiful looking skin. During these few years I have had various treatments such as Scuptra, botox systematically, mesotherapy especially for the hands, fillers, radio waves, laser fraxel. I am grateful to the doctor for her patience and perseverance because she rightly noticed that I am a little over-sensitive and always find something to improve with me. The ground is a good feeling and I have it as soon as the visit to Dr. Joasi is coming. Thank you and hello"
1742,"She decided to book this hotel because of the possibility to use the hotel's Spa. From the reception desk she received an email - and that I was assigned an entrance at 7pm on the day of arrival. After going down to the wellness area at the appointed time, it turned out that the staff only starts the individual thermal facilities at this time. Therefore, due to too low a temperature, I could not use dry and steam baths and heated beds. The wellness area itself is small but well equipped. The room that I occupied was clean and comfortable. The hotel is very well located near the main attractions of Segovia."
1743,"I had this robot from October 2013 until today. After 3 complaints I got the money today. It's okay. I may be loud at work, but it's cool, I can handle it. But it's all based on plastic parts. I used to sit on juicers. Besides, why do I need a juicer, for which you have to turn everything around and divide it into chats about 5 cm? But back to the house. . . . .with 2 carrots, the juicer stopped working because a plastic motor was being made. Repair 2 3 weeks. And again the same. Replacement with a new juicer and again the same. 3 times they tried to give me a new robot. I preferred the cooker, because in the end it is still plastic components. That's too bad. . . . . .I'm looking for something more solid."
1744,"Encouraged by the photo of the burger on Booking's website, I was tempted by this hotel. Driving from Warsaw, some kind of massacre to get there, you have to convert. . . . .no linden. Reservations made by phone, the lady who accepted reservations has a problem with writing, and the lady who accepted the guest (me) has a big problem with reading. . . . . .accepting the guest lasted half an hour, of which the search in the notes 25min . . . bookings made on a4 cards. Normally until me and another guest helped us look for you after the reservations. Like in some movie from the communist era The price of a room encourages you to take advantage of the benefits in the restaurant. Room price about 100zl . In the restaurant I wasn't disappointed only with alcohol. From the dishes he tested em grilled chicken breast and beef burger . Burger is a terrible linden... they put some leaves inside (supposedly it's a rocket) but this leaf is so hard from a plucked one you can't chew, some stalk hard in this leaf no massacre Grilled chicken breast small but this dish is so easy with no need to fuck up here, both dan serve fries but they are of poor quality - hard linden again The whole hotel has such an aura of a roadside motel I will not come back either for the night or for food"
1745,"The unusual nature of these molecules has been proven by recent studies . They have shown that with the appropriate microRNA molecules an adult cell can be reprogrammed into . . . .stem cell . It was already known that stem cells can be obtained by introducing a set of three genes into an adult cell. ""Now it turned out that it is enough to increase the expression of the appropriate microRNAs and the cell will ""retreat"" to the stem cell phase. There is no longer any need to interfere with its genome, just ""add"" the appropriate microRNAs and you are done! We were grabbed by the head when we found out about this research! "" says the scientist. Dr. Bielawska-Pohl points out that intensive research on microRNAs is being conducted in laboratories all over the world, because there are still many question marks. ""We are constantly looking for the possibility of using these microRNAs to treat many different diseases, learning about the mechanisms of their regulation and action"" - points out the researcher."
1746,"He used 'em for a few days and returned 'em. The main reason for the return is the poor quality of the video recorder at night . In my Opel Zafira diesel car there are vibrations on the windshield (handle issue ?) and the picture is blurred at night and additionally dark. It does not work properly gps - once it works, once it loses its reach even in the center of Katowice, there is a poor quality handle for fastening and unfastening the webcam, I had difficulties with unfastening. The option to turn off the keystroke illumination did not work, when this option was turned off, the keys were still illuminated. Overall, I am not satisfied with this model."
1747,"The building resembles the late 1990s. Outside and inside, the equipment is disastrous. Several rooms have been renovated (replacement of tiles, painting the walls partly only, 2 stinking chairs have been inserted (they are made of the unknown origin of the ecosounder, which emits a terrible smell). - the clothes that were lying on the washing chair . Walking on the carpet of the nose, you have dirty feet - the carpet is so worn out, it stinks. On the wardrobe 1cm of dust, in the wardrobe 3 hangers. In the room narrow windows wide. ok . 50cm (only 2 open the rest locked, not to be opened). The blinds are broken, smashing. Tilting table . In the room the dishes - dirty, dusty - no problem! The small room has nowhere to step. Kitchen - massacre ( !) For breakfast every day eggs under different forms, cold cuts (poultry, pseudo Cracovian, salsa and raw sausage), cheeses (seropod), herring salad (nightmare !) . Tea, juices, I suspect, and sausages from Biedronka. Dinners - monotonous, still meat, once a week fish (flounder). And everything has to be asked to be added. There will be no cheese, if you do not ask for it, you will not get it. Every day there was no water for tea. On the table where you eat your meals, potted flowers with the ground sticking out and sleeping flowers to eat - an appetizing sight. Soup served under the faculty in a bowl (first time I saw something like that). Beach equipment is falling apart in hand. A massacred place, certainly not for such money. The only plus is that there is a large parking lot + close to the city. To the beach a large piece through the city, where there are a million ""stalls"" - to get there you have to bypass the cavalcade of people. A horror so summarizes this place its kitchens and surroundings. A trip to the past such a name should have this m - ce ."
1748,"I have had relatively simple health problems, but extremely burdensome. 1, 5 years of treatment + gigantic money spent on drugs and visits, during which you had to draw all the information from the doctor, practically no dialogue. The result: complete lack of improvement + organism devastated by drugs (served in such quantities that meals became unnecessary) + desire to tear out the intestines. Change of the doctor - two visits and after the problem, apart from the fact that the organism regenerated from half a year after these doses of chemical piggery. It is a mistake to say that dialogue with the doctor or a good approach to the patient is not important. Sometimes this is the key. I advise against it. Apart from high quality medical equipment, I don't see any advantages."
1749,"Let's start with the advantages: good location (very close: tesco express, Kingstone Park subway, 3 stations from the airport). The reception is open 24 hours a day, we were able to check in earlier. But: it was extremely dirty there! A layer of dirt covered the entire room, both the floor covering, which has not seen a vacuum cleaner for a good month, and shelves and cabinets. The kitchen was just sticky, washing the glasses and plates twice. Bed linen and towels were fine, but staying in a dirty space wasn't overshadowed by any of the advantages. I'm sorry, but despite the helpful service she never wanted me to go back there."
1750,"For the detection of kidney cancer, so-called screening tests, similar to those used for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer, are not performed. Such tests are carried out on all persons at a certain age, e.g. after fifty years of age (breast and colorectal cancer). Dr. Bardadin claims that it is worthwhile to have an ultrasound once a year, which is already widely available. ""There is then a good chance that kidney cancer will be detected in time,"" Dr. Bardadin emphasized at a PAP conference on kidney cancer. In his opinion, men over 45 years of age, who are most exposed to this type of cancer, should remember this."
1751,"The hotel is very nice, the service is very nice, the rooms are cleaned every day, the food you wanted, unfortunately due to the weather in the North I do not recommend, for 7 days one of us had only sunny, we had to rent a car and drive south to sunbathe."
1753,"Eva. I do not recommend Dr. . T . Sleep. My story with 4 implants, which I decided to use, is 5 implants (one of them fell out in a short period of time after being placed and was placed again), out of which only one implant was left after 3 years. Perimplant bone inflammation was found by another doctor in July 2016 on the basis of an x-ray taken in February 2016 by Dr. Sypien who said that everything will be fine and the doctor knew that I was leaving the country. She had to remove the implants abroad, after six months of taking antibiotics. In addition, a healthy tooth right next to one implant had to be treated with a root canal immediately after implantation. Huge costs, three years of traumatic experience. What kind of doctor is it not for me to judge, but after collecting the cash, in case of complications, shows zero responsibility for the patient's condition."
1754,"What a lot to say. Whoever was in Ibis once knows what to expect, who wasn't supposed to do it, because it's such a good network travel standard. No fireworks, but it's okay. The Poznan Ibis Center has some advantages. This most important is the location a moment's walk from the Old Town, almost right on the Warta River. Really good and varied are also breakfasts at a reasonable price of about 30 PLN per person. The dishes from the restaurant did not try em. The price for too much sometimes pleasantly surprises sometimes not necessarily, but does not exceed 200 zł which for a 2-star hotel is acceptable. And maybe only these plastic rooms would need painting, because it is difficult to complain about their cleanliness or small network size and decor. This is how it is in Ibiza."
1755,"I decided to visit after reading positive opinions. Unfortunately, right at the entrance, the doctor's behavior was unpleasant for me. She was very dry in conversation, she felt that she treated me from above. She came to her with a specific problem, but nevertheless she found out to me that she should improve some other things in my face. She would only give me one star, but because she gave me some valuable tips to solve my problem she gives two. Unfortunately, the doctor should not only serve his knowledge but also give the patient a sense of security and understanding. I, on the other hand, came out of the office with crying and confidence at floor level."
1758,"We've been to the Forest Station twice. Clean rooms, beds could be better, bathroom (I have 190cm) as for me a little too small. on the floor panels which for our family is a SUPER solution - you know more dirt is collected on the carpet. Breakfast (included in the price of the room) - tasty, never lacking anything. in a word, good conditions for a good price I greet"
1759,"I've been to various hotels around the world, so I have a comparison. But I've never experienced such a nightmare anywhere. Worst New Year's Eve stay ever! A ruined bathroom, a dilapidated room, recreational equipment, the smell of musty, monotonous, old and ever-ending food, unpleasant and unprofessional service, dirty, no hot water, heating, sometimes electricity. One big ""drink on water"". ...a makeshift everywhere you look. In the ""recreation area"", half of it doesn't work or it's dirty. In the past, the sanitary unit detected staphylocococcus, which was reported in local newspapers. I do not recommend it! A waste of time, nerves and money!"
1760,"Gołębiewski hotels are probably known to everyone. Created perfectly for families with children, no matter what age. Attractions will be for everyone. Many swimming pools, jacuzzi, saunas. . . . . .you can stay there all day. The rooms are cleaned daily, very clean and well maintained. The food is very good and there is a lot of choice. Nice surroundings to walk around the hotel, you can also go for a walk to Mikolajki. For kids year-round ice rink, bowling alley, game room, outdoor playgrounds, play room in the hotel, horse riding. . . paradise. It is also possible to rent a motorboat / yacht. In short, you can't get bored! We recommend it, regardless of the season or the weather! The rest will be 100% successful !"
1761,"Hotel Oylum Park is located in Icmeler district of Marmaris. A week full of excitement in Marmaris - the gem of the Aegean Turkey coastline spent in * * hotel . The hotel is a well-kept, 3 floors - not large, intimate. Reception desk at the entrance does not make an optimistic impression, however, to go further the situation improves to get full satisfaction at ok . 100m2 swimming pool with fresh, clean and b. warm water. The rooms and bathrooms are tidy, cleaned daily, nice big balconies by the rooms. Main Restaurant - buffet dishes, Turkish cuisine, pool bar. All inclusive - do not put all at once, drink moderately at the bar, cool bartenders, no bartenders and waitresses was a minus. I recommend as a hotel in standard * * * * at a low price."
1762,"The doctor seemed to me very unpleasant, dry, haughty and judging. She felt treated me as a scared teenager, who had a fallout (and I am 28 years old). However, the real reason for my visit was a routine annual check-up, before which I accidentally missed my period. The doctor did not interview me properly, did not offer me a cytological examination, which is standard in other offices, did not examine my breasts. All the time she referred to me with incomprehensible resentment. The visit was paid for + the cost of ultrasound in addition - even more so I do not want to believe that this is how you can treat the patient. Greetings"
1763,"This special hotel was managed by Colonel Securitate's counter-intelligence colonel, who operated under the cover of the director of the building. Colonel DIE was the deputy director. Photographing documents, notebooks, letters and notes of guests, looking through their belongings left in the rooms was a ""hotel"" routine. The agents were, of course, the ""prostitutes"" who were sitting in the hotel, but also the ""intellectuals"", ""artists"" and a large number of guests who were sitting in the bar and restaurant. The Athénée Palace has become a prototype for other ""hotels"" of this kind under the name of the secret service. Not only in Bucharest, but also in other cities of the ""people's democracy"" countries."
1764,"Unfortunately, the doctor is nice to me, but to have her cured me professionally, she removes the cavities, and then she informs me that the fun can break down, which of course happens, so again you have to go spend the money, and the prices are very high and there is no difference whether large or small cavity, moreover, the person who I flew and cured the teeth, after the visit got some infection in the gums. Unfortunately I advise against it."
1765,"I don't recommend a doctor. We drove with our son over 700km to meet him and consult the effects of two surgeries already performed in anticipation - the prospect of another one. He did not give any reliable information and did not read the documentation of his son from previous consultations with other doctors and discharges from the hospital. Summing up the visit we hope that it will be good (now it is overgrown coil) and if it will not be good, we have to report (if the coil will grow overgrown and will not be able to pee). Besides, the visit lasted 10 minutes. For such a good specialist we expected something more from our husband. . . Maybe the doctor wanted to have some time off, because we were the last patients."
1766,"Rather nice, although he seemed not very interested in the problem that came to 'em. He said, ""He sees nothing in his ear. "" . . .and I had the impression that this was the ""end of the subject"". However, when he didn't give 'em away so easily, he recommended further investigation. The downside is that he very briefly examined the infection of the upper airways. He reported it to him on the occasion of a visit related to an ear problem. The doctor agreed to examine me, but he did it as if from an unwillingness, and during the cursory examination he found nothing or recommended anything. (3 days after this visit I had to go again with the infection to an internist). All in all, the assessment was neutral because, however, the main reason for my visit was examined by the doctor, and he ordered an additional examination."
1767,"I'm a patient of Dr. Ossowska's, but she definitely decided to change my doctor. The doctor doesn't take the patients seriously, she is not nice and doesn't listen to what is being said to her. When I enter the office I have the impression that I have been given an extraordinary grace, but she decided to accept me. I think that you should have absolute confidence in the gynaecologist, but she does not inspire my confidence. Today I went to the clinic to get a prescription, as it turned out that the doctor did not accept today, although there was other information in the schedule. She met me at the reception desk, she didn't even want to talk to me, she just nodded her hand to let me go, without even saying a word. She was too busy with the phone. ."
1768,"I'm using this package at work and I have to admit that it was hard for me to switch from an older version to 2007. The different layout of the stripes, icons, it all made me unable to figure out what is where. At home I use the free OpenOffice, which is similar to the old Office and I am more happy with it. It's not that Office 2007 doesn't have any advantages, it's stable, it doesn't notice any mistakes in it, but what if I work on it uncomfortable. I strongly advise against it. ."
1769,"The lecture is chaotic (flowers on trees), you never know what it is about. As for the exercises, you should always be prepared, and you should report to the board. Then if you don't know something, it tries to help. But if you take "" at m"
1770,"The apartment is located in the very centre of the Old Town, just a few steps from the Market Square and only a few minutes walk from the Main Railway Station. At your fingertips the biggest attractions of Krakow, just ""under your nose"" restaurants, pubs, shops. The apartment is stylishly decorated and much more spacious than you can see in the pictures. The apartment has a stylish bathroom with a large bath, a large supply of clean towels, mineral water and coffee and tea making facilities. We lived in an apartment on the second floor overlooking an old, mysterious courtyard, which I think is a big plus, because no noise came there. A large comfortable bed and silence allow you to relax after many hours of visiting Cracow. Very courteous and attentive staff at the reception desk, the staff will help you organize trips to the most interesting places in and around Krakow. Good price as for accommodation in such a location. I recommend !"
1771,"When booking a hotel for a stay with 4 years old we did not get any information about the techno festival that took place, the frames fell into resonance from 19 to 6 am. . . The bill was added to the bill + 100zl which was finally decorated by the reception. . . Someone at our expense wanted to have fun. . . The overall haos is overwhelming. . . Every person I've come into contact with is inexperienced. . . . . . . .is not a hoddog box. . . The staff was nice but extremely inexperienced. . . If you book something, print it, sptawfz what you sign. I was supposed to write a lawsuit for a free kayak for 1h but the morality was up: - D Suggestion or hotel or party . No info on the site . Call and see if you're getting caught up in the night or the ... ."
1772,"The place I strongly recommend . Nice staff, very discreet, familiar with the tourist side. Rooms are clean, well-kept, available TV with a camera view from the car park, fridge, bathrooms in the rooms. On the ground floor there is a playground for children, a small pool, a conference room. Meals in the guesthouse are delicious, homemade, for breakfast Swedish table. I strongly recommend it, there were many times and I will definitely come back."
1773,"Unlike many other celebrities, this one is really accessible and to the point. You talk freely and don't feel this barrier when you can ask and explain various things that are important to the patient and sometimes just shame to ask others. I having a problem in my back for which my pregnancy was probably responsible got a referral to the area for rehabilitation. After 10 treatments, it was probably worse with me than when she started these treatments and she didn't risk me and she didn't take me for the next series. And when she found me at Mr. Olkowski's, the pain disappeared for a while and after a few days I stopped hurting. This is the lesson that you have to go with your health to the proven ones and then there are no disappointments."
1774,"I had a terrible stomachache and I didn't have a period I went to this doctor because she was taking it and told me that it was some kind of inflammation that I had an extra condition, in the evening of the same day I got a terrible bleeding and I lost consciousness and I was hospitalized in a hospital in Poznan and there I was operated on. It turned out that it was a pregnancy outside of the uterus which had a flare and all the blood spilled into my intestines. . . . .I was in a coma for a week and the doctors didn't give me much chance to survive. . . Somehow, I got out of it, but I almost lost my life because of this woman who doesn't know what to do. And you could have avoided this situation if she gave me an ultrasound and then you could have detected the pregnancy earlier. I really wouldn't recommend treatment for that woman!"
1775,"Unfortunately, the hotel is not recommended. The rooms are very old and just not pretty. Pillow swept out ! Very old and just not very comfortable . Internet close to zero . . . It did not connect wogole - it was so weak ! The service is not helpful and I would even say that it is not nice ! The problem already appeared when she asked me for glasses. . . . . .to the water! ! ! You were unhappy that I asked him where he got it from? ? ! And if the Internet wants it, it's at the reception desk! And how is it possible that I can ask Wogole to order me a taxi other than the one they recommend ! So she told me it's much cheaper and I'm asking for the one I want! Unfortunately, you were offended ! And that if she wants to, I can call from my room, she won't call me. Unfortunately, although the price is attractive, I will never go back there again ! ! ! And unfortunately, I do not recommend it! !"
1776,"I booked a stay in the george hotel from Saturday to Sunday . At night from Friday to Saturday at 2 . 00 at night the receptionist called me to confirm the reservation ! ! ! She could not logically explain her behavior and motive. I arrived at the hotel on Saturday, at the reception desk I heard, ""sorry"" and that was it! ! ! ! Due to the situation, I asked for a discount, I heard that nothing can be done and any contact with a late person is impossible because he has a weekend off! ! ! ! I resigned because I have no intention of making money for such a hotel. I wouldn't recommend that this hotel is catigoric! ! ! Because you'll never know when you're waking up... ."
1777,"Since this was the first visit and it was about advice rather than specific medical treatments I read about in my previous opinions, I can only say that I am satisfied with the visit. You have fulfilled what I expect from a good specialist, i.e. to perform the necessary examinations on the spot, to make a firm diagnosis, to refer to the necessary further examinations. It's too early for me to write out my paeans in honor of the Doctor, because our contact was too short and one time, but in the future it's very possible that I will be able to say that this is a top class doctor. That's what it looks like."
1778,"We spent two nights in the old hotel wing. The decoration of the rooms is far from modern . It comes from the sevenites. But they were impeccably clean. The bathroom was renovated with only furniture that brought back childhood memories. Breakfast is full, dinner is also full. The staff is polite and helpful. All in all, it was worth its price."
1779,"I spent two days training here anyway: - location good, maybe a little tightly knocked into the plot, but such conditions were - the layout of the rooms a little untypical but this is related to the size of the plot - the temperature of the room room deserves a minus, which, judging by the entrance door was created in place of the terrace. On the day of training the girls were cold. Plus for coffee from the machine. The minus for me was dinner - on the second day it was ok but on the first day, as everyone said, the food was tasteless, undercooked meat, summer meat. I think it's a good idea for a business trip."
1780,"The hotel from the outside was pretty good, unfortunately already after the entrance it turned out that not everything will be so cool, and in total it will be nothing. . . The staff at the reception desk is completely not interested in guests, preferring to answer private phones. In the whole hotel there is an information that on this day the restaurant is open only until 18, after which it turns out that today is completely closed, the next day also does not. You can go to the restaurant next door, where you will pay almost 30 zloty for soup. Breakfast is modest and cold. Hot tea water in the heater was yellowish. At night a couple of drunken ladies decided to do a concert in front of the hotel. The staff did nothing for over an hour so that the rest of the guests could go for a walk in silence. The hotel is maintained mainly with events and conferences. Individual guests do not care. The air conditioning is not working, the fridge in the room is not there and I advise against choosing this hotel."
1781,"Location great , very sunny place . Good starting point for exploring the island . Hotel medium because of cockroaches . Service and food on the plus side . The pool is also quite pleasant if not for the ongoing renovation. The rooms are quite nicely furnished, cleaned daily, if it wasn't for the cockroaches, it would be great but unfortunately it's a big disadvantage. The lack of air conditioning in the room is a small problem in relation to cockroaches."
1782,"Fogographs on the internet show the inside of the castle, which resembles an authentic old castle. The Reception and Lobby and the Swimming Pool are made in style. However, the rooms and the rest of the interior, especially the rooms do not resemble anything special as usual. Take a look at the photographs . When you look out the window, you see. . . . ...the roof of the inner child. The roof of the courtyard itself is covered with a large green plachta, on the walls there are contemporary painted coats of arms. THERE IS NOTHING AUTHENTIC THERE, USUALLY ROOMS WITH A VIEW OF THE COURTYARD ROOF. Do not be fooled by the pictures on the website. The objects hanging on the walls are commonplace objects pretending to be ancient or modern horrors. Generally = a sense of KICK and SUSTAINABILITY . We and the child disappointed . We feel SIGHT, the Hotel Pretends to do something MORE - to take the money down. NOT WORTH THE PRICE! The mattresses are weak and cheap. After 3 nights I had enough. I do NOT recommend it."
1783,"In the case of almost 2000 overweight and obese people from all over Poland participating in the weight reduction program, the total reduction amounted to as much as 9 tons (5 kilograms on average), the reduction of excessive blood sugar levels was achieved in 47% of cases, cholesterol levels were reduced in 32% and hypertension was reduced in 65%. The participants met not only with doctors and nutritionists, but also with physiotherapists and psychologists "" The costs of the programme were in this case three times lower than the estimated cost of treating complications of obesity. This is an excellent business"" - emphasized prof . Jarosz . Scientists emphasized that ""Keep Balance"" is the first comprehensive program that shows the right direction in the effective fight against obesity and overweight, now considered the greatest health threat in the world. According to forecasts recently published by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the obesity epidemic will continue to grow rapidly over the next few years - including in Poland, which has risen to the top of the most obese populations in Europe."
1784,"The tripod bought 'em because of the levels, wanted 'em to do panoramas. The tripod is unstable especially when loaded with a camera - it bends. The legs are falling apart so you can't hold a fixed position. The lower spirit level, despite these drawbacks, somehow works, but the upper one is not able to set a fixed level because. . . . the vertical element is ejected by curves . It bends even more if you lock it by turning . It is the blame of this element's locking design, which is asymmetrical . So you get quite a bit of rubbish at a price typical for a tripod. Only that we buy the rubbish."
1785,"The Rector's Representative for the Ministry of Economy and Labour and Social Policy. Krzysztof Chlebus, Ph.D., emphasized that this is ""a very advanced, scientifically promising project which gives great hope in terms of therapy"". He explained that ""it takes a very long time from the moment a certain scientific result is created to implement it into clinical practice and it takes a lot of money to document the effectiveness of such a method on a larger scale"" . He stressed that in order for the method to be applied on a larger scale, it takes, in the first stage, about a dozen or so million PLN to expand the laboratory and clinical base. Ultimately, it may be even several tens of millions of zlotys for conducting clinical research. ""In fact, we are talking about looking for good, reliable, loyal investors who will help us ( ... ) open a production line"" - he added . He hopes that ""this project will be a flagship (...) not only for the University of Gdańsk and (...) will create mechanisms that can be used in the future to deal with and finance other treatment projects"" ."
1786,"Very nice hotel ! Situated close to the gondola, although we used to use a ski bus running back and forth all the time. The hotel's friendly staff, especially the amazing waiters and restaurant manager are worth mentioning! ! Delicious - varied and elegantly served dinners! Very comfortable beds, pleasant bathrooms and well cleaned, although a little too small standard rooms! ! ! There is also quite a nice spa, helping to regenerate after daily effort on the slopes! To sum up, a great stay in the Luna Hotel worth its price!"
1787,"A young and good doctor. Young means ambitious and in my case I certainly felt that the doctor is investigating with all the strength of the problem very much involved in my case. I feel your doctor's calling. You can go to Mr. Bartkowiak boldly, I'm sure he will do his best."
1788,"Hello, baby: ) So far I'm not trying to get a baby, it's still a little too early, but I'm already worried about the future treatment, whether it will be effective. Also, I've been following various gynaecologists from the NFZ and no diagnosis and thus no treatment. . . . following the persuasion of my future mother-in-law went to consult another gynaecologist from the nfz and said that this disease is not to be treated at the clinic and gave me the card of another doctor, namely Grochowicz who supposedly specializes in the treatment of infertility, maybe the opinion is not too good but in the next month I will go to him for a consultation and clarify some doubts, maybe it will calm me down a little bit. . . . .as you write something on my martinellka email @ o2 ."
1789,"In his view, the creation of such a network and research platform will take several years, as this requires changes to certain activities and procedures, in particular those related to obtaining patients' consent for the use of data that were previously only for medical purposes, such as swabs taken from them. In Poland, the leading centre of the project is the Medical University of Łódź, which cooperates with a network of family doctors in Łódź and Białystok. And so, in Łódź, it cooperates with the university ok . 50 family doctors who have been trained in good clinical practice and have already participated in large studies conducted by the university. ""This year we are starting examinations of patients with flu symptoms"" - said prof . Godycki - Ćwirko ."
1790,"A nice person and undoubtedly with a great attitude towards children - which I judge from the perspective of the waiting room and not as a patient. However, in the case of an intervention requiring a little more than the removal of a superficial change - I do not recommend . The case required an incision and she tried hard to discourage me from using her services. It is a pity that this discouragement was ineffective, as I find now after months of suffering negative side effects - not so much the whole treatment as a strictly surgical intervention."
1791,"The slogan ""Time is the brain"" captures the essence of the problem well. The sooner the patient is placed in a specialist stroke unit (there are about 150 of them in Poland), the better. As prof . Anna Członkowska from the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, every 20 minutes lost significantly reduces the chances for the patient to return to full efficiency. Imaging tests facilitate the location of the stroke, while the administration of fibrinolytic drugs reduces the extent of damage. However, it must be administered no later than 4 or 5 hours after the stroke. Due to too late arrival at the hospital and numerous contraindications the method can be used only in a few percent of patients. Stroke, as explained by prof . Membership in 80% of cases is due to ischemia of the brain, in 15% of cases. - The stroke was caused by a rupture of an artery in the brain, and in 5% of cases it was subarachnoid hemorrhage."
1792,"Hello everyone. I've been to Dr. Mrozicki's many times. He always provides professional information and performs his work reliably. First of all, he is a doctor with great experience and the right approach to the patient. Without hesitation, I decided to have the prostate removal procedure (one day!) - with full success. I have only positive opinions about visits and treatment, so I can give the highest rating. And the comments with claims for 80 PLN for a visit? Is it a lot? Please consider how much you pay for a visit to the hairdresser ... . Definitely a urologist worth recommending !"
1793,"I am generally satisfied with the visit and the help I received. Mr. Dr. Dr. only builds his authority unnecessarily on the basis of the excessive use of specialist terms, including Latin, in contact with the patient. I did not like the fact that according to Dr. Dr., all the other doctors who treated or treated me were not very competent. It was a sad, or rather inappropriate joke that even a poor patient should sometimes see what the health service should look like and come to a private practice. A doctor who likes to shine and thus forgets to make a few referrals, including to the hospital and standard laboratory tests."
1794,"I'll definitely recommend it. CHoc is a total typhoon on the board and every moment you have to correct it this guy is cool. If there's something you don't understand, it'll explain how you're going to approach him. What's the most important thing that shortens the time...) . It's really worth it."
1795,"I've been visiting the doctor for 2 years. Several times she had m made botox , 2 times enlarged lips . Professionally, almost painlessly and effectively, because the effects of treatments were satisfactory for me. Almost 3 months ago, the Doctor performed a procedure with threads on several areas of the face. I decided to write, because the effects that I really fully see only now I, my husband, friends are sensational (the most pleasant is to see the surprised expression on the face of friends with whom you have not seen several months). Tension of the skin, shallowing of wrinkles, exaltation of my cheeks. . . She didn't think she was going to look so cool, the more so that right after the treatment the effects were small. I strongly recommend threads (and not only) from Dr Janczura. Milena"
1796,"She has had very different adventures with dentists. . . . .last year I was in a dental chair at Dr. Mazur's - a friend from the university recommended it to me. She had the top seven crushed by an outgoing eight. She knew that it wouldn't be easy to remove the roots of this tooth, but luckily I did. Perfectly and without pain : ) Really very, very recommendable. I'll add that I wasn't privately visiting only the cash register. And as you know, it often happens that going to the doctor for the health insurance, we can not count on the same care as going privately."
1797,"In the second one, designed as a playroom for children, there are tatami mats formed into a seat opposite which there is a game table with multimedia applications. The areas differ in colour: for adults it is white and for children it is coloured. The green capsules used by the architects, visible from outside the building, replace the balcony and form a cocoon. Saturation of the room with modern technologies is only partially visible. More is hidden in the walls or furniture. Furniture can hide, making room for multifunctional modules. It is worth noting that the use of furniture of appropriately selected sizes and shapes allowed to obtain a large free space of the room. Novotel and Microsoft have been cooperating for four years, which includes the introduction of the Xbox 360 game console to the offer of over 300 Novotel hotels worldwide."
1799,"The main character, Reynevan, is somehow not to be liked. Not a very good character . Plus, somebody keeps kidnapping him, and his friends are saving him. And all the time. After the fifth kidnapping, she gnawed my teeth off, because there are limits! Even in Hollywood movies, if you kidnap someone, it's once, and that's good. And not a dozen or so times ; ) Additionally, the pace of the action is jerked off: once the action is loose and boring, it gallops on the head and neck again - as in the case of Reynevan's notorious kidnapping. On the plus side I write down an interesting historical background (Hussite wars, about which she had almost no idea), interestingly and extensively painted by the author. And quite an interesting idea to make the main character a Silesian, not a Pole, but the center of action - Silesia. Finally something new. Nevertheless, I do not recommend buying the Hussite trilogy. Best to borrow in the library, not expecting anything great, read once and forget. Just what . Maybe my assessment is unfair, but if the trilogy had been written by someone else, she would have said m: pretty good. In Sapkowski's case she had m greater demands and I say to herself: yes. The name obliges. ."
1800,"The wedding in Arcadia? I do not recommend ! Arrangements from before the wedding turned out to be just one big bummer. The first incident at the entrance: the staff was not prepared to greet the young people with bread, salt and a glass of vodka. When the youngsters arrived at the gate, a quick ""provisional"", i.e. 3 slices of bread were quickly taken from the table. . When the guests received the rooms reserved for them, it turned out that they also had to pay for the newlyweds' room, which, according to earlier arrangements, was to be free of charge in the wedding price. . Moreover, it was established that everything that is suitable for eating after the wedding, e.g. cakes, cold snacks, is to be taken by the young people in their containers, which they prepared. In the morning, it turned out that the waiter STOP! all that was left, together with the cakes. We suspect, however, that the dishonest owner used the remaining food for another purpose. . . DNO."
1801,"Absolutely not five stars - unless it's Egyptian stars: ) . The hotel apart from the location and the view from the apartment, there is nothing that can be rated as five . Dirty carpets in the corridors, not wiped vomit after integration events, scratched walls, one hotel trolley, cleaning of the connector with acid substances during the day. A pompous receptionist in the SPA . Apart from that there is no taste in the interior design - the room where breakfasts are served - a better canteen. Everything is made ""cheaply"" or even of poor quality and from the rental company - all towels, napkins, tablecloths are sewn into the rental company chips. You pay a high price for the dog and from the hotel employee you can hear - Just don't let the dog go anywhere - she replied that I always clean up after my dog - a form of expression of thoughts by the staff to the guest - awesome. The food is correct and only correct . I think she could have spent the money in another hotel. Here - lack of honesty . So much for the topic: ("
1802,"Son turns 4 months old @ She bought m scissors as a spare for her grandparents . fatal scissors ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! awkwardly bulky, no access to burrs, it is impossible to cut nails with them uniformly (only a jerky line) Scissors that I have at home despite the worse appearance (they are all metal) are much better at the same time safe with rounded ends. In fact, these scissors would be considered dangerous because you can cut the cuticle through poor access to the nail. Perhaps if these were the first and only scissors that I would use, I would share the opinion of the other ladies, unfortunately, these are the next and definitely stand out in terms of use ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
1803,"She chose to stay in this hotel as a gift for my partner. She didn't disappoint me about the whole thing. The hotel is beautiful, well-kept, located in a great place. The kitchen is very good. Nice service. Super spa . I have only two notes. When making the reservation, she asked me for one big bed and got me the answer that it would. However, upon arrival, I found out that there are two joined beds. After my inquiry she heard m that all the rooms where the big beds are occupied and I can get an ""overlay"" for the bed? ? ? The second minus applies to the cleaning ladies. Our stay started on Friday and ended on Monday. On Saturday there was no one to clean the room, but on Saturday, seeing the ladies on our floor, they asked us to change our towels. They defended themselves by saying, there is a piece of paper hanging on the handle ""do not disturb"" - there was but two rooms away. So we could use more attention to detail and management."
1804,"The mRNA molecules are a carrier of information in the cell - ""documentation"" which, on the basis of plans stored in the DNA, allows the production of proteins. ""We have explained how human methyltransferases recognize the kapu structure at one of the ends of mRNAs and carry out its enzymatic modification. Capu is essential for the synthesis of proteins in cells. We have discovered that human methyltransferases recognize capu in mRNAs in a different way than viral proteins responsible for a similar process do. This knowledge gives rise to the search for such drugs that would block viral proteins and would be safe for people,"" comments Prof. Dr. hab . Janusz Bujnicki , head of a research group at MIBMiK and at the Adam Mickiewicz University. Janusz Bujnicki , head of a research group at the MIBMiK and at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, who led the project and is the author of the corresponding new article, together with the second author, Dr Marcin Nowotny , head of the group at the MIBMiK and Prof . dr hab . Edward Darżynkiewicz , head of the team at MIBMiK and Prof ."
1805,"Delicious food. As far as restaurants are concerned, there's absolutely nothing to stick to. Sauna zone ok . No pensioners from Germany have seen 'em. They rather choose sanatorium hotels. Here most are Polish families with children. I consider the stay a success. We'll try to come back here."
1807,"We were in this hotel with the family for the weekend. We got a room with a view of the allotment gardens and the parents on the blocks. Tragic view from the hotel. The pool is very crowded with people outside the hotel. It's going poor quality (felt like I was in the canteen). The food in the main restaurant is very poor, the waiters do not know what is happening. When she asked me about something the staff answered: she works here on her first day. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, our stay was not successful."

1809,"I was tempted to try it in the shop - as a novelty, she wanted to try it out, she used Glamorous m gel from the same company and it was great, beautiful smell and peeling by the way. This turned out to be a total failure, she used up 1 / 4 packs and had to put it away, it dried up my skin so much that the massacre, never had so much, especially the skin on my legs and belly became as if rough, not nice to the touch, 2 weeks had to be lubricated with a strong moisturizing lotion to be ok, the smell also does not knock, the manufacturer beautifully described what he proposes, but I was disappointed and in this matter, I definitely do not recommend"
1810,"as for 3 * which advertises, definitely not good, the lady at the reception did not want to accept the discount coupon from the booking portal saying that the hotel does not work with them, clean rooms without luxuries, standard rather hostel, they asked us for a double bed, we got 2 single beds - they claimed from others do not have"
1812,"This hotel was built in the typical highlander style of houses with sharply sloping roofs. However, the ""house"" was extended so that it has 3 floors with several rooms each. Rooms of decent dimensions and properly equipped, but the TV signal fades away. . . The whole object is lined with thick and soft carpets or carpets of the same pattern, marble stairs and wrought-iron railings, which all together gives the effect of a luxurious and deserving of one star more object. The building's ecological and energy-saving lighting also deserves praise. Also worthy of praise is a tasty kitchen and rotating, young waiters, quickly moving around the beautifully decorated dining rooms. I must also mention the basements hiding, among other things, massage parlor - I recommend treatments with Mr. Mario, who is trying not to take money for free. Generally a place worth a visit, but with a thicker wallet . -"
1813,"Location: stations, Taxi, Antałówka, PKP, Aquapark, Tesco, Gubałówka - all within a few steps. You can not hear the hustle and bustle of the street (even during the winter holidays). A room for 2 people is spacious enough, the bathroom is clean, there are towels, only WI - FI a little too weak. No hairdryers in standard rooms - only in apartments or can be rented from the reception. Breakfast is a lot and good. Nice helpful service. Furniture a little worn out, but who would sit there in the room! : Giewont outside the window compensates for everything (I recommend 4th floor). On site ski equipment rental ."
1814,"We spent one night (the last one) in this hotel during the tour ""Turkey - Taste of the Orient"". The advantages include a very good location in the centre and more good things are hard to write about. This is a very old hotel, worn out and in need of renovation. After the accommodation you had to replace two light bulbs in your room because they did not work. It follows that probably rarely anyone visits this hotel. The meal was not very varied, but apart from us there were almost no other guests in the hotel. The hungry ones were not laughing, but it was clearly not the standard of other hotels during the trip. The staff was friendly and helpful. Wi - Fi only worked in the area around the reception The pictures on the hotel's website do not correspond to reality at all. We do not recommend it."
1815,"It was the first time I was in the doctor's office when my condition did not allow me to straighten up. Quickly and at the same time very gently and taking care of my comfort, the doctor located the cause of the blockade. Diagnosis was smoothly transferred into the therapy and the recognition of the causes at the level of physical strain was extended by the psychological context. The doctor did not stop at eliminating the symptom. She made me aware of the sources of its appearance and what prevention can consist in . Apart from what was most important to me, it was also important what conditions for cooperation were created by her: punctuality, reliability, discretion and a beautiful office."
1816,"A great place to rest - at least in the period before the ""high season"". With rooms with windows facing the slope nice greenery, although cumbersome can be held in front of the windows (those did not last long) or in the restaurant (longer) corporate events. Better view and quieter (restaurant on the ground floor with possible events) will therefore be on higher floors. There are many attractions for everyone - a playground, an outdoor gym, playgrounds and, of course, the proximity of the thermal baths to which the hotel guests can walk from the hotel with the internal link in their bathrobes. I used to take advantage of the promotional prices of packages to enter the thermal baths, I do not know if there is such a possibility in the season. Nice service (reception), clean, tasty meals. This is a place where you can relax."
1817,"Hello! The hotel is not recommended with all my strength, which I do not have much left after staying in it. First of all: ""wonderful"" surprises in the form of cockroaches in the bathroom, humidity in the rooms, the terrible smell in the whole hotel, the hotel should undergo a major renovation! Secondly: the food was PASSIDE! I understand the British influence. But if the only vegetable for breakfast is a leaf of sadly dried lettuce, then the palate will be soaked. No bread. . . . . .unless someone calls toasted bread bread. So breakfast consisted of: beans in Breton style, toasted bread, marmalade (not to be confused with jam or even jam), fried eggs (optional), fried sausages, sliced melted cheese, tinned ham and the mentioned lettuce leaves. Thirdly: wifi expensive (15 euros for 7 days) which works well only in the lobby. . The reviews had to be written by me a few weeks after I came back so that the emotions would fall and the opinion would be objective and not exaggerated. Unfortunately, it is very unflattering anyway."
1818,"Hello. 2 months ago I underwent a complete nose correction in prof . Wójcicki . I am very happy with the choice of a doctor and she would make the same decision for the second time. Before the operation professor devoted enough time to me and answered all questions . His great experience and warmth in relation to the patient could be felt, which translated into relative calm before the operation: ) The professor informed me that my nose is a heavy case (curved septum, falling down, large holes) but the effect has exceeded my expectations. The shape of my nose is great! ! Professor has a good sense of aesthetics and fits the nose very well to the face. The whole convalescence went without pain and without complications. A nice aspect is the great interest and care for the patient: ) I recommend it ! !"
1819,"The hotel is located 200 metres from Metaxurigo metro station from which there is only one station to Omonia Square where you can change metro lines. The neighborhood is not very cozy with a few local pubs with coffee bars. When you walk from the hotel to Omonia Square (15 minutes walk) you will feel like on the balconies, hundreds of Bulgarians of Albanian Romanians with full bags waiting to return to the country. The hotel itself is located in a 4-storey building with a steep staircase without a lift. Small rooms with a sink inside and a tiny TV without Polish channels and only CNN and BBC . The biggest surprise for me was that the toilet and shower were common for the whole floor (I did not read it during the reservation) and this is the biggest minus for me. Breakfast from 7 to 10 but poor ground cheese, boiled eggs flakes but what can you expect for 90 € for 3 nights! ! ! Summing up the price makes wonders but rather good hostel than hotel ! ! ! !"
1820,"The hotel was very neglected, once it used to make a sensation (when it was new), now the period of celebration is behind us. . The room stinks of stool, mould, moisture, long time ago not ventilated and unheated, nasty! ! ! ! The ground floor, the balcony was overlooking the . . . ...that's it. . Despite the free rooms, we didn't get any sunshine with a view of the lake, maybe the view would compensate us for the stench in the room. There are no chairs, tables,, or anything on the balconies. We also ate dinner and breakfast, plus drinks for lunch and dinner, i.e. compote, coffee and tea. . Location by the lake is certainly an advantage, but the access to the hotel is terrible, you can damage your car such holes, ruts, stones."
1821,"It's strange, a bit like Dr. House, he doesn't show his feelings, I say I'm stressed because my mother died, no reaction, he reads in you like a card, and unfortunately 90% aptly, he talks about uterine surgery as if it was drinking coffee with milk, and I'm only 40 years old, she cried to me during the visit and after, she was naive thinking that if I go to the doctor and watch the tests, it won't happen to me what my mother (at the age of 45 they removed everything from her). But thanks to this visit I know what to do and I will not give up, the vaginal ultrasound examination was done very gently, recently at another doctor I was in a hell of a pain and that's nothing, and she was afraid of me, also in spite of the unpleasant distance she has to patients, I recommend! ! !"
1822,"Diagnosis: discopathy at L5 / S1 level. I have been under neurosurgical care for almost two years. After numerous consultations, rehabilitation, massages and other magical treatments - the pain in the lumbar region increased, but somehow it was possible to live. However, 10 January this year turned out to be the worst day in my life so far. She woke up and did not get up anymore. She couldn't walk or lie down and just live normally. The pain in her left leg was unbearable. The next rehabilitation, strong medications did not help, even worsened my condition. I was advised by a few neurosurgeons - the so-called top 5 of Warsaw medicine - all of them unanimously decided - OPERATION. However, none of the above mentioned people were able to guarantee me that the surgery will improve my situation, even some claimed that it could be worse. She was looking for help from many specialists, and thanks to the portal and positive opinions, she got to Mr. Grzegorz. Finally, she found me a specialist who presented dry facts based on many years of experience. At the beginning of March this year we started a difficult and long rehabilitation. It's June and I feel great - I'm practicing at home every day, I've returned to an active lifestyle and every day the vision of surgery disappears somewhere behind the horizon: ) Honestly and with full conviction I recommend cooperation with Mr. Grzegorz - a professional in every respect, and also an amazing man. However, I warn you - Mr. Grzegorz is not a sorcerer (although some patients claim so :) ) - if you decide to try, hard work, sweat and tears are in front of you - Reasons!"
1823,"A fantastic place at the foot of the Tatras. The rooms are functional and decorated with taste, excellent cuisine and atmosphere that makes you regret leaving. About the owner of the resort speak: ""Good Spirit of Podhale"" and probably hard to find a better term. Ela puts a lot of effort into making the guests feel at home - highlander evenings, intimate evening concerts, and specialties of her own. A great place for families with children! This is a unique place - we highly recommend it!"
1824,"Once again, we were guests of the hotel. It was not as successful a stay as the previous ones. No one informed us that the hotel was being expanded and we would be exposed to constant noise. Our room was adjacent to the extension and the view from the balcony was a construction site. Forging with a hammer, drilling from 7 . 00 to 18 . 00 . We had to move. Water in the cool pool . Cleanliness in the room mediocre . The children's stand in the toilet is terribly dirty . The towels, though, were greyish-yellow. And now something optimistic . A lot of attractions for children - excellent animations . Good and varied food . The service in the dining room at the highest level . Competent and friendly reception desk . When the expansion is finished, we will probably come again because maybe this renovation has a negative impact on everyone ."
1825,"Dr. Kowalski is a doctor who cares for his patients even when they are no longer treated by him and further treatment is carried out by specialists. She was prepared for the orthopaedic procedure and did not take with her the results of periodic examinations conducted in the doctor's office. Although it was the Saturday when I was asked by phone, the doctor made an appointment with my husband and gave me nicely prepared prints of the tests. He remembered my case and asked to let him know that everything went well. Many doctors disregard patients after hours of admission or when you don't pay for it. I think a good doctor should do like Dr. Kowalski"
1826,"I've been referred to by Dr. . Richard Gallus , who couldn't accept me because of his leave. I am grateful to Dr. Galus for this recommendation as she helped me to cure the embarrassing for me problem, which spent my sleep from my eyelids every day. I also confirm opinions of other patients: the doctor is very nice, efficient and energetic. She shows quite a lot of interest in the patient, you can see that she knows things and likes her work. Thank you, doctor! I hope that this comment will be an appropriate way to thank you for your help in my problem."
1827,"Renovated in the standard of the nineties . But with ambition. . . . .price ambitions. . . It's not rooms but clinics, the kitchen is a better canteen style. Everywhere far away, only suitable for families with children."
1828,"The hotel does not deserve 5 * . . . One of the few advantages is that the rooms are thoroughly and daily cleaned, but our room and bathroom with the plaster and paint falling off, with mould in the corners and on the ceiling (in the bathroom a huge leach of fungus), full of mosquitoes, floating stench of fungus and sewage. . . from conversations with other guests it appeared that everyone had similar problems. . . . after reporting that we want to change the room was proposed to us another in the same condition only dodtakowo even worse located (at the back of the hotel with windows to the street . . . ) option all inclusive: we did not meet with such in any of the Greek hotels 4 * - (theoretically of a lower standard) so in short - a very small choice, modest, poor. . the whole service ""jumps"" around the guests who do not have a purchased option all but decide to eat in the hotel restaurant; similarly, it was in the bar where guests paying in cash received something different, different from the ""rest""; no animation, the shortage of deck chairs by the pools, etc . . ."
1829,"Hotel Mercure Resort & Spa in Krynica Zdrój is an ideal place to go with your family. Wonderfully decorated and very comfortable rooms, comfortable beds. Nice service. And also a great spa and swimming pool, where every day we spent several hours: ) For the little ones additionally a ballroom and an animator. The food is delicious and healthy (this is very important for me). Breakfast buffet - a large choice. Also in our package were dinners. The hotel offers free parking for hotel guests. An additional advantage is the location of the hotel. Close to the Park Mountain and the centre of Krynica - water pump room, promenade. Daily walks in the open air made our stay more pleasant. In my opinion, the hotel deserves 4 and pol stars. To the Mercure Hotel in Krynica Zdrój we will return for sure! Also in winter for skiing ."
1830,"These tiles are a terrible piece of crap. They look nice, but only before they are laid, in fact they look like nothing on the floor. She bought m white and black tiles, on white you can see every spot, which can and is normal because they are white, but it is difficult to bring them clean. The black ones are tragic. Basically, they are no longer black, after being brushed they are grey, full of streaks and strange spots. Besides, the tiles are very faulty. The price is not appropriate to the quality, these tiles are not worth any price, and certainly not the price the manufacturer offers. I strongly advise against it."
1831,"The exception is nodular sclerosis - a rare genetically determined disease in the course of which epileptic seizures usually occur before the first year of life. This disease can be detected in a child already in the womb, as it is characterized by the occurrence of heart tumors. Polish scientists under the guidance of prof . Sergiusz Jóźwiak from the ""Monument - Children's Health Centre"" Institute in Warsaw observed that by performing cyclic EEG examinations in these children, changes in brain electrical activity can be observed early and drugs can be administered even before the epileptic seizures occur. Such a procedure reduces the risk of intellectual disability in the little ones. An international research project EPISTOP is currently underway to confirm these observations."
1832,"The doctor was the only neurologist with whom 'em were and who correctly diagnosed my illness at the first visit. Additional examinations were not necessary because the treatment I had received had brought me relief and a clear improvement. Before that, there were several neurologists and family doctors who did not help me. The doctor keeps me private all the time and I am very satisfied. I highly recommend the doctor because she has an incredible knowledge of the brain arteries and you can do a doppler examination of the brain arteries on her visit. Going to the doctor should be prepared for big queues because patients come to her from far away, I was just waiting and I had a chance to find out that some of them are even 150 km away! ! to get to her, but it's really worth it. The doctor takes as much time as necessary and does not look at the watch."
1833,"This hotel is so big that I don't recommend this hotel for couples with children had a room on the first floor where all the time almost till the morning you could hear the disco which was very tiring and the club was on the floor - 1 . . . . . cleaning the rooms was like that, the floor was always dirty and did not replenish the bathing fluids. . . . . . . . . and it happened three times that the room was untidy. . . . . . . .as to the food was good but not very good. . . . . .we won't be going back there anymore, and the rest of it was nice and nice, and we organized ourselves. . . . . ."
1834,"Doctors also showed that patients do not take sufficient care of oral hygiene - less than half of the respondents were in satisfactory condition. It is even worse in patients with coronary artery disease - people who should take care of it especially because chronic inflammation increases the risk of further heart infections, infarctions, complications, may promote arrhythmias, heart failure. Kamiński pointed out that improper oral hygiene may also be conducive to autoimmune diseases. Doctors also showed that too many people still smoke cigarettes, with women having more trouble quitting. The Białystok Plus study also showed that 30% of the respondents who agreed to the sleep test have dangerous breathing disorders while sleeping. Kaminski said it was a lot."
1835,"She's been carrying herself for a long time with the intention of getting a nose job. As long as I can remember she considered it to be the biggest drawback of her appearance - my nose was hunchbacked, twice broken, and on top of that there was an annoying defect in the nasal septum which, after the previous unsuccessful operation, constantly hindered my normal breathing, on top of that my small breasts, which increased my uncertainty about my appearance. However, the thought of several surgeries was paralysing for me. Six months ago, I was referred to Dr. Zachara by an acquaintance and she decided to visit me and all my concerns disappeared. The doctor treated the case very professionally, giving me all the details of the procedure. Eventually, after many years, I decided to have the surgery. How many people thought that two such complicated treatments would involve suffering and a very long recovery, as it turned out, was nothing more wrong. The doctor assured that a simultaneous operation is as possible and very beneficial for the patient. Today it is 10 days since the surgery and I have beautiful, shapely breasts and a shapely nose that I have always dreamt of. It was the best decision in my life! ! ! ! ! So I encourage all ladies not to be afraid of making their dreams come true, all the more so when in the hands of a specialist like Dr. Zachara. Thank you! ! ! !"
1836,"The castle is worth visiting the beautiful terraces, guided tours approx. I do not recommend staying in the castle hotel and eating in the restaurant! ! ! She booked a stay much earlier and asked me for details, there were to be two nights, breakfasts and two dinners (information confirmed on the day of booking the stay and on arrival at the hotel). Breakfasts poor and ""who's first the better"". For the first dinner (ceremonial by candlelight) we received an appetizer: sliced tomatoes with mozzarella, asparagus soup (spiced up!), the main course (the chef did his best), beef cheeks with buckwheat groats and lots of Brussels sprouts which were taken out of the water and thrown on the plate (inedible dish - venous meat), dessert cake with apple and lots of raisins. On the second day of supper we didn't receive a meal! ! ! ! The package includes one dinner for two days ! The translation of the poorly prepared by the ladies at the reception that they are new and apologize. Do not use the services of this hotel and restaurant ! ! ! ! ! ! The room: small and smelled musty, the bathroom had a falling shower. I don't know what they got 3 stars for."
1837,"For now I'm after my first visit, I have another one next week. The doctor seems to be in a hurry, impatient and assumes in advance that the patient knows what to do. There is a lot to do in terms of approaching the patient. As for the examination itself, it was all right. Unfortunately, I have to come to the next visit to get my glasses, because during this visit it didn't work out - according to the doctor she was undecided. . . I don't know what this indecisiveness was about - every time I put on a glass she didn't see my smallest font well, which she honestly informed me about . . . . . .should she have pretended? That is why she was given m eye drops, examination of the fundus of the eye and only next week and for another 100 PLN I will know what glasses I should wear. I don't know if this is normal procedure because I have no experience with ophthalmologists. We'll see what happens next week. . ."
1838,"I consider our stay in Pension Vicoria to be successful. The owners - I have nothing to reproach them and this is a big plus in the end we pay and live with strangers. I just broke down that we got a room on the top, she didn't think to ask about such things when she booked me a room :) BUT IT HAD ITS PLUS - THE VIEW FROM THE WINDOW - WONDERFUL! ! ! - I enclose a photo. She bought me breakfasts for the whole family and she felt nice because she didn't have to prepare them, it was ok for me. Free car park - cool, for this view from the window again: )"
1839,"I have no idea where the same positive comments come from. I bought this product just because of them and let 'em down, I thought that for this price it would shave much better and here's the prank. . . I sew shaves terribly badly so that I have to improve with an ordinary razor, and the top shaves well and even very well, but it does not take much time. I personally shave up every two days and it takes me about 3 minutes to shave down (sews) a single-use razor because I need to improve unfortunately, so I think the purchase failed. . ."
1840,"I sincerely advise against this doctor as the one leading the pregnancy. He does not make referrals for laboratory tests even though he makes them do and bring them in, he brazenly lies that they are not reimbursed (e.g. . toxo, rubella, HIV, HCV). Up to 16 tc did not do me any ultrasound (even this mandatory, screening), and the referral only gave for blood and urine! ! ! When asked about other referrals or ultrasound, he said that I am ""young, slim and healthy"" so why me. The gynaecological examination - without gloves, takes maybe 10 seconds. And according to the doctor, ""numerous bacteria in urine"" in a pregnant woman is not a problem and you do not have to do anything about it. . . On his last visit he said that a pregnant woman is only a problem. A doctor who can only write a prescription for contraceptive pills. He does it without a problem and sometimes even you in registration. And I also got caught up before the pregnancy to burn the erosion. Of course, privately. . . NEVER LET HIM EVER LET HIM CARRY YOUR PREGNANCY! ! !"
1841,"We organized a wedding reception at the Camelot Hotel. We also used to stay overnight. The hotel is very well prepared to receive wedding guests, in our case the wedding was on ok . 120 people. The facility is well maintained, the white room is elegant, there is little need to decorate it nicely. The owners of the wedding receivers are trying to meet all the expectations of their clients. The service is nice (especially Mr. Sebastian), although it is known that before this type of event you have to say out loud what you expect. The food is very tasty. Hotel rooms are modern, neat and clean. We also recommend that when organizing a large event take out additionally the lobby - great thing, you can provide service of a professional bartender. Generally, the facility is really at a high level. I recommend, both for large events and intimate trips to Szczawno Zdroj."
1842,"It can be [ / b ] The lecture is obviously boring, I wanted to sleep in class. Interesting was so called . chalk dust - chalk trampled on the floor by the Doctor. Laboratories - more interesting: although the programs were difficult, the Doctor always helped in writing, if there was any problem, if the program did not want to work. Of course two colloquia, you had to write programs. Improving the colloquia of course not easy for a beginner programmer. On the afternoon I sat 'em for 2 hours in his office so I should prepare myself for the torment. The first test (multiple choice) was difficult to pass - for a good answer 1 point, for an incorrect 0 . The improvement was better: 2 points for the correct one, 1 for close to the correct one. And I advise you not to take it down - not to pass at once and the re-test course! It's just a lot to know from Turbo Pascal: |"
1844,"We got to the Cycle On Hostel by chance in the middle of the night. There wasn't a single place available in other places. . . ...and it's very good that we didn't get to another place! First of all, great service: people who are open to others, nice and smiling, who help us with every time of day and night. Spacious hostel, rooms and bathrooms are clean. And besides all that - the location - nothing to add, nothing to take away. Literally 5 minutes away from Neptune and at the same time the building is situated in such a place that at night it is quiet despite such a short distance from the busiest street where it is full of tourists and children. If we will still have a chance to spend the night in Gdansk, we will surely come to Cycle On again. With a clear conscience I recommend"
1845,"I made a reservation for a room in Novotel Katowice for three nights and during the second night my patience was exhausted. On the first evening after eating dinner around 23rd . 20 asked 'em at the reception desk for an extra blanket for my daughters and heard 'em that in a moment the blanket will be delivered to the room. Unfortunately for about 20 minutes no one with the blanket showed up. I unfortunately at that time I couldn't go to the bathroom and I couldn't get ready for bed because I was waiting for the hotel staff. He called 'em after 20 minutes at the reception desk and unfortunately, the conversation made 'em feel like a fucking hotel guest. Today, after returning to the hotel, I went to the restaurant for dinner, unfortunately again nervous. After ordering the dishes and waiting for a longer time, my wife asked me why we were not given the so called ""waiters"". So, I came up to the bar and asked the waitress to give me a waitress and she started to explain to me that I'm giving myself a waitress when I order meals, but she'll kindly give me one. Dinner bill of 250 PLN and I'm supposed to ask for the waitresses that got 'em poorer than the guests at the table next door? I'm missing the words"
1846,"A very good specialist and man . He sees a man in a sick person, not another case. He explains in a reliable and understandable way what is wrong with whom, what the treatment consists of, or, as in my case, what will be done during the operation, what complications may arise after the operation, etc. I am satisfied with the way Dr. Bishop has treated and guided me. I am satisfied with the way Dr Tarnowski treats and guides me. Unfortunately, I have been told that the doctor is no longer taking part in Griffins and I do not know what to do next. I do not know why (if it is true) our doctor is no longer present. I wonder where he is taking it now? She heard me that in Koszalin. As someone knows, I ask for an entry in this place. I recommend Dr. Bishop. I recommend Dr. Tarnowski to anyone who suffers."
1848,"I've been having problems with my sexuality. At first he asked about everything and noted down, he asked about physical health, also about life issues, then health, then about how the relationship goes, about misunderstandings, conflicts and so on. He was honest. Then he directed to laboratory tests and only then he ordered to come back. He said that whether we take the right drugs or hormones will depend on the results. I think that's how it should be. A nice man, he's like that, he doesn't feel uncomfortable, you see, he has experience. As for me, he's worthy of recommendation."
1849,"She was doing a breast augmentation for Dr. Bienkowski. I am 2, 5 months after the surgery and I am very happy, happy, this can not be described. At the first visit, the doctor measured and determined which implants. You girls should rely on the opinion of the doctor and it is completely because he is a master in his profession and will make you a perfect figure. The operation went without any complications (I didn't have any drains, bruises as the girls often describe here at other doctors). Dr. Wieslaw is a very nice man and the whole staff is great. She chose me as a doctor because my friend was doing a breast augmentation 7 years ago and she is beautiful and very happy. Whatever I will want to do in the future or anyone of my relatives is only with Dr. Bieńkowski because he is 100% trustworthy. Girls and women don't think about whether to do a breast augmentation or not, only if you have too little or none as in my case it was 75A and it is 75C! And that's a big C! Make up your mind! Pain after the operation is not so much a nuisance, because so many girls go through it, you forget the moment, time passes quickly. Recently she has been waiting 3 or 5 weeks for the surgery and there is so much time after. It was the best decision in my life. I warmly greet Dr. Wieslaw and recommend to everyone such a wonderful man and a professional. Ilona"
1850,"we combined our business stay (3 days) with a holiday in Mera Spa Hotel and we do not regret choosing a modern, thoughtful, nice Spa but a mini Jacuzzi, we did not use treatments because there were no free terms, I do not know if there was a lot of people willing or not enough service? ? not cheap but very good Italian restaurant, very good and varied breakfasts in the rooms (overlooking the sea) feel the breeze of sea breeze, to the center of Sopot and the pier walking half an hour. I recommend"
1851,"I think that Dr. Drzewiecka is a very good pediatrician. She's been treating our daughter from the first days to the present moment it's been 5 years now. You can't feel anything. The doctor is very nice, direct. She's very sincere and has a very good attitude towards children. . I must admit in all honesty that I have never slept with such a good paediatrician and such a wonderful person as PANI DR, EWA DRZEWIECKa. . hello. MOM'S ESTER...)"
1852,"The wife found Mr. Bachank on an internet portal of the well-known doctor.pl type. He is really nice, polite, trustworthy and so on. Meanwhile, during pregnancy a serological conflict occurred, which was discovered only after the birth. I consider this to be a cardinal mistake of the doctor who stopped testing for the conflict in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The result was hemolytic disease of the baby and obvious problems during the next pregnancy. (The wife was not eligible for anti-D immunoglobulin because of the conflict during pregnancy. ) I do not know how to assess the fact that the doctor, knowing about the complicated wrapping of the baby with the umbilical cord at the end of the pregnancy did not react. As a result, the baby was born at the edge of acidosis, by a caesarean section after many hours of normal childbirth, and a nervous search for an anesthesiologist in other hospital departments."
1853,"Today it was my first time with the Doctor - she chose me on the basis of opinions on the Internet and she did not disappoint me - a charming man and an excellent specialist who clearly likes his work. The doctor explained to me professionally all the pros and cons of individual therapies and medicines, chose the most suitable way to fight with the disease for my lifestyle, wrote everything down precisely and even prescribed additional ""emergency"" medicines. The visit took place at the Dermed clinic, where she had previously been with a few ""aces"" and effectively discouraged me from treatment (hasty, superficial visits, lack of any information about the therapy and the interview about previous drugs that she used m, in a word - total beaker). That's why I recommend this lady among the many who work there, she's a real treasure!"
1854,"All in such a way that people who come here alone, with families or in larger groups will feel good in the hotel. The hotel guests waking up in the morning will be able to count on a beautiful view of the surrounding forests. Since it is a sports hotel, the indoor swimming pool is already visible in the lobby. The recreational infrastructure of the hotel also includes an additional outdoor swimming pool, four tennis courts for football, handball, basketball and volleyball (including beach volleyball)."
1855,"Unfortunately, the money was thrown into the mud for a private visit to your doctor. Maybe nice, but on a 3D ultrasound she didn't see my baby because she turned around. Instead of giving us a moment to walk, the doctor found out that she was covered up and after the examination. 200 zloty erased and said that I would see the baby when he was born. . Yeah, the regulation 20 minutes have passed."
1857,"Thanks to Mrs. Beata and her assistant, I believe that you don't have to be afraid of the dentist, especially if you get into such professional and professional hands. Honest recommendations, nice service, practically painless approach to the subject and this computer anesthesia. . . . ayæ fairy tale: D wogle not feel. RECOMMEND! ! ! ! ! ! !"
1858,"Doesn't sound professional. I hope that this has not written the real ""owner"" of this name, because as long as these negative comments would not alienate me, this is pathetic and just by frustration written . I hope that the mentioned psychologist this frustration however was not, because it would be very badly testified about him. A distanced person would have looked at the fact that there are more positive comments, and continue to do their job. She didn't want me to be treated by someone so distanced from internet trolls."
1860,"He used 'em in May 2015. The linen was unchanged, you could smell the smell of the previous client. The hotel in the case of this facility is a word out of the ordinary. It would have been more fortuitous to call it a hostel. As for this level of service, the prices are far too high (although I believe that cleanliness is an integral part of any civilized hotel). The morning breakfast was also consumed by 'em in the midst of dirt and disorder (dirty tables, dirty floor) and out of the window, more receipts in the form of lying cigarette butts. I do not recommend to anyone this paraphernalia"
1861,"Unfortunately we were not allowed to live in a wooden building because it was under renovation, but we certainly want to go back there. The surroundings of the manor house is beautiful, the rooms and the bathroom are clean, the room has too many beds so it was cramped. Breakfast is modest, but good, plus coffee from the machine. Tucholski Manor House is a great base for bike trips and walks in the forest. The owners are very nice so the distaste that we will not live in a wooden hotel quickly disappeared."
1862,"Unfortunately, DA - 5200 is a very expensive maintenance device as well as its incorrect measurements! Paid for calibrated new device in VI . 2013r . probably 190 zł . W 10 . 2014 . passed the calibration , after 23 blows from the calibration alco-test started to indicate 0 , 2 , 0 , 65 , 0 , 45 pr . although for a week there was not even beer. Sent in 02 . 2015 . to the seller turns out to be a fallen sensor, which costs another over 100 PLN . So the maintenance of the device for 2 years is: 2xcalibration + sensor to be exchanged with the parcels = 300PLN. Grandparents ! ! ! !"
1863,"First of all : five stars is definitely not enough ! Before I got 'em to the Doctor, for a year he had been looking for the cause of my walking problems - he had come a long way, visited a lot of different doctors, did a lot of tests and didn't get 'em any explanation for my problems. Two specialists suggested neurosis, but it was particularly difficult for me to decide to see a psychiatrist. The Doctor found 'em by coincidence, when I had to look for help from a psychiatrist quickly, forced by the increasing symptoms. By coincidence, because on the day when I decided to go to the psychiatrist, the Doctor had a free date. He gathered up em and went to 'em. My fears and anxieties disappeared as soon as I entered the office. The Doctor is a warm, kind and cordial person, trustworthy from the first moments on. She is full of empathy, care, she knows how to listen to the patient patient patiently and how to direct the conversation properly, so that she can recognize the problem comprehensively and thoroughly. The doctor persuaded me to start the pharmacological treatment, which I was very afraid of (I had bad experiences with medicines prescribed by another specialist). She allayed my fears by giving me her phone number and encouraging me to contact her if I felt bad after medication. She also set the days on which I was to report on the course of treatment. For a person with nervous problems it is a great support. She also directed me to psychotherapy, giving me directions to a very good psychotherapist. Now, after a dozen or so months of treatment (and psychotherapy), she has finished my treatment with the Doctor. The first time I came to the office was barely holding on to my feet. In the last vacation, I walked 'em in the mountains. The Doctor is a doctor by vocation and a wonderful man. I recommend it sincerely with all my heart! And Mrs. Magda, thank you very much !"
1864,"I recommend Jawor Holiday House, I had the opportunity to spend 4 days there with my family. Rooms freshly renovated, extra pillows, blanket, clean bathroom available. Especially the very nice staff, always helpful and delicious breakfast (very good scrambled eggs). Overall, the stay was very successful."
1865,"Great location, access to the fair is 10 minutes. The hotel is clean, good breakfasts, they could only work on WI FI in the evenings does not go, you have to go down to the bar there is not overloaded. There is parking both underground and next to the hotel. You can say good hotel for a good price."
1866,"The hotel is located in a quiet and peaceful place, about 50 km from Krakow (not all chains have a range - which can be both advantage and disadvantage:) Hotel service - professional, nice and helpful, treatments in the SPA (had us bought in a package) excellent, meals - varied and tasty. In a word - I highly recommend! The only disadvantage of the whole stay is the weather - it rained and we could not see the area: ( ."
1867,"Mrs. Julia is outstanding! I had the opportunity to take part in voice emission workshops, which she led, and I learned so much from them that even at work these changes were noticed, for the better of course. I'm impressed by how skillfully and quickly she was able to break through the resistance that was somehow inside me and took part in the exercises with commitment and with the great fun that these activities give. I think that everyone should try it once and see how much you can change in the way you speak. I estimate it at five stars, but it would give m and ten!"
1869,"The best results - according to the experience of the Japanese neurosurgeon professor Isao Morita - are achieved in patients after head trauma. Weaker results are achieved in patients after hypoxia due to suicide attempts or cardiac arrest . That is why we are looking for patients after brain injuries - explained Dr Barczewska earlier . In the opinion of physicians, the sphere of emotional reaction to the environment has improved in all operated persons, e.g. one of the operated persons was scared of a group of people in white aprons, on which they did not react at all before. Close relatives of the operated on observe also other fleeting reactions to the environment, e.g. to the presence of parents. Previously these people did not show any emotional reaction."
1870,"was in this hotel in August 2014 together with my daughter, the room is a terrible burrow, dirt and shit, the railing on the balcony torn off, by inattention you could fall down and kill yourself, / room at the height of the 2nd floor /, at the reception no one spoke English or German, the official language is Russian or Turkish, animators except for one / Cihan / it's gbury who do not even speak ""good morning"". No air-conditioning in the reception except something that was supposed to be an air conditioner but it really wasn't, old busted sofas with holes, fans in the canteen not always turned on, I don't recommend this place, there is nothing around, you have to go ok. 40 minutes dolmuszem to Fethiye, which being adapted for eg. 12 people takes 20, service at the hotel ok . although not all, everywhere Russians or Englishmen who are treated exceptionally, Poles in general, in one of the restaurants between the tables walk chickens, the cleaning lady does not speak any language only Turkish, offended that she has to clean, additionally steals from the mini bar water for which you have to pay, avoid this hotel from far away! ! ! ! !"
1871,"Once again, I will probably repeat myself, but I can afford to choose and realize my own preferences (close to history, past), so that in situations where there is a place on the way of my journey, on the way of my route, resembling a castle / past, it is there that indicates the place of stay. It was no different with the choice of Hotel Pałacyk . Nothing to accuse. The expectations were fully met. Greetings to the owners and staff. I recommend ."
1872,"I think he's a good doctor. I have been treating for years for arterial hypertension and pregnancy has been a threat to me and the baby from the beginning. From the beginning it was also under good care of me. When at the end of the pregnancy my blood pressure could not be normalised, he took me to the ward immediately. He often visited me and asked if I needed something. For the sake of my and the baby's safety, she gave birth to me one month earlier - by a C-section. I have no words of appreciation for the birth itself. Nice atmosphere in the operating room, no complications, the only doctor for this type of birth. She has heard a lot of positive opinions about the cesarean. I can also confirm this opinion myself 100%."
1873,"Very efficient service . The room is clean, the bathroom too. There was a hairdryer in the room, but there was no set to make yourself a coffee or tea. The daily cleaning, no problem. Quite a poor breakfast range. Location of the hotel a bit on the sidelines, but it is worth using the taxis ordered at the reception - very cheap: a trip of three kilometers about. 5 RON ."
1874,"There is a mushroom in the bathroom, ants in the kitchen, the temperature of water in the shower jumps. To the sea is 3 km. Breakfast is coffee and cake 3cm. Water in the pool is colder than in the sea. The beds are terribly hard and uncomfortable.Nobody informed us that you have to leave a deposit of 50 euro at check-in. Wifi is ok if someone can lie on the ceiling because only there was a range. Besides, nice service and nice views . It's a shame to destroy my hands to talk about the airlines ."
1875,": very nice and relaxed spent my birthday weekend with my kids. Breakfasts with a rich menu, with a special ""nod"" to the children. I consider the playground to fully satisfy the needs of children. a decent pool area allowed each of my three of them to find something interesting. Of course, the river was a hickory and for me the saunas were steam and dry. a pleasant corner near the reception desk allowing you to read newspapers / books / children's equipment also / and billiards - fun also for children."
1876,"I came to see Mr. Marcin privately because she would have to wait for a few months in the clinic. I have been suffering from lumbar spine pain for a long time. It is hard for me to bend down, sitting makes me uncomfortable and I have office work, so I have to recover quickly. The doctor recommended daily treatments and Mr. Marcin disagreed with this and suggested 1 - 2 times a week. I do not know who to believe and what to do."
1877,"I definitely don't recommend it. I'm very disappointed. For this price I did not expect miracles, but the kitchen is actually very different from the pictures. The whole construction barely holds on, the door from the oven opens with force and when it is opened it falls out of the mount. The back of the toy is made of cardboard, which barely holds on - rubbish. The shelves in the fridge door cannot be mounted (not properly fitted) and fall out all the time. The toy is not worth its price. The only advantage is the number of accessories, which have not been fully thought through (e.g. an egg is the size of a pot)."
1878,"I've been sick for a very long time. For many years I have been feeling constant pain, sometimes very strong on both shoulders. I am a young person, I am 30 years old and such ailments have basically taken away my joy of life. I have been with many specialists with different results, but the improvement never lasted too long. Diagnosis hmm, what doctor is different. She was really desperate and it was hard for me to believe anything else. She was looking for m already a miracle worker than a doctor, drowning razors get grabbed. She found out about Mr. Ark from a colleague. He made his initial diagnosis only after a week of tests and trial treatment, something like that happened to me for the first time. It wasn't easy for me to say that, but the relief lasted longer and the pain was less and less. Now the pain is almost gone, only with very violent movements, I can sleep, work and exercise. Mr. Arek is a real specialist, but he uses very different methods than the standard ones, but they are extremely effective. I highly recommend it. . . . . . . . . . . . ."
1880,"She went to therapy, looking for help, because she didn't see any sense in anything. I was lonely and desperate. I didn't think there was anything left for me. She didn't believe me at first in the effectiveness of such meetings. ""What can talking to a stranger do? ""- she thought. And yet... Turns out psychotherapy really heals. The hours we spent in Ola's office were not easy, but it made me different today. She built me a successful relationship, arranged my life and I feel fulfilled. I owe the fact that I'm here to a great extent to my Therapist. Thank you Alexandra for your warmth, patience and wisdom. You are the right person in the right place. Aga"
1881,"The hotel is relatively well located in relation to the city center (can be reached on foot in 10 - 15 minutes), in the vicinity of the hotel there is only a gas station. When entering the hotel you may be mistaken and enter a guarded private car park (the first barrier on the right), but I recommend to do it because a day there costs 18 PLN while in the hotel guarded car park 50 PLN and 20 PLN on unguarded. The standard room that we received was medium sized, well equipped (minibar, safe, extra blanket, tea/coffee set, extra pillows) unfortunately, quite long and until we asked for refreshment, sometimes dirty walls, literally black curtains, wiped old carpet, old TV set. The bathrooms are small, fairly clean, fluffy, fresh towels, spoiled effect cracked tiles in the shower. Really very comfortable beds you can get a great night's sleep, although there is a bit of noise from a busy crossroads, but in the end it's the city centre. The hotel staff at both the reception and the breakfast room are friendly, courteous and helpful. Breakfast is very good, fresh products and a large selection of dishes, only scrambled eggs were missing. The hotel clearly needs money to renovate and then it would be a great 4 star hotel. Nowadays it's pretty good as a stopover although I think the competition, has rooms of much better quality at a similar price."
1882,"She has lived in the hotel since 01 . 09 . 11 to 8 . 09 . 11, these were holidays organized by one of the leading Polish travel agencies . Perhaps if she had gone with another e.g. German agency the opinion would have been much better . Generally, the hotel was quite old and heavily used . It occupied my room on the first floor. Now I know that in this hotel you have to fight for higher floors. There are guests from Western Europe. On the lower floors the standard is lower. The bathroom stinks, the towels are wiped (exchanged daily), the room is cleaned, but only generally, as it is said after the heads. Food, well I didn't come there to eat. . . . As long as there were German and French groups ( first 4 days ) it was definitely better ! ! ! ! The advantage was the proximity of the beach. The beach itself is quite dirty and narrow. A tiny town, pretty. Close to Dubrovnik (very good connections) . Quite far from the market to buy water and, for example, fruit, which the hotel did not spoil. To sum up: it rested, got a tan, but for sure I will never go there again."
1884,"Ladies and gentlemen, we spent New Year's Eve in this special place and we can only wish to avoid it from a distance. The rooms were not heated - the temperature was ok. 16 C and it was difficult to get out of under the brackets Quality of the basement served for the New Year's Eve dinner rather ""rubber"" prices b. high Drunk waiters, and the reception staff hiding behind complaints from customers. To this yet the New Years Party, for which the deletion was ok. 800 pln (room price), and it did not take place at all. What is more, we advise you to watch out for this place in winter. In summer it is probably a bit different atmosphere."
1885,"At the beginning I would like to explain that I only evaluate the hotel's training space, i.e. the rooms and the hotel restaurant which was closed to other guests for the duration of the training. . Although I like the facility very much and it is beautifully situated and solidly finished gave me only two points because : . At the beginning of the training, the room was not prepared properly, the projector does not work properly while releasing the slides, the light ""was flashing"" . The bizarre thing was that one of the products advertised at this training has a pink box and this is extremely important because it is addressed to women and this pink is a distinguishing feature against the competition at the presentation on the projector the box was displayed as blue ! this was an anti-advertising product. After the training, it is customary for the company to invite you for a treat here was a dinner and a coffee cake . The time of waiting for your turn was very long . I waited over half an hour for my meal . The others who were first in line had a second course of soup and were coming up for coffee and sweets (this assortment was fortunately served in another place. When they consumed their meal, there was no dough and they had to wait for the dough in turn. When it comes to organizing mass events, chaos is one big failure."
1886,"Opinion on the basis of the coursework I - Exercise - At the faculty : IŚ Way of conducting classes : absurd Is it able to teach ? Nooooooooe Basis of assessment in the classroom / credits: 2 colloquia Unexpected: no sense of humour, that he has a general approach to the student: hard to judge, complicated personality General assessment: 2 ( 1 - 5 ) Mr. Marek is a real model, in class he does (rewrites) tasks that have nothing to do with the colloquia, it is difficult to find out about the results of the colloquia, sometimes you have to call home ; ) general chaos and mess (in one hand a pen, in the other a sponge), most of the time he spends on silly talking, worth recommending only to people who are able to learn everything by themselves and like to laugh, otherwise I advise against any contact, you can go crazy yourself."
1887,"This lens is designed for people who are just starting to take pictures with Canon DSLRs. It is a lens without image stabilization (it is in the newer Mark III model). The price of this lens is not exorbitant. You can already buy it in very good condition for about 160 - 190 PLN, which is a funny money for a lens. For a beginner photographer it will be a good choice to get acquainted with the possibilities of his own equipment, if he does not want to lecture big sums for the lens at the beginning. This equipment can take good pictures, but it requires a little practice and knowledge of the camera we use. I recommend it mainly to beginners. More advanced users should look for other lenses."
1888,"My father was treated for a very long time for depression. He visited several specialists. Unfortunately, nothing helped, no drugs. Since spring, he was lying in bed, in summer he didn't leave his room at all, he didn't sleep at night, he didn't have any desire to live or any strength for anything! One day my brother got additionally ill - he started to talk from things, to have productive symptoms, we were all in shock! In the evening it was already very bad with him! In the newspaper we read the advertisement ""Psychosoma"" - Dr. Zolkoś received us on the same day. I was with them on a visit - he made a good impression on me: competent and such turned out to be. My brother prescribed effective medication - he fell asleep calmly, in the morning he woke up much calmer and had no more delusions or delusions. He started to improve his father's condition after just about. 2 weeks. - He started to get up, then go out to people, to the shop, think about work, about the future (until now he functioned like a withering plant and we couldn't do anything; 2 years earlier he had his first episode of depression, then everything changed to come back with double the force - only Dr. Zolkoś made a correct diagnosis that it was not depression but a bipolar affective disorder: manic-depressive). At the moment it is 1 or 5 years since both of them are treated with the doctor. The brother functions normally: he works, there are no symptoms of this terrible disease. The father is similar - since he has been treated with the doctor, his condition is stable (he has only slight mood swings) and functions quite normally. It is true that monthly visits cost a lot, but thanks to them my father and brother live like people. Before, my father used to spend a lot on drugs that didn't help anything! It's also true that Dr. asked several times for prescription drugs for himself - which is a little strange, but you can always refuse. . . Once it happened that he wasn't there, he canceled the visit a few times because of illness, stay in hospital (in general he has health problems - after all, he is also a human being). We will see how it goes on. So far we are very grateful to him for his help and effective treatment. We are afraid to risk changing the doctor who will be cheaper but ineffective. Aneta"
1889,"very good location, close to the main train station. Not far from a great pub, where you can drink beer and eat a delicious sorbet dessert for a little money. The hotel's staff is helpful, you can do the laundry on the spot, you'll get along in English. The only downside to our room is the squeaky bed, but maybe it's an isolated case."
1890,"In their work on the ReligaHeart EXT dentures, the researchers used their experience with a similar system for adults (POLCAS system), which has already been successfully used in over 340 patients. In March, in the Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, a heart transplantation was successfully performed in a patient who had previously been supported with these prostheses for a record time of over 500 days. As emphasized by the designers, the new extracorporeal dentures ReligaHeart EXT use the latest design and technological achievements developed over the last decade: a new generation of biocompatible polyurethane with extended durability in long-term blood contact and a microprocessor system for remote communication of the denture controller, which allows observation of its work during the patient's stay outside the hospital."
1891,"This facility is not even a hotel, although it uses the name of the hotel. Nowadays managed by a trustee and as a result terribly neglected, dirty, everything falls apart. . . Inside it smells musty, to the pool / jacuzzi the fear of entering. Massacre, I do not recommend."
1892,"Unfortunately: (Once again, I am forced to share with you a poor opinion about the hotel, because of the ""poorly trained service""? ? ? / staff. . . . Because 5 * he's committed! ! ! During our last stay, we came across an arrogant, dislikeable receptionist, who does not comply with the standard of the Piast Hotel: (After another - ordered by the "" hotels.com "" portal, room 2 + 1, turned out to be a double room - the extra bed reserved for a child was not included. . . However, the worst thing is that when you check in, instead of pre-authorizing a credit card for possible additional expenses in the hotel, you have blocked the ""upstairs"" on our card amount of 200 pln. . . . The previous time we experienced this 12 years ago . . . For the above reasons - I do not recommend visiting the hotel: ( Unfortunately!"
1893,"We chose to stay from Sunday to Monday: half the price. And all the luck, because it's too expensive anyway. The decor is a thing of taste, for me - kitsch. At the beginning it turned out that the restaurant is open from 7. 15 . We had to leave earlier, so the lady at the reception desk recommended talking about lunch boxes in the restaurant. The price included a romantic dinner. The restaurant is only in the thermal baths. The atmosphere of the bar with a huge TV set (the sauna guests were very popular). Romance - 0 . My fried potatoes with garlic sauce cost 22 zl (dinner was in the package) . Price from outer space. In the restaurant we asked for lunch boxes - no chance, because you no longer had bread. It's not possible and our problem is not. To the sauna I suggest you take your own slippers. Those offered by the hotel are material and just slippery. The saunas are fine, the treatments offered too. When we return to the hotel, we've reported problems with breakfast. The lady took to the news (without emotion) and smoothly proceeded to pay for the water drunk in the sauna. Only after paying attention she began to wonder what to do with the problem. As a result we got some toasted bread sandwiches, some fruit and yogurt. The general impressions of the stay were fatal (except for the sauna itself). We're not going back there for sure. Considering that apart from our car there was only one more car in the parking lot, the suicidal guests' well-being."
1894,"I have had astigmatism for many years. My treatment so far has consisted of regularly replacing my glasses with more and more powerful ones. In the summer of this year, I was persuaded by a friend of mine to visit Dr. Gołębiowski and suggested something else - a laser treatment. He was a little afraid of them, but in the end I am very satisfied with the effect. Eventually, I was able to get back to my old sporting activity, where my glasses were disturbing me."
1895,"Course : basics of mathematical analysis ( lecture ) Evaluation : I recommend : ) [ / b ] Mr. Dr. is a screw-up, but at least you can't get bored during the lecture ; ) Everything is explained in the simplest way possible, supported by examples """
1896,"The hotel fully deserves 4 stars. The rooms are very clean, professional service and very nice. Very good and hearty breakfast. Various opinions circulate on Internet forums about dinner at this hotel. I am a professional chef and with a clear conscience I recommend them. Fish, meat, local cuisine, daily something different. And for dessert cakes baked on site, a revelation. Very well maintained and extensive recreational infrastructure, headed by swimming pools. The hotel is quite large so you have to go to some of the rooms a little bit but after the Byzantine meals it is even advisable. To the center 20 minutes . walk and on the way shepherd's hut and still warm "" redykołki "" straight from the smokehouse . I recommend"
1897,"Hello, I decided to write 'em about this doctor so that others would think about it before they go to him. The doctor removed my thyroid in May 2013 (in Wieliszew - he is the chief there). Immediately after the operation he wanted to discharge me home, he told me to pack up and only the nurse asked me if I had a tingling sensation in my fingers or on my face he told 'em that I have (he thought 'em that it's normal after the operation) he just got scared and immediately ordered a test, attention - he stayed in the hospital for another week (he took 'em orally and in the form of a drip - 3 times a day!) because it turned out that I have hypocalcemia! ! ! It's first of all, secondly, after the operation I had a squeaky (moaning) voice and I quickly got tired of a few sentences, and he says, well, a lovely voice, after all, what do you mean, but it's been 1 or 5 months since the operation and I still had one, so I went to phoniatrics (medicine. Wakarow - I highly recommend it) and she said why I am only now coming (I had a one-sided paralysis of something in my throat), she prescribed me injections and iontophoresis (for 1 or 5 months), and why? because my lord Count Doctor told me not to read the Internet and after all what I want, when I am just after the surgery. Sum of the sum total I advise against this surgeon ! ! ! He's rude, he knows best and that's it. If it wasn't for the fact that I have my own mind and yet I have consulted me from the Internet, my voice would not come back. I'm writing an opinion so that others can think about it before they go to that doctor. I ADVISE AGAINST IT! ! ! ! ! !"
1898,"I'm not really judging the doctor very well. At the first visit the doctor seemed to me very professional, so I made an appointment for my son for the second visit to the head. The doctor did the service, and because my son has been suffering from a few days of diarrhea, I also asked for a medical consultation. My son is only breastfed and suspected a food allergy that could cause diarrhea. The doctor prescribed 4 drugs to the child when she asked me what they were for and why as many as 4, I heard that I could reduce the amount of drugs by half and even by 70%. I asked him to explain to me what the drugs are for and what are for diarrhea - in response she heard that these are not drugs but probiotics. When I asked why as many as 4 doctors answered that he was recommending so much and if I didn't like it I could no longer come and consult the child with another doctor. On the outsider threw that we were only contracted for an ultrasound and there was no time to explain anything to me. I will add that for the visit he has collected the money, except of course the salary for the headaches."
1899,"In April 2010. Morgan Stanley decided to stop construction of the facility and was determined to sell the $932 million worth of the investment. In order to revive tourism in Atlantic City, New Jersey's governor Chris Christie announced in February 2011 that he would invest $260 million in the suspended project in exchange for 20% of revenues. The state aid and a bond issue for the construction of the project resulted in a package of $1.15 billion to complete the project. In practice, the implementation of this project is an example of a kind of ""American"" public-private partnership. Located in the state of New Jersey, Atlantic City is a well-known swimming pool, promenade and gambling center on the east coast of the USA."
1900,"I spent 5 days in this hotel with my disabled daughter. My stay cost me almost 5 thousand zlotys. A few hours after the departure I was called from the hotel that once again the staff checked my room and they were missing two candy bars in the minibar. I was surprised but she apologized to the lady and told me that I will immediately transfer these few zlotys to the hotel account. Then the lady said that she was still missing a European bison. She was shocked. She took out a candy bar if I did not see it, although it is unlikely because her daughter does not eat such a candy bar, but a bison soup? ? ? ? . You told me that I think it's an exaggeration, if I didn't drink this bison bar because I think my daughter would have known about it. Then you said you'd check again. The next day she called me, that the European bison was found, only two candy bars are missing and this time a coke. They had enough time to count me when checking out, after all she did not run away with me. When I checked out, everything was fine. I was scared of what the woman would come up with in a moment and she immediately transferred these few zlotys to my hotel account. However, the distaste and humiliation remained. How can you take from a customer a few thousand for 5 days stay and call him later as a thief to give away for a candy bar which probably costs them a zloty in wholesale. I will never go there again and I don't recommend it. For such money she could spend her holidays in any other place in the world without offending me."
1901,"German A 2 / E I recommend, even your M.A. is doing a lot to get students to pass the exam: ) He's trying to do all the right things and not to bother people with the wrong ones."
1902,"A very welcome welcome at the reception. Hotel run by a family business (grandmother, grandfather, children, uncles, grandchildren). All guests are served directly (reception, waiters, service and bicycle trips). Hotel for fans of bicycle tours, but not only - everyone will find something for themselves. Daily organized bicycle tours around the picturesque surroundings for the more and less advanced. The possibility of renting bikes on site as well as all the information about the hiking and biking trails - comprehensive information in English, German, Italian. Nice outdoor swimming pool, crawlers by the pool, sunny place. Nice hotel garden with a pond, lots of exotic vegetation around the building. Parking outside and underground in the price of the stay. Spa area: indoor swimming pool open all day long. 08 - 20 , saunas from 16 - this one, massage. Part of the pool with warmer and another with cooler water. Sun loungers, towels, bathrobes are available to guests at no extra charge. A cool restaurant with several rooms, stylish for the region. Very good card meals and dinners: strong Italian and Tyrolean accents. Super antipasti: very large number of vegetables and seafood in various forms in small portions, so that you can try a lot. Dinner in g . 19 - 21 . Breakfast is varied - without splendour but everyone will find something for themselves. Fresh products, choice of fresh fruit, drinks - regional cheese and wedges. Weak coffee - you have to order a better restaurant for a fee. Rooms with a view of the mountains, surroundings, with a balcony. We had a 2 level room: downstairs table, sofa, TV, upstairs big marital bed, TV, wardrobe in the building. Functional bathroom with shower, bidet, plenty of space, cosmetics field, etc. A small fridge in the room was enough for us: there are large mineral water bottles. There are shortages: - no possibility of using the washing machine even for a fee - a kettle in the room would be useful - I do not know if the iron and board can be lent on the spotvery successful stay and we will certainly benefit in the future"
1903,"I was hoping that a visit to the Medicover centre would look different than the ones described on this portal. . . . visit lasted 3 minutes, 2 of which took Dr. Mamach to write a prescription. Even before he could say anything, the doctor knew what he was going to prescribe - he had not even seen all the results yet. To my question about an additional blood test he answered ""yes, you are afraid because these are pills for life, yes, yes"" - not interrupting the prescription. Dr. Mamach's ""treatment"" is about prescribing, not finding the cause of the disease."
1904,"The hotel seems to be luxurious and of a high standard. But these are only appearances. First of all, rooms: I got a room in the old part. The room and the bathroom need to be renovated. In the room there was an intense smell of chemicals used to clean the carpet. Because of the small children who were with me, it made me feel uneasy. Changing the room was not an option because the hotel was supposedly full. Ventilation didn't help. In addition, the bed covers were unfortunately terribly dirty. . . Visible stains of unknown origin. . . It was truly disgusting. The bathroom, unfortunately, was also in poor condition. . . The shower wasn't cleaned, the mixer in the washbasin was old with stone barely working. And unfortunately the rooms in the old part lack air conditioning: - ( . Second service: at the reception desk, unfortunately, in my opinion, with full occupancy of the hotel was not enough employees. Arrangement of anything was connected with standing back in a long queue. Restaurant staff is a bit ""sleeping"". To sum up, I was disappointed because I was hoping that the stay in this hotel will be really on a high level. Unfortunately, there is a lot to improve in it."
1905,"The hotel is the peak of kitsch and rubbish. Everything must be big and gold. Golden handles, golden air vents, golden sconces with plastic crystals. The only thing missing is a gold TV - they have something to work on. Such Polish October, cheap materials but richly. Lack of taste . A terrible crowd in the hotel. The air-conditioning is practically lacking, when I arrived in the room was 32 degrees, after closing the windows and turning on the air conditioning, the temperature rose to an impossible 33, 5 degrees. Pool used up . In the saunas, the planks and floor so hot that you can't enter first, sitting down steaming through a towel and swimming trunks. You have to go out in the jumps of the scratching, you can not stop on the hot tiles. Next to the saunas there is a small pool to cool down with cool water, where at the top there are 4 kitchen pots to which water is poured and after a while poured out, independent whether you want it or not. Besides, at 9 pm the complex is closed. And now I'm going to the worst - the food. I don't remember a hotel with such heavy, tasteless and indigestible food. All fried, stinking of fat. It was supposed to pretend to be rich here too. All my energy went to the digestion. I was sick for a long time. I felt like I was in the Polish People's Republic, in a hotel for foreigners. Something between the Orbis Hotel and the Bunch. It's hard to communicate with the staff - they don't speak Polish. The hotel looks best from a distance, you can see cheap materials and wear. I advise against it."
1906,"I was in a hurry, the white shirt - a gift from my wife - was on the bed. I realized in 3 hours at the highway parking lot. I call the reception desk - I agree with you to send it at my expense (charge the card). I wait 3 days and call - they have no order! ! ! I write an e-mail to leave a trace - no answer. This is a scandal ! I have not met with such service in other hotels. No communication ! ! ! Targeted on one - night clients ! I won't go back there and advise others against it."
1907,"I advise against the Doctor. She got to her by accident, then she started reading her very clever books. She writes in them that the most important thing is contact with the patient and conversation. Unfortunately, in practice it looks completely different. She led me to my pregnancy and visits to her were instantaneous, sometimes she did not even examine me! Later at the birth she had a problem because she didn't fill in my pregnancy booklet and the doctors said that I (!) neglected my pregnancy because she didn't go to the doctor from the beginning. Generally I recommend her books but I strongly advise against visiting her! ! ! !"
1908,"It's my second headphones from this manufacturer the previous SE 390 model was in close contact with the ground and was only suitable for the basket, I had to run and buy new ones I came across just these, the specification of these headphones to me spoke a little bit to read em about them on foreign sites people were happy with them they ordered it and you know what I'm going to tell you are not sorry they are worth their precious sound that flows from them will satisfy the most picky, The vocal is so clean it feels like a concert in the front row, the rest of the band is just as balanced nothing gets out in the background bass is pleasant not any rumble there as in AKG. The only thing you can attach to the cable is thin you have to be very careful of it. . . Besides the same advantages, in combination with a DAC card you can move to another dimension."
1909,"She got a severe bleeding in 8 weeks of pregnancy. Despite the constant bleeding, the doctor examined me very painfully, with no delicacy or feeling. In addition, he mismeasured the size of the embryo, determined the age of pregnancy at 7 weeks 4 days even though the examination on the second day at another doctor indicated 8 weeks 5 days. Despite the fact that the blood was pouring out of me with the planes on the card he noted ""scanty bleeding"". In the end he refused any treatment saying that such pregnancies are not sustained. Very severe and dry, no empathy."
1910,"The hotel stands out from the local restaurant with its knightly feast. Tasty dishes served by manors and squires are long remembered by knights and warriors. After dinner it is worthwhile to visit the swimming pool - although it is tiny, it blends in beautifully with the castle cellars. The rooms are unfortunately a misunderstanding. In the ""family cell"". After inserting the cot, there was no more room to put the suitcase, let alone move freely. Old and dusty equipment, the bathroom is only worn out and needs to be renovated."
1911,"The visit started unfortunate for me, the doctor treated me like a hysteric, but after a thorough review of the documentation and the interview, the doctor showed great competence, corresponding to my expectations, i.e. he stated that I should be treated by a neurologist, (he asked for a consultation with the neurologist on . . . ) after obtaining a possible diagnosis, he asked to be informed about the outcome of the consultation. He excluded the need for orthopaedic treatment. I recommend a visit to the Professor ."
1912,"The hotel is reasonably well looked after. Spacious rooms . We were with a 10 month old child, but unfortunately the tourist cot that we got was a bit broken, but we could use it. Unfortunately, the location of the hotel was not very beneficial. The offer was that to the sea is 350 m and in fact it was almost 2 km. The hotel beach was to be reached by the hotel train, but unfortunately it was not open. You had to book a hotel car was not always available at the time you wanted. As for the food, it was varied only on weekends as there were many tourists. In the week as these tourists were less it was less choice of food. Unfortunately with part of the service was a problem with getting along in English."
1913,"The visit took place before the agreed time, so I did not have to wait. It lasted three minutes, the interview was none. It seems that the doctor did not even take a good look at the problem, did not ask about the products I use, did not assess the condition of the skin. The doctor wanted to prescribe me oral antibiotics for acne vulgaris, it seems to me that the antibiotic taken for 3 weeks is a last resort and not the first solution. I was finally prescribed a drug which she herself proposed to me. 3 minutes for £120. . . Disappointment. Maybe if m came with an ulcer face, she wouldn't have ignored me."
1914,"Rooms as for communism in WZW Kościelisko . But besides that, okay. Very nice service. A high-level restaurant . On-site ski rental . Directly at the hotel super black route (you need to get from your shoe about 100m) allowing you to get to Montolino without using the bus, which stands right next to the hotel."
1915,"You're very kind and warm, but terribly distracted. She asks several times for the same thing or changes her decision every few minutes, forgetting the previous one, which makes me uneasy. Besides, despite making an appointment for a specific time, you still have to reckon with at least 20 - 30 minutes of waiting in the waiting room."
1916,"The doctor is in the best position. However, it annoyed me that the visit was delayed for 30 minutes and I had the impression that it was very instrumental. The interview took her longer than just talking about the problem and he still heard 'em, that was 'em too long. She doesn't need to date so many patients because she just loses it."
1917,"In total, in 2015 Marriot wanted to have 6 hotels operating under the Edition brand. In October ub . r . Marriott signed an agreement to buy a Clock Tower office building near Madison Square Park in Manhattan in the first half of the 20th century, which is to house the New York Edition. According to Sorenson, further locations are being considered as : Abu Dhabi, Bangkok and Gurgaon in India and perhaps also in West Hollywood, California. In the opinion of the new president of the network Marriott, the luxury segment will be the long-term growth engine of the network, due to the dynamics of economic development, in countries such as China. The Edition is one of four life style / collections brands (the others are AC Hotels by Marriott, Autograph and Renaissance) in the Marriott International Group's 18 brand portfolio."
1918,"Super hotel. Very nice and helpful service . The rooms were clean, cleaned every day, as much as possible, the size was enough in the end we did not come to sit in the room, there is really nothing to attach to, the air conditioning worked quietly. The sea can be seen without any problems from the first floor, because the trees are not dense. The swimming pools next to the hotel are very cool - cleaned practically every morning, hot water (warmer than in the sea). The food is great - we have not managed to try everything for a week. We did not wait more than 5-10 minutes for drinks to dinner. The whole resort is sensational, very well managed. We didn't get bored with laughing there for a while. A little disappointed by the aquapark - not much of an attraction for us, but great is minigolf. I recommend hotel Niko. We will return there for sure."
1919,"Every 2 - 3 weeks, he makes cards which forces him to work systematically. B . explains well if you don't know something, ask for sure it will explain it to you. If it is about getting credit, follow him and he will give you. : )"
1920,"The hotel is getting worse every year. I often stay there on duty. The hotel is more dilapidated every year, the rooms need to be renovated. However, it has a very nice location by the lake. Recently it has been very noisy, neighbors and events for various companies. The food is very good in the form of a Swedish table. Beware of the access road to the hotel. I recently lost my tire on it and the hotel didn't give me any compensation because they said it belongs to the city. Very not a cool attitude to the customer. Although I'm going there again, I'd rather choose another hotel."
1921,"Marconi Spa is one of the few health resorts in Poland where you can cure your ailments, such as hip degeneration. In addition, the spa offers its clients a wide range of services, such as a wide range of massages and basic treatments, which bring people into a state of complete relaxation and tranquility while giving them vitality. You can also take advantage of other treatments. You will notice the great professionalism of medical service and commitment to your work. I sincerely recommend it! I will also mention the food, which is so tasty, and especially the dinners, where you can ""feel"" the taste of grandmother's childhood from years ago - Very Tasty. . . ps . Note: When using the salt pools, you should take off all kinds of jewelry. Especially with silver chains, rings, signets, etc. ) . Patients are of course informed in advance by the staff, but not everyone remembers this."
1923,"I know. I've been with him once. I don't know what to think about it all. A friend recommended it to me. At the entrance, I noticed a picture of the adhesions, laminated and heavily tarnished, and my intuition told me that I'm sure all patients are showing them. He showed me too. I have a 170-growth, I weigh 61 kg. She found out that I am obese, I have eternal mycosis, adhesions, chronic cystitis, cysts. . . I was in shock. She has never felt anything, no baking, no bourbon, no discharge. . . But the doctor didn't give me a word or a moment, he didn't even listen to me, he just knows better. He prescribed me suppositories and suppositories and globules and ointment and pills for this bladder infection. I don't know. I got to him after the pregnancy stopped. I was examined by 4 doctors in front of him and nobody said anything about these cases, and she bothered me all the questions why it happened. It seems to me that maybe not every one of them, but at least one of them would also detect the things that Mariusz told me about. I am in the dot. I don't know whether to go to him or someone else. . . So far, I'm following his instructions, but no, I don't go with the ""GOD"" and I can't sleep on my belly. My plan is to go again and see if there's any improvement."
1924,"I don't recommend it. Spa is a mockery, pool for 4 people. In the spa area you can only get some hors d'oeuvres. Stench on level 0. Terrible service. Fungus in the bathroom and in the room. Calling this spa facility is a fraud. I don't recommend it, I even advise against it."
1925,"He's a great man and a specialist. I immediately sensed that I was dealing with a professional. He was already with some famous sexologists and there were no effects. After a few visits to a sexologist Dr. Czeslaw Toboły, my sex life has taken on a glow, my partner is delighted. I will always remember this wonderful man and a great specialist . He is worth recommending . He is a man full of warmth, understanding and commitment to the patient. He was recommended to me by a friend of mine who also boasts of the effects he has achieved after visiting this specialist."
1926,"They chose a four-star hotel for a day's stay for our three-person family. I wanted our eight-month-old son to have good conditions (clean room, comfortable bed, kettle). From the beginning, however, we met an unpleasant surprise. Huge parking problems and lack of prepared rooms (12:30pm). We had to change the baby in the toilet on the counter at the washbasin and feed in the hall. Room in a very poor standard . Stained carpet, anointed wainscot, bathroom hair on the floor, old TV set. Generally not very clean. A bit like in a poor Italian hotel."
1927,"We spent 3 days in the Christmas period. On the Internet a loud Christmas Eve offer and more. Unfortunately, the hotel as for me has a top 3 stars, and I'm not sure. The food is cool, underdressed, the menu is noisy and really dry and on one hoof. Cakes old on the chips. Only the red borscht was really tasty. The cook is not one of the best. The room's fine, clean and uncluttered, the same goes for the area around. The waiters want to clean the plate from under their noses as soon as possible, your restaurant manager (I guess) comes up during the meal and says something about changing the place. For me it is a scandal. The first day of Christmas, according to the plan, dinner in the barbecue hut at 15 ( ! ) and then at 16:00 - this one up to 17:30 dinner in the restaurant. Hahaha , misunderstanding . In fact, there is an unpleasant smell in the bathrooms from the pipes. Huge plus for the opportunity to come with a pet . The surrounding area is wonderful and offers many opportunities to spend free time. Generally not the worst, but unfortunately there is no frenzy. Please do not expect fireworks, even if the descriptions on the internet promise pears on willow. The hotel stars are asking for a search. ps, there's a coffee in the conference hall of the coffee machine, interesting since when? ! ? The smell in this building speaks for itself, pfuj."
1928,"She bought me a product in zooplus, unfortunately apparently they have some kind of agreement with the Czech Republic because she gave me there a negative evaluation of several of the company's products and none of them were published (a few months ago, my other evaluations were published). Going back to the product itself. The food is very popular with cats but since a few years ago the RC company has been bought out by a whiskas company and the composition of the food is terribly poor quality. It is whiskas in a different package. It does not contain any meat at all, and the enigmatically named animal proteins, which are usually obtained e.g. from feathers, are extremely low quality proteins. What's even worse is that it is full of cereals and plant products (i.e. all waste). Cats are carnivores and this is what they should be fed. Why do cats like to eat it? Because it is full of chemical additives that improve the taste so that cats will touch it at all. It contains preservatives that are responsible for causing cancer. Remember that not everything that tastes healthy (we also eat chips. . . . ) . I would like to conclude by saying that my kitten has developed a strong allergy on this food (to cereals) and because of this (or maybe it is because of this that she found out what kind of junk food RC produces). She bought me a 10kg sack (she was hoping to save money), but unfortunately, I was only losing it."
1929,"Perhaps the novel the director was modeling himself on is brilliant - but this does not apply to the film. In my opinion this horror is the worst of all that she watched m - and she watched m many of them, because I am a fan of the genre . Terribly boring and monotonous, she waited impatiently for me to develop the action until the last minute and with disappointment she said that nothing happened that could have frightened me in the least. The protagonist behaves as if he were under the influence of some means, not like someone in a haunted room. Failure."
1930,"- Dinner in the restaurant at my own risk (it cost me 100zl and 3 days of stomach problems with fever) - the service denies any connection with their restaurant (unfortunately I ate only in your restaurant) I did not feel that anyone cares too much, Breakfast, of course, hasn't been touched - total lack of control over paid parking spaces resulting in blocking of the car by other parking cars - employees spread their hands and say that nothing can be done about it, well, the electronic system is only used to charge for as many cars as possible, regardless of the number of available parking spaces - tight room, dark room, no air conditioning, TV too small and suspended almost from the ceiling"
1931,"We expect Polish food to be healthy, rich in bio-ingredients and affordable. Scientists from research institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences are concentrating their efforts to ensure that the raw materials and products of animal origin produced in our country are the best. As part of the Bio-centre - animal, food and man project coordinated by the Institute of Genetics and Animal Breeding of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IGHZ), modern equipment has been purchased, which in the future will be used for complex research aimed at improving food quality. Researchers will also provide specialized services for companies from the agri-food sector. The director of IGHZ PAN, Prof . dr hab . Jarosław Horbańczuk ."
1932,"On the occasion of her wedding anniversary, she bought an accommodation package with breakfast and dinner available on the website. At the reception desk I was informed that it is enough to go to the restaurant to have dinner. In fact, it did not turn out to be that easy. The restaurant staff asked for a voucher for dinner from the reception desk. She informed me that we did not receive any, we have it in the package. The waiter said that everyone can talk to each other like that and that I should go to the reception to explain it to myself. An embarrassing situation. The husband was left alone at the table, he was not even offered anything to drink at that time, and I slime myself to explain to the reception. Why didn't the waiter go alone or call? I have no idea. The situation is probably normal in a hostel, but strange in a hotel of this class, making it unforgivable. It made me feel like an inferior client. The reception was nice enough to call the waiter and shout him out. But they didn't hear us even apologize. Neither the interior nor the view will compensate for our unpleasant experiences. A complaint written on the hotel's website impervious to moderation. Never again!"
1933,"A good hotel, in a good place, some small rooms but tastefully furnished. Continental breakfast / coffee could be better / . A small car park by the hotel. All typical Italian small hotel, but well maintained. And a great owner, helpful, helpful, helpful, helpful, you can negotiate a good price, knows how to encourage the customer."
1934,"The hotels of the National Tourist Cooperative Gromada in Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski ( 127 rooms ) and Przemysl ( 108 rooms ) have changed ownership. The group carrying out restructuring activities, the main part of which is the sale of unprofitable assets, including hotel properties and the audit of the location of facilities operating in the chain, sold the buildings to an entrepreneur operating in south-eastern Poland. Both facilities will be used to maintain hotel operations, however, OST Gromada will certainly operate the facilities until the end of Q1 2013. Whether the Cooperative will run the facilities in the future will be decided by talks ."
1935,"She spent the night with her family in a 4-person apartment. Both the room and the bathroom are very clean. Breakfast is very tasty and varied, all fresh. Beautifully served, the wonderful jam of rose, made personally by the owner - fingers to lick! ! ! The service is very nice and helpful. The interior is pleasant, atmospheric in the background discreet music, I will certainly return there. I sincerely recommend this place: )"
1936,"We bought orbrek with our wife almost 2 years ago. In the beginning we used it less often, now very regularly. For those who are looking for it, I recommend to go to the hardware store and get the most comfortable one for themselves. I wanted to buy a Rivo P because a friend recommended me and a super cool computer has. In the shop it turned out to be a little bit dumpy and this model is very stable and comfortable for my wife. It was much more expensive and with a simpler computer - which really does not matter for training. At the beginning I was in the way of my knees (I am 180cm tall) but standing straight fits me perfectly. For the big plus deserves a 3-year warranty door - to - door. Once the line from the load setting knob fell down and the service quickly removed the fault. Pulse measurement in my opinion does not work at all. Maybe with an ear clip it would be ok, but it is uncomfortable, so I use a chest strap and a POLAR M400 watch or a phone. The display only reads speed, distance and time. Sometimes the platforms on which you stand squeak a bit and I couldn't remove it by tightening the screws, the rest is very quiet. You can practice the movie at night when the kids are sleeping."
1937,"We were disappointed. A large hotel where a lot of people stay during the season and this is unfortunately visible everywhere, especially during meals or at the pool. The hotel also has the function of a ""city swimming pool"". because in the main hall there are huge queues of people (not hotel guests) waiting to enter the pool. The parking lot is accessible by whole coaches with excursions. You can imagine what is happening at the swimming pools or in the sauna. We have shortened our stay because, unfortunately, during the season the hotel is not able to provide a peaceful holiday. It can be seen that the hotel needs renovating, especially the part with swimming pools. The rooms themselves are quite comfortable and large."
1938,"Dr. Kornelia Tomaszewska met me last year, while I was weaning contraceptive hormones and preparing my body for pregnancy. After thorough research on the functioning of the hormonal economy, where problems with too high a level of testosterone were found and thus a bad omen for an imminent pregnancy, she led the body ""on the straight"" by prescribing drugs. Unfortunately, despite the requests, hormone tests were not repeated after the treatment, because the doctor stated that there is no need for it. This is the first downside I give her: the certainty that why her therapy shouldn't work, when too high testosterone is a book case. She continued my treatment with the doctor. What convinced me at the beginning is that at the beginning she really listens, tries to ask the patient about everything, answers all the questions (expressing her medical judgement), focuses on the results of the tests. This has its good points, which, as she said, I appreciate. What she lacks is a particle of humanity, a vocation to the medical profession, the ability to talk to people, empathy, the ability to feel yourself in the situation of the patient and above all to treat each case as a separate one! ! The doctor looks at her in general and through the prism of book cases, she personally felt at her examination like on a production line. One, two, three and another. . . The doctor was leading my pregnancy to 15 weeks. She wouldn't let her keep me pregnant for any longer, because she would have led me to a new miscarriage. As in the previous case, the doctor, not having her ""own"" ultrasound equipment with her, did not advise to check the whole chorion (2 weeks before the visit she landed me in the hospital with a hemorrhage) and sent me back with a receipt, inviting me next month. At the same time she said that from the medical point of view everything is ok, so they get fired only at her request, because if she could get back to work. . . I'll add that the pregnancy is in danger, I'm getting asshosted for support, recommendations, lying down, no physical activity, no lifting, etc. Dear doctor, if you sometimes look at the forum where you can learn a lot about your treatment from the perspective of your patients, please take into account that every pregnant woman needs to feel properly and not cursed. Nothing will happen if you spend more than 5 minutes on your patient's visit. Maybe you will even save some small existence."
1939,"No malice, but certainly not 5 * . Simple things: no bottled water in the rooms, no kettle, no WI - FI in the rooms (very poor internet coverage of LTE forget about it), very narrow balconies and what's the worst in all drinks from vending machines, in ice and water served to meals taste CHLOR! In my opinion these are the most important disadvantages of the hotel. Besides, there is nothing to complain about."
1940,"The study of the relationship between methylation and age can, according to prof . Płoski - application not only in forensic science but also in health assessment. ""There are already studies which indicate that people whose methylation looks like it does in slightly older people actually die at a slightly younger age. So these people are kind of biologically older than their metric age would indicate,"" the scientist points out. However, he admits that it is still unknown whether the state of methylation - and with it also the biological age - can be reversed or at least stopped, e.g. by changing the lifestyle. This is what Prof . The rumours of the future in his research are to be addressed. DNA methylation - as prof . Rumours are the basic mechanism of gene regulation. It takes place under the influence of the environment and is not inherited, however, it has a significant impact on the functioning of an individual. ""Methylation can mimic the mutation in some way - it can turn the gene off or activate it. Moreover, it seems - and this is the view now dominant - that methylation may be responsible for differences in susceptibility to diseases that are not genetic - such as ... hypertension, mental illnesses, overweight or allergies"" - says a researcher from WUM ."
1941,"How can the splendor of the hotel, the effort of other people be lost through the splendid, unsympathetic, obcessive receptionist? . The other receptionists were OK. There were em exactly 24 April 2018 late afternoon hours (extremely naughty lady), and left em exactly 27 . 04 . 2018 in the morning - the same receptionist, the same bulky face and pretentious (but not excused) behavior. Pity . . . big loss of image and classic anti-advertising ."
1942,"I was only at the consultation with Dr. Tesinski, so I cannot comment on the effects of the operation, but as for the behavior of the doctor at the consultation visit I cannot agree with your assessments. She consulted me on the abdominal plasticity. The doctor didn't ""float me off"" at all. On the contrary. He thoroughly evaluated the situation, explained everything to me, described the whole procedure. The visit didn't last 5 minutes, only half an hour, but even if it lasted 5 minutes, it seems to me that it's not about the duration of the visit, but to find out everything and to have the doctor assess the situation well. Apparently he has so much experience that he does not need to spend the whole day with the patient. Greetings."
1943,"I've had three semesters of basketball every time with someone else. At Gryszko's it's like this: you warm yourself up (throws, etc.) and then split into 3 teams and play up to 6 points and change, as there are fewer people it's a long game. In my opinion these 6 minutes are not enough. Sometimes it happened that it was divided into 4 teams and we played streetball for 2 baskets, the winners could leave once without consequences. To get a bdb you could have 1 missed (he doesn't say that, only when you give marks). The atmosphere is very good, the leader doesn't go anywhere during the class, he only referees all the time, he will even tell you how effective the free kicks the team had;). ), from time to time, he will take someone for a selfish game (and very well). You can really play but on condition that you play longer than 6 points."
1944,"""One of the elements will be a narrow, small apartment, like many in Polish cities. All this is so that rescuers who are learning the profession can enter and, for example, practice transferring patients, phantoms of natural weight, in stretchers, pulled out of the narrow tub, which will also be there"" - he explained . ""Rescue workers - students will have to take the patient from the apartment to the street, and move to an ambulance simulator, which differs from the normal one only in that there is no engine. There will also be a car in the center after the accident that will rotate and a rain and storm simulator so that students can also face the stress of working in really difficult conditions"" - he added ."
1945,"And this is supposed to be four star rooms small bathrooms destroyed and very tiny old furniture in the rooms destroyed TV almost none as for commune four channels and goodbye food hopeless monotony in every day of settling not to mention scrambled eggs sausage cheese sausage and omelets massacre dinner no different for every meal that wanted to bring 'em out I have to pay attractions for children to regret God, swimming pool cold water a lot of people have no chance to enter the sauna, what more write here unsuccessful one week holiday about the hotel the rest ok Kudowa cool city and attractions a lot I do not recommend this hotel I certainly will not use it any more"
1946,"We expected something better for this price! Old room furniture, TV sets from 25 years ago, where you can normally watch 3 channels. There are a lot of corridors in the hotel and the restaurant is painted in a simple mistake! Luckily, we bought a voucher for a butterfly but I still think we overpaid. I don't know how this hotel got 3 stars! ? It's a spa, but it has nothing to do with the spa we imagine. A MISTAKE! The girls at the reception were nice, so the only plus of this place. Greetings, Olga"
1947,"analysis 1 - lecture rewrites your script on the board, so it doesn't pay to walk if you have enough self-denial to read it at home. generally I advise against it."
1948,"The apartments are located in the city center, which makes sightseeing easier. The beach is about 15 minutes by taxi which costs about € 10 . Easy access by bus as well. There are restaurants in close proximity. We were with 2 small children (one year and 4 years) everything was ok. Kitchen with sufficient equipment. New equipment, clean! People working at the reception desk are very helpful - with a smile on their faces they give information. I recommend it for those looking for a cheap place from which you can both visit the city and get to the beaches."
1949,"The price of the hotel is not commensurate with quality. A huge layer of dirt behind the beds, peeling walls. In a triple room, one of the beds was an ordinary sofa, more like a boarding school than a hotel. It was more like a double room with an extra bed than the three we paid for. The temperature in the room at night, and it was 8 September, was unbearable. No air conditioning. After opening the window very loudly because of the nearby road and the multitude of mosquitoes. The staff asked about this, answers that it is now anyway better than July/August and in the attic rooms it is still warmer. In general, I definitely do not recommend. On praise deserves only breakfast included in the price, but over 400 zloty per day under such conditions is definitely too much."
1950,"Mr. Merdas unfortunately only holds the title of MA. He constantly regrets this : ) I have the best memory of all the mathematician on the polybud. Amazing sense of humor, constantly inserting to make the company laugh, etc . . Everything is clear and simple, and often it will tell you what tasks will be on the colloquium and it will certainly give you the exact types. . ."
1951,"Today I was 'em at that doctor's and he ended the visit in the middle of it by refusing to examine the leg that hurt me, because I came with another case, and he has no time for two cases during one visit, because he has a charmonogram and I have to understand it. It seems to me that when I come privately to the doctor with the condition, then I guess I'm not the one who has to show understanding here. Especially since I'm shortly after a complicated operation, I was smashed with crutches on the tram all over town, and I had to come down and enter from the second floor and all this with a strong footache, but it's your doctor that doesn't care because he has a charmonogram which is sacred to him. There was still time, at least 5 minutes, during which he could take a look at this foot and give at least a prescription for a painkiller, but I have the impression that the doctor got scared of the patient in the orthosis after such a complicated injury, because as soon as he took a look at the discharge, he panicked at all and avoided talking about this leg and already the visit is over, he has no time. Finally, for the patient it is less important that he enters on time and more important that he is examined and listened to. Anyway, he wrote me another rehabilitation on my shoulder, paid for of course, and told me that the previous one did not help. So I think I have grounds to doubt the professional competence of Dr. Mrozik."
1952,"Hello, I'm going with my child to Neuromed, where Dr. is taking him to the NFZ. And I have to say, unfortunately, that I have a completely different opinion. Yes, P. Dr. is a good doctor, with a lot of knowledge but her attitude to the child and to me as a parent leaves much to be desired. My son is afraid as soon as Dr. starts examining him, my son cries. As for me as a parent, after every question I ask, I notice an unpleasant expression on my face. Dr. After all, I come to her with a problem and expect some understanding, an explanation. Dr., on the other hand, is selling me out with an ironic smile on my face. As for me, very unavailable and arrogant."
1953,"I recommend the hotel to rest. It's quiet, nice, neat. We spent 3 days there with our husband, we visited the Kłodzko Valley in general, but the evenings at the hotel made our spa session (you can order exclusive), or playing billiards. Lunches served in the hotel restaurant were very tasty, traditional cuisine. Breakfast is varied, service is nice and helpful."
1954,"The application should provide the possibility to create automated rules for changing rates as well as availability. Automated rules, in the sense of linking the rates between themselves, by means of percentage or numerical relationships . So that all others can be changed by changing the base rate . The same applies to allotments . The number of available rooms should condition the opening and closing of individual channels . E.g. with a small number of available rooms we direct traffic to direct channels . Either by closing competitive platforms or by increasing the price on them compared to direct. Double-sided, partner-authorized connection . Best real-time data update . This ensures data security and correctness of prices and availability."
1955,"A day's stay in an oval block of flats with small rooms overlooking the car park at the price of 350 N is definitely too expensive. Plus a nice staff, breakfast and location and you probably have to pay for the latter in high season. Access to the parking lot is poorly marked, on a dirt road!"
1956,"We spent 4 nights at the Qubus Hotel. Great location . The rooms are very clean and reasonably well maintained . We went to the pool several times. The water was clean and warm, beautiful view from the window. And most of all, not many people in the pool or sauna - maybe it is more crowded in the season. The service on the highest level, each guest is treated with the same care. We highly recommend it."
1957,"Hotel close to the Łódź Kaliska railway station; clean and tastefully furnished room, price adequate to the service, breakfast in the form of a Swedish table - everyone will find something for themselves and tasty; hotel day set reasonably - until 12:00 so you don't have to break off early in the morning; if I'm in Łódź, I'll definitely take advantage of it : )"
1958,"I can only praise the cleaning of rooms and quite a short distance to the sea about 400m - 5 min walk. However, there are a lot of downsides: the food was only good for the survey, in which apparently too many people praised the kitchens. Beverages dispensed from distributors are made of low-quality concentrate to which we had an allergy - the wife had a strong rash on her hands. Beer diluted with water (once in the morning they got em water which had no beer colour - untrained bartender could not adjust the dispenser) The drinks on the cheapest local alcohols, after a few drinks acted as a sleeping medium. It is not possible to drink it even in the sun. The public bathrooms were dirty and the stench of them was in the hallway. By the pool deckchairs - brown aluminum with veined fabric very uncomfortable and eternally dirty did not see 'em, for 10 days someone would wash them. The sun loungers were obviously missing so you had to book them with towels until 8 o'clock. 30 . After 9 . At 00, only the beach was left. Twice, my towels disappeared by the pool when we went to breakfast - the peak of rudeness. So whoever decides to go to this hotel I'm warning. The internet lobby fails, it is paid for only one device, the whole internet is through the server so you can't fool it. The speed is also poor, but if the weather breaks down then you can only watch the text files, because the video files are not stopping to cut. Price WI - FI - 32 - left week, 50 - left 10 days . In rooms in bathrooms there is a very annoying shower (no cabin), drain is in the middle of the bathroom so if someone turns the water on strongly, almost the whole floor in the bathroom is flooded, and then you have to walk on it. Another problem is communication in Polish nobody speaks, in Russian only one older lady at the reception. It's always possible to get along on the blink of an eye but you can forget about the children's activities. The hotel is already about eight years old so the rooms would be useful to refresh and renovate the bathrooms. The hotel is focused on maximizing profits in advance. And Polish tourists treat it like air - this is especially visible at the bar. The hotel discourages guests after 7 days of stay, we did not want to use their swimming pool, they preferred to go to the beach."
1959,"I am a regular customer of this hotel. The hotel is well located in the very centre of the city. A friendly service, open to the needs of guests. Clean rooms. As I see it, the hotel is slowly but systematically modernized. And rightly so, because the room decor and bathroom arrangement is at least 30 years old. The ""age"" TV sets are a bit off. An absolute bonus for guests (and residents of Bialystok) is the hotel restaurant. This one I admit * * * * * * stars : ) . Also for a delicious and rich breakfast buffet. It is precisely because of the level of the hotel restaurant that I consider the Cristal hotel the most recommendable in Bialystok."
1960,"Hotel in a picturesque location among streams and ponds surrounded by greenery. Recommended for those wishing to relax . Nice service, cleanliness without reservations. Breakfast very good served in a separate building, outside the hotel buildings. Nice SPA area with 16 m long swimming pool, sauna area, Jacuzzi, solux lamps. The fitness zone could be more varied."
1961,"I will not assess the hotel itself because the accommodation did not take place I was planning to book em to stay in December 2014, but despite sending an inquiry to the address given on the site did not get an answer to em after two days wrote em to another address of the hotel Mr. from the reservation department informed me that they do not work mail . They exchanged a few remarks when they wrote 'em that I have already booked another hotel, they got 'em suggestions for accommodation at the cost of two days ago and free parking (as a compensation) I have already had other bookings, however, I suggested 'em so I will move these arrangements to January 2015 for another visit to Gdansk. I got information immediately that they can not provide these prices (as if the hotel prices were set by the Martians) In January 2015, I sent 'em a request for the possibility of reservation and what a coincidence, I got 'em proposals for a more expensive parking price (this supposedly free). He pointed out to them that such an approach is rather not ok and indicates the lack of class of the hotel In exchange e - meili joined the director of the hotel recognizing that everything is ok and this is the policy of the company. Of course he added his translation as for me in a version that even a child will not convinceEveryone reading this description can make up his own mind whether it is worth choosing the hotel or among many similar choose another in which there will be not only a nice room but something that can not be counted but can be felt. I appeal to everyone who thinks that this is ok should consider the other advantages of the hotel and everyone who did not want to be in my place to once choose another hotel in Gdansk because then such behavior will not be repeated """
1962,"Place - great . To the beach 3 minutes , to the promenade 1 minute , to the tourist attractions balos etc. close. Rooms - spacious, liquid fridge, bathroom stinks, balcony plus. Volume - on Saturday there was a disco nearby, but it was probably heard all over Kissamos. At the hotel by the pool there is an open bar until 22, and the Greeks are not a quiet atmosphere - very friendly, nice, smiling staff, very helpful. The food - every day for breakfast is the same, but good and filling. Close to good pubs."
1963,"Hello, I write here as a husband who looked at everything from the side of what ""miracles"" did the doctor. First of all, I found out about all the possible illnesses that a woman may have when she is pregnant, and of course, everything needed to be examined. Paid, of course. What a visit is an examination, and a visit to the reception of the examination, and the next examination and so on. My child could have been even without a brain, so I was already in a great fear and the doctor ""guru"" of course all-knowing and caring. The birth itself in his (colleagues?) clinic is a great failure. The wife is stuffed with oxytocin, which is unbearable in the absence of the opening. Shortly speaking do not disturb the woman, you have to give birth quickly because I and my friends must go home. The birth was in December, unfortunately, with the window open because the doctor and his friend smelled. ""The doctor's clinic is in the villa so the ventilation is draught and open window without any draught. I am now more aware of what happened then, because we already have the third child on the way and I know what it means to lead the pregnancy professionally and carefully. Then we didn't really know what it was all about, the wife felt subconsciously that something was wrong. Now for no treasure I wouldn't allow my wife to visit this master. I strongly recommend you ladies, spend your money wisely on a really good doctor. Maze and father."
1964,"I'm just finishing my stay at the Mercure Hotel - Zamość . I think it's okay, but. . . . . We rented two rooms. Deciding to stay at a Mercure hotel didn't even check 'em if the rooms were air-conditioned, slept 'em in a lot of hotels in the chain and it was always standard. As a result, the temperature in the room reached 29 degrees. It would have helped to open a window, but the fans are just next to the noise so at night they are gone. In the bathroom in both rooms the shower taps were broken as a result of alternating hot and cold water. In the cabin, mushroom on the walls and worms on the floor! ! ! In the friends' bathroom the cistern does not work. And finally, the Internet, which barely zips. So for this price I advise against."
1965,"The game does not deviate from the current standards in terms of graphics quality, but has a serious error that makes it virtually impossible to play. I mean, still dying saves, after a few hours of playing, it suddenly turns out that we have the records from the very beginning so progress is completely impossible. This error occurs only in the PL version, while the English versions plus spolszczenie (pirates) work perfectly. I strongly advise not to buy the PL version until the moment of the exit of the appropriate patch."
1966,"They bought us a New Year's Eve package with friends at the Lenart Hotel and I must say it was a good decision. The rooms smell, are spacious and clean. Cleaned daily very carefully. Breakfast was varied and fresh. All employees smiling, discreet and helpful. The New Year's Eve party itself was a shot in the arm ;) We were able to go forward for a year ; ) The food was varied, nothing was barracks and the price was really affordable. We will come back next year!"
1967,"Dr Jakub Gierczyński , an economics and health care specialist, reported that 8 000 people died directly from diabetes in Poland in 2017. A year earlier, 6 thousand people died of diabetes. However, many more people die due to diabetic complications. In 2017, 26 thousand people died because of diabetes complications. The reason for 70% of these deaths were cardiovascular diseases resulting from diabetes complications. Diabetologist from the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Interior and Administration Dr Alicja Milczarczyk pointed out that in Poland no drugs which have proven to be effective in cardiovascular complications are reimbursed. They reduce the possibility of death from 22 to 38%. Although these drugs are available in pharmacies, many patients are unable to take the therapy because they cannot afford to buy these drugs. She suggested that if they cannot be reimbursed for all people with vascular and cardiac complications, then at least the drugs for people after a heart attack should be reimbursed."
1968,"Mr. Doctor approaches his work professionally, very carefully and without rushing to do the tests. The patient is sure that the examination is to check the actual state of health and not just the ticking that the examination was done. During the prophylactic visit, the doctor detected a change which did not give any symptoms and which was a direct threat to health and life. The doctor described to me in detail the change, the risks and the treatment. He advised me on the way to choose the treatment. Although the change in my heart was a great surprise to me, thanks to the doctor's presentation of the whole situation, I felt calm. A week after the examination was 'em after the surgery and I can enjoy full health without the risk that something suddenly ""turns me off"". I sincerely recommend Mr. Piątkowski ."
1969,This is our second stay in this hotel. I highly recommend quiet meals tasty atmosphere cool. We will come back here for sure. You can walk for miles . . . . . .there's something there that attracts. . . We have just returned from Gran Canaria and are more satisfied with Cyprus and Veronica. I recommend
1970,"Hotelik modest, no elevator, price to quality ratio appropriate, nice service with good English, quiet neighborhood, lots of Asian bars in the area, there are towels and bed linen, cleaning the room daily. Near the subway (20 minutes to the Louvre), bakery, shops. In the afternoon you could use the kitchen and make yourself some tea or coffee or use the microwave."
1971,"Dr. Maciej, despite his young age, is a professional in every way. A very high personal culture, a factual approach to the patient, does not underestimate any questions, he is very committed. It's been a long time since I've encountered such an approach. You can see a lot of experience in what he does. It was my first time, but certainly not the last and I hope that with his help the treatment will be successful. And despite the pain of an open biopsy, she is extremely delicate. I would recommend to anyone who wanted to feel at the doctor's appointment that he is in a world class office. And he's very handsome. . . . ."
1972,"I have TWO such armchairs for a year now for the Twins, the upholstery has not been washed even once, no stains - wiped with HIPP baby biscuit cloth. The little shed has its advantages, it is designed so that even the wind does not get inside when the weather is bad. However, it has a lot of disadvantages: ( - it is heavy, very . It is good that the Husband could always go with the children to the doctor or bear my baby seat. . . I after cc wasn't able to, now I can stand blisters alone without car seats. - * * * * * * * * * * * with an apology. . . The twins were premature and it was ok in the beginning. . . . .now they are 9 months old - they weigh 10 and 11 kg and . . . . . . .I'm looking to rape other mothers. But they're already such, for sitting babies. . . No wonder the price has fallen so heavily - I've paid m much more - almost twice. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it."
1973,"Medical visit in Medicover medical center - Katowice . Very nice (hello and introduction at the very beginning of the visit) and friendly atmosphere. The doctor was very kind and friendly. During the visit, she asked a lot of questions, collecting detailed information about the state of health and recommended a medical examination without any problem. The conversation was very factual, professional and understandable. The evaluation of good results is only due to a problem that is being solved and has not been fully recognized, but I HIGHLIGHTLY recommend this internist."
1974,"He informed that the next spring session will be ""exceptionally rich in residencies"" - at the moment the recruitment for 1901 seats is ongoing. He said that this year's priority will be, among other things, general surgery because the surgeons in our hospitals are ""dramatically lacking"". In the autumn - as he added - the most places will be for doctors of internal diseases, which are also missing. Pinkas emphasized that ""we are moving away from the felicity of medicine"" . In his opinion, the project of abandonment of the internship was missed and he reminded us that work is underway on a law that will restore it. As he added, the bill should soon go to parliament. ""There will be no yearbook without internship,"" he noted. He stressed that during the internship the doctor will have the right to practice under the supervision of a tutor."
1975,"Research by Dr Edyta Brzóski-Wójtowicz is a hope, among others, for the victims of accidents in which muscle damage occurred. ""In mice such damaged tissues treated with stem cells regenerate after 14 days. In humans it will of course take longer and will depend on the size of the damage. Generally speaking, the process of muscle regeneration could take about a month"" - describes the PAP interlocutor. The speed of tissue regeneration depends largely on the condition in which we are in, how our immune system works and what we suffer from. The ability to regenerate also decreases with age. ""We have been conducting our research for several years. Now we are carrying out projects which aim to implement the results of our research. Estimating very optimistically the implementation of the whole method could take place in 10-20 years"" - reserves the interlocutor of PAP."
1976,"I strongly advise against. I confirm what my colleagues wrote - threatening infertility, doing dozens of tests, about the price of which I found out only when it came to paying for the visit (Mr. Dr . He took two tubes of blood and then it turned out that he ordered 20 tests from this, without asking beforehand absolutely if I could afford it. When she once questioned the legitimacy of performing some tests, because she already had them done (e.g. blood type - for many years I have been an honorary blood donor and each time I have the same blood type:). ) she said that there may have been some kind of mistake, which of course has fatal consequences for my health. By the way, I hope that no one in the blood donation station killed my blood type with a definitely wrong one. Ad . treatment - for 2 months of visits (unfortunately only after two months she realized that I think I am so sick I can not be) and consuming two series of antibiotics (I am not even sure if the bacteria that actually had m in her vagina) was m so sterile and without immunity that non - stop she got a cold m and caught m different pigeons for another year. Mr Lewandowski effectively discouraged me from treating infertility. After one of the subsequent visits (this time with my spouse, who got pale, as he saw that I wasn't really screwing around with it from the visit may cost 1000 PLN), he told my husband that the treatment was over. I will never in my life agree to in vitro (and not for religious reasons) and I certainly do not intend to visit another gynecologist - a star who will prey on my naivety, ignorance and put in constant stress that if I do not get something wrong, I have no chance for a child. The effect - as she wrote earlier - is about a year of restoring my immunity (healthy diet and calmer lifestyle), and for the last eight months I have been visiting a gynaecologist from the NFZ, who with great competence and patience deals with my ( !) uncomplicated pregnancy."
1977,"Last weekend I was a guest at the Park Hotel ! At first, no wifi in the room, two days of fighting and nothing! Programs only in Polish and German - weird! For breakfast there are no sweet croissants and on Sundays bread from the previous day is served! This is just the beginning: when we entered the ""cleaned room"" we ran out of words: in the shower an empty bottle of gel and half a bottle for the rest of the day for 2 people, a handkerchief that I washed my face in the morning and towels were left around the sink! Open cans with a plastic glass left on the desk as well as pieces of cardboard from the shirt were left to us later: ) In a word, tragedy ! The hotel is not on the level of 4 stars and not an inch! ! !"
1978,"She used up two bottles of this shampoo, and I'm getting a little bit of a rapture! My hair fell out in excessive amounts (about 300 - 400 a day) until the clearances appeared. Reason ? Hypothyroidism. I reached for this shampoo and after 2 weeks small needles ( baby hair ) started to appear on my head. She didn't believe my own eyes. . . Hair started to grow faster (more than 2cm per month), it definitely thickened and is much healthier. Now, after washing my hair, I lose a maximum of a dozen or so hair pins, formerly she used to take a handful from the drain. . . The only disadvantage is that the shampoo gets hair tangled up terribly : ( I recommend it to everyone who has a problem with excessive hair loss : )"
1979,"Pluses : - nice neighborhood, - nice rooms. Minuses : - no kitchenette, - no fridge, - no internet (only fejsbuk, instagram and smaller applications on the phone, about reading the trench and watching Netflix, how it rains, you can forget, - no soap in the bathrooms, - loud - you can hear every step of the neighbor, - dark in the room, - in the hotel restaurant prices are higher than in Warsaw (breakfast 40 PLN), and since there is not even a fridge, a man is forced to dine outside, - bad approach to the house - lots of stones and clay, when it rains, it is Mr. Swiatć over our soul, - dear for the night (ok . 64 zł without board, for comparison with a host in another village 55 zł with breakfast and common space - unfortunately, we booked through booking.com without any refund) Bike rental: 15 PLN per hour, each additional 10 PLN."
1980,"Dominic Lau - Cycling . The basics of training is a long awaited by me book, which finally fell into my hands. Advertised by the press and portals about cycling, recommended by friends of cyclists and on discussion forums could not go unnoticed. For me, every literature of this type is always new ideas for training and time for a possible correction of the training plan with new tips. It's only a pity that the book disappointed me rather than gave me an idea for a new, better training. More on :"
1981,"It's been six months since she got to the Doctor. She came to me tired of depression and the accompanying somatic diseases. She was crying, sore, sleepless for a long time, sad, without energy, tired of life. The doctor took care of me holistically, based on the assumption that the whole organism, and not only its sick part, should be treated. She has chosen the right cure, so together with the depression she has gone away with the concomitant ailments. She is attentive, kind, caring, full of faith in the cure and this faith is given to the patient. With a clear conscience I recommend Dr. Anne Bondyra. Thank you"
1982,"I don't recommend it. A child of 2 or 5 years old has begun to put on and signalled abdominal pain. They suspected that it might have something to do with the pile but because the child was crying they called the doctor. On the phone the doctor decided that it was definitely a problem with the poop so there was no reason to come and recommended a large dose of lactulose (syrup) and a glycerine suppository. The doctor had a completely different approach at the night duty at the clinic - she looked more closely at the child, listened and ""rubbed"" her tummy in order to exclude other ailments, which is very important for a small child."
1983,"We were in 5 people ( 3 rooms ) at the turn of August and September. They bought us this hotel from TUI as a Beach - Village complex. On the spot it turned out that TUI bought for their clients rooms in the Village part, and there the standard is 2 stars. All 3 rooms were very old and destroyed. The bathrooms were bad with stone, mushroom, stench. Destroyed furnishings, dirty walls and curtains, stench, holey bedding and stinky blankets. In the canteen there was something notoriously missing: plates, knives, forks and sometimes even tea. We could change the room for an extra 15 euros per day. I strongly advise against it."
1984,"Dr. Iwona Kurowska is a specialist and professional in her field. A great doctor with professional knowledge, additionally endowed with empathy and kindness. She also emanates peace of mind giving a sense of security to both the sick person and their caregivers. She devotes a lot of time to the patient and takes care of him holistically - body and psyche. Moreover, she gave us as carers of the elderly person a lot of valuable information and tips about the care, explained many doubts. She is definitely a doctor worth recommending . Thank you very much for taking care not only of our mother, but actually of the whole family."
1985,"He put on his feet, suffered from backache thanks to Mrs. Magda's visit got rid of the backache, which was the main focus of em, but thanks to the fact that in addition to a great massage Mrs. Magda talked to me, he managed to deal with the headache and knee pain for which he had been looking for a long time. What happened to me was that all the time he knew what he was doing (she described it well and in an easy way for me) and what it came from. I highly recommend, ""I put on my feet"" and show her prevention for the future. I strongly recommend it."
1986,"Dr Karol Borkowski removed a few of my teeth during one procedure and then implanted two implants. I am the second day after the procedure - in the first stage of treatment. I was incredibly scared. The procedure with the cooperation of dr . Małgorzata Kocowska was conducted in a professional way with super anaesthesia in a nice atmosphere. Mastery, high culture, some hands of the Doctor made me recommend him to everyone who has such a problem as me. He is a very nice doctor, he has time to talk - he explains everything and at the same time he is a professional and also punctual. I sincerely and warmly recommend! ! ! Cristina . K ."
1987,"She was at this hotel in July 2015. The hotel is located in a very quiet area, but this is what she was looking for. It consists of one-storey and one-storey bungalows. The rooms are comfortable, spacious, plus a mosquito net in the window because there are mosquitoes. The service is very polite, there is even a very nice waitress from Poland Aneta and bartender Mateusz. The whole staff is very nice. The hotel area is well maintained, lots of greenery and clean. Sandy beach, great, that there is no bar and noise of music there, because I'm looking for such intimate places. Access to the beach about 300 meters. animation I do not judge, because we do not use and best as if they were not at all. Something was going on, but they didn't make a lot of noise. Medium food. I missed water in bottles and tea for dinner and supper. The drinks from the dispensers are mega-cold and tasteless. I ended up buying me water and carrying it to the canteen with the all option. There is no shower by the pool, so people jump into the water, greased with creams and the water is completely cloudy. On the left side of the horizon you can see two electron chimneys, which unfortunately smoke. There is no smell of smoke, but it interferes with the wonderful view of the sea! ! ! Sunsets are wonderful. To sum up, the hotel is worth recommending, and a few disadvantages did not affect the quality of the holiday."
1988,"A very objective doctor. I came with the diagnosis after the gastroscopy so basically in my case it was about defining the treatment but the Doctor made a very good impression on me, the impression of a professional who knows his stuff. Now, before me the treatment, but I realize that its effectiveness depends on the medicine not on the doctor. After this first visit (and I hope that it will be the last) I strongly recommend it (and I am also recommended by the doctor)."
1989,"A little information for the disappointed ""patient-tourists"": maybe they've mistaken the specialists ( ?) You feed on information from various Internet forums, make a diagnosis to each other and expect a good doctor to stick your guesses to you. Yes, I have been Dr. Daroszewski's patient for a long time and reading some of the entries I can't get out of my mind. Maybe it's the competition doing black PR. I go to visits both privately and at the NFZ at the clinic and I never felt ""drenched."" and I have to admit I'm a rather complicated case and often ask stupid or annoying questions. A few stays in the hospital and always the right treatment, and most importantly - preceded by a meticulous diagnosis. Professionalism and stoic calm - and this should probably be expected from a specialist. If they were looking for someone to pat someone's back at every premenstrual tension, andropause or menopause, look for a psychologist."
1990,"I was with this doctor privately, he didn't show any interest and he didn't let me tell you in detail about the whole percentage of the previous treatment before visiting his office. It seemed to me that there was no time for me and my health problems had already lasted for 2 months. He wrote out a prescription and notes on what kind of tests I should go for. That's all."
1992,"""The patch, which would be a few centimeters in size, + would be stuck + would be in place of the infarction scar. After a few weeks the stem cells would transform into target cells, i.e. into vessels and heart cells or support the regeneration of this area"" - describes Dr Sielicka . ""So far it has been shown that stem cells are very willing to transform into blood vessel cells, which increases the oxygenation of the heart and reduces the place of ischemia,"" the scientist adds. If a patient who has had a heart attack had stem cells in a cell bank, he could have received a patch made by scientists after a few days. ""Stem cells help to reduce the scar. They will also allow the patient to function normally because his heart will be more stable, stronger and more efficient. Increasing the heart's efficiency by 10% can translate into much greater activity and physical fitness,"" the researcher argues."
1993,"We had a spa with our husband from children = overnight at 31 . 10 . 15 Spa ok . full professionalism nice service but already the hotel part of the massacre . The room for a married couple two separate beds (it's a pity only that between them they planted chaperones) Dinner could not be eaten in the restaurant because there was a prom, another minus we went to town for dinner. You couldn't sleep either because the so called young people who had a prom there instead of having fun were chanting until 6 am in the hallway screaming mercilessly. The nightmare was a waste of our children's and our children's money for fuel because we were going 170 km there. No more visits in this regret God's hotelups.this is my second comment because the first was not allowed by Trip Advisor"
1994,"We were on a week-long holiday with the TUI office. The location of our room ( 6108 ) was optimal due to the children's pool and the proximity of the reception with the main restaurant. The food was very varied. In addition, a very nice staff who made sure that no one had to wait for the table (especially the Polish staff was nice). There was no crowd in the pools, and if someone bothered the children could only go to the adult pool in the Satellite area. Very nice was the aquapark, which offered entertainment for small children and adults."
1995,"This bowl is a mistake. Its upper and lower dimension is too small to reach the lower bar in a flush-mounted frame (in my case - Geberit Duofix). The effect ? The bowl hangs only on top screws, without any support from below. It bends and in a painted cardboard box it literally made a hole through. The bowl will go to complain, and I have to look for something new. I think that Catalano designers themselves know about their defective product, so now only a new version of the bowl is being produced, with an increased upper and lower dimension and with completely hidden attachments (without plastic caps on the side). A standing version of the bowl is also available. It is certainly a better choice than this bubble. On the positive side, the bowl is nice and short. Unfortunately, nothing justifies the defective shape, hence the 1 star ."
1996,"Wonderful place with wonderful hosts . There is a gym, bicycles, a sauna on the lake, a fireplace, a public kitchen, a playroom for children and a home cinema. I recommend it for trips with friends, in pairs or with family."
1997,"Room: we stayed in the Junior Suite, very large, spacious rooms, a Jacuzzi inside. Large windows overlooking Turtle Island, step from the pool room. At night you can see the milk road beautifully - it really is an amazing view: ) What as what, but such conditions even the most demanding tourist may call a luxury. Very intimate, without the hotel crowd. The only thing that may not work is the neighbors - we have just found a Polish man from the UK. They had a drink every night and they seemed to be alone. The rooms were cleaned daily, the water in the pool was cleaned once a week. Air-conditioning and fridge are additionally paid for. On the terrace by the rooms, some visual separation of the space between the rooms would be useful - in the evening, some people were able to stay in front of someone else's room, which effectively deprived them of privacy: ) Location: hotel located in a quiet village of Porto Koukla (which literally means Port Dolls :) ) The beach by the hotel is beautiful (and close), the sun loungers are said to be free if you buy something in the bar, but all week long we used the beach for free without any problems: ) Beach to Agios Sostis ok . 5 min . on foot, to the island of Cameo (with ""sheets"") ok . 20 min . and to Laganas about . 40 min . I advise not to go on foot on the roads, because it is much longer. Hotel: I'll write right away that there is no internet - it didn't bother me, but some people are addicted and it can be a problem: ) The network is, but it just doesn't work, and when it does, it works for a few seconds and nobody from the staff cares: ) Eating okay, no crazy, but you can get eaten, breakfasts between 8 - 10, dinners between 19 - 21. All this time the food is added on a regular basis. What's the downside is paid drinks for dinner - it's a misunderstanding: ) You better take your own. Next to the hotel a very good Vardiola pub: ) As far as I know, people in ordinary rooms complained about the lack of water and unpleasant smell - in the Junior Suite it was not. Earlier he read 'em that there are stray animals running in the hotel - we met only a small harmless cat :) To sum up, the biggest advantage is the views from the hotel, the biggest disadvantage is the neighbors: )"
1998,"A very pleasant place in terms of appearance and location . Ideal for couples and . . . . pensioners - outside the palace, the place offers absolutely nothing. The service at the reception desk is very professional, in the sauna zone also, while in other places (brewery and restaurant) - it is much worse. . . In the brewery I waited 15 minutes for you to cope with the payment, running every moment up and down, unprepared and incompetent. Natopmiasto just a beer revelation - the clearest point of departure. In the restaurant, very expensive food and no crazy - we got raw fries for that. To our assurance that they are raw you are responsible that they are already raw. . . Fortunately, after the discussion, we managed to convince you to bring new ones. . . . .unfortunately not too different from previous ones. In the morning, breakfast offers a wide range of good food, but. . . . . . .very poor coffee. I ordered a cappuccino, which, as it turned out, is extra payable. . . As for the 4 * it's definitely below the norm. During the long weekend there was an additional attraction - live songs from famous musicals - it would probably be fun if not for the fact that old people poured some unknown melodies into the microphone (although the retired people liked it:)) On the place of family with children (30 %) and retired people (70 %) - also for a rest in peace and quiet ideal place."
1999,"Dearly beloved called me yesterday a friend (they met us in this clinic) had an abdominal plasticity there the girl was crying, had blood transfusions, biopsies and all the time she was seeping out of her belly, little of this zero care after, she was in another clinic today the doctors could not be surprised, that this kind of sewing on a ship is done in these days, people don't believe in these positive opinions, they write these mean women like nurses I know what I'm saying she was there and she saw m but she gave up m if you want to risk it is your problem! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Good luck, maybe you'll be about 20% of those who did."
2000,"I strongly discourage people who want to have a sedentary operation with Mr. Bielecki, which requires improvement of the apex. I join the list of dissatisfied people - the effect of the operation was macabre, the nose curved, bending in one direction. After several visits the doctor graciously wanted to make a correction, but I was afraid to risk it. I decided to make a correction with Dr. Skupinia (not one of me, anyway...) and now I am very satisfied : - ) To sum up, Dr Bielecki definitely advises against everything!"
2001,"A very factual visit, concrete. The diagnosis made on the first visit - which surprised me a little bit, because I had been with two other dermatologists before and they were aiming to prescribe me new and new specifics. The doctor prescribed me medication for a month, then to control. I hope that the diagnosis is finally right and the treatment will be successful."
2002,"First and last time ! ! ! ! This is the worst gynecologist I've ever seen in LuxMed. I agree with the opinions of others that he is a very weak doctor. She was treated in advance and received with great grace. I'll add that you have taken me in privately and I will make a complaint about it. She did not want me to work in this institution. I will not describe the situation for what reason she was m . People like her shouldn't be doctors at all, she should change her profession if she doesn't like it, because what a pleasure it is to work as a customer. In the state facilities a little bit of a surprise, they get a lot of money, but in private. I am sorry! ! ! And she was with other gynaecologists at LUxMed and she thought about some of them differently, but she didn't expect such a nice visit! ! !"
2003,"I sincerely advise against tourists accustomed to the standard * * * who would like to be able to take a shower every day, use the internal telephone, or spend time quietly in the sauna. Unfortunately this will not be possible. The price of the silhouette packages indicated a good quality, the description of the SPA and the photos were encouraging. Unfortunately, it actually looks a bit different. It was cold in the rooms, we had to ask for additional quilts! Water did not always flow to the 3rd floor and 3X during the 4-day stay we had to wash on another floor. . . The phone remained deaf, despite a request for repair - the foreman said that in our room will never work. . . The sauna can only accommodate 3 people, although the receptionists accept a fee for 5 people. The sauna can only be used when the masseur is not working, because the rest room serves as his office. . . The shower drain in the sauna was so clogged that every time a lake was created. . . The meals were good, but dietary, even during the New Year's Eve dinner, which was very modest. The hotel is quite clean, the service is nice, it makes up for a little bit of the lack of competence. The hotel has about 30 rooms, the noise level is average. It is suitable for training, for people who do not have time to rest. . ."
2004,"I didn't like the visit, and I'm not coming back. According to me there wasn't enough commitment, few explanations, I expected to consider various options, comments and advice on the best solution to my situation. The visit was superficial, without any overall recommendations, such as a visit to the dentist before the appliance is fitted; a major deficiency."
2005,"This is the stage of the purchasing process in which the consumer makes a decision by searching the Internet and communicating with the recommendations of other users. It is located between the purchase stimulus and closing the sale, and in our case making a reservation. The stimulus can be family, friends, colleagues, OTA, TripAdvisor, blogs, traditional press or social media. ZMOT itself: search engines, internet maps, opinion portals, guides and also social media. The difference is that theoretically a visit to the ZMOT platform leads directly to the final reservation."
2006,"I have a question about the conduct of the pregnancy, does he often perform tests, e.g. KTG and Doppler flow assessment in case of hypertension in the second part of the pregnancy and admission to the hospital? I am just thinking about changing my doctor and I take into account, among others, Dr. Five. Thanks in advance. Greetings"
2007,"The first project to be put up for sale is the Millennium Hotel "" . . .we read in the announcement. The Management Board of EFH decided to start the buy-back of own shares again. This is an implementation of the company's General Meeting of Shareholders from last year (2011), which authorized the company's Management Board to buy back up to PLN 25 million of its own shares. The buy-back of treasury shares is the company's response to the current valuation of its assets, which - in the opinion of the Management Board and shareholders - is far from the valuation of its assets. Share capital of the European Mortgage Fund S . A Mortgage Fund's share capital amounts to PLN 146.6 million and is divided into 146.6 million shares with a nominal value of PLN 1.00 each. At the closing of the WSE session on 3 July 2012 the share price of EFH shares was PLN 0.44 ."
2008,I must admit that I was surprised to read the above opinions. I personally came into contact with your doctor when our son was 2 weeks old. Like any young mother when I heard from the pediatrician that we would have to go to a cardiologist's because there was a buzz over my heart I was very frightened. I do not doubt that the doctor is an outstanding specialist and the way she treated me during the visit leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe I've had a bad day. That's a shame.
2009,"Small hotel, small rooms but large bathrooms with shower and hairdryer, clean and modern. The air-conditioning system is working, the fridge did not work here, but we did not use it anyway. The rooms have a side view of the sea. The bar is only by the pool, but for such a number of people enough, without crowds and queues and most importantly WITHOUT CHILDREN! ) peace and quiet, you can have a good rest and relax. The pool is small but deep, and few people use it. The beach is a few steps away from the hotel. The number of sun loungers is rather sufficient, but it is worthwhile to occupy them already ok. 8 because later there is a problem to find two free ones next to each other. Beautiful views! A few meters from the shore there is a floating platform on which you can sunbathe. A small restaurant but everything is . Every day two kinds of meat . Potatoes, pasta or rice quite cold - probably the only minus. Coffee, tea and other drinks available non-stop. Fruit is only watermelon, melon, apples and oranges. A large selection of cakes. Waiters are still on the move, cleaning tables. Smiles and miles. WIFI is very weak, it works only at the reception and restaurant but has a poor coverage. There are many shops in the area - I recommend Migros and Textile Outlet Center. Euros I recommend to exchange near the port, near the hotel the course is ok. 1E = 3TL . Generally we are very satisfied!"
2010,"We were having dinner on Sunday. The occupancy rate was amazing. The time waiting for the card is about 10 minutes, another 15 to accept the order. For the order itself about 40 minutes, but we were warned about it. The food was tasty, although it arrived cold. The waitresses are busy and tired, there are far too few of them. Despite the efforts of the staff, some tables remain untidy after previous guests for a long time. Definitely too few staff. We waited for the bill about 20 minutes after we asked for it. The restaurant should either have more staff or fewer tables. Unfortunately, with the condition as it is now, the quality of service is very low."
2011,"comfort weak, unsightly rooms, moving tiles in bathrooms, swimming pool only open for 12 hours, cold water, poor food, small choice, bad coffee, only dinner available and no restaurant where you could buy something and far away to the center, broken bowling alley."
2012,"It seems that all chain hotels - out of 16 football teams' residence bases for Euro 2012 only the 4 listed were hotels of international chains - were ""eliminated"" from the tournament after the group phase of the tournament. Does it mean that comfortable ""chain hotels"" attractively located in city centres, despite their advantages, would provide football players with worse conditions for sleep, rest and concentration than independent hotels located far from the big city noise? Or maybe the hotels ""bet"" simply on the weaker or lesser teams? No. The choice of facilities by individual representations was a resultant of the location, the offer (including price) and individual preferences of the selectors, and depended more on the representation than the facilities themselves. In sport - which was also clearly shown by the course of the Euro 2012 tournament so far - there is no 100%. The ""sure-fire"" and both potential leaders and potential ""black horses"" had to give in to those who turned out to be better or luckier."
2013,"Hello. She had her elbow operated on in May 2012, Mr. Doctor Narwan as if he wanted to do everything quickly and quickly it can run for a hundred! The elbow nerve as he jumped so far jumps 3500 for 40 minutes of the surgery, God bless you, in addition I have an ugly scar (where attention! She had three times operated on her leg and there you do not see these scars as on the elbow! ! There's no way to disfigure myself by going to the doctor, after that time I'll look for another one that will improve my elbow's appearance, although where to look, I'm already discouraged to doctors, especially those with these titles. The gym is out, generally the elbow is much weaker eh pity words. Writing a postdoctoral dissertation is a possibility and how it translates into life. Nothing."
2014,"For the time being, the first attempts at intragastric feeding of children have been made. Preparations for breastfeeding by the mother of twins are also underway. Dr Kociszewska - Najman emphasized that it is very important to start feeding children with natural food. ""However, the mother of the boys takes care of lactation and tries to make it possible"" - she added. The doctors explained to the journalists why the operation to separate the Siamese twins was carried out immediately after the birth. Usually,"" admitted prof . Kaminski - such procedures are performed later after the birth. However, in the case of the Warsaw twins, immediate intervention was necessary because they were both born with a defect in the umbilical hernia, which threatened to cause further defects, mainly in the urinary tract."
2015,"She was at your doctor's office at 10 Dąbrówki Street in an emergency - she lost her voice. The doctor did not interview me at all. When she wanted to tell me how the disease was progressing before the almost complete loss of voice occurred she interrupted me and did not let me finish. She was rude, and her statements were laconic. She acted like she was a doctor for punishment. She diagnosed laryngitis, but she did not prescribe me antibiotics but lime and allertec. The next day she felt even worse and started to get feverish. She went to a doctor (another one) who prescribed me antibiotics and wrote me a weekly L4."
2016,"Excellent approach to the patient, not pulling and pulling on the casing as it is in other surgeries, Mrs. Dr. very delicate and nice and the teeth treated in a way indistinguishable from untreated, sister also OK but would recommend me more to Mrs. Dr. Romaniuk"
2017,"Inspired by the following posts, I am writing my opinion. Simple, LABELLING PROBLEMS with knees in fact Dr. Żbikowski solves it right away. Then the diagnosis is not difficult and the procedure and the collection of several thousand. THE DIAGNOSIS IS NOT DIFFICULT AND A FEW THOUSAND OF THEM ARE COLLECTED. Thanks to ""Doctor "" Żbikowski my knee problem was not diagnosed in time, but it was obvious to doctors from Bielsko Biała (St. Luke's hospital), which was confirmed by the MRI. And it was thanks to doctor Żbikowski that my period of recovery instead of one year (according to doctors from Bielsko Biała) was extended to 4 years. So I wish you a lot of health after your visits to the doctor."
2018,"Multi-room house in the second row of houses - rooms modestly furnished, clean but no air conditioning. Parking is at the house. Unfortunately the bathroom is shared. Breakfast - sweet bread and coffee - modestly. For one night you can, but maybe you shouldn't stay in this town for longer. . . ?"

Tasks on colloquia simple, additionally allows you to have a card with patterns, which makes it very easy to pass. Very nice, at the beginning of the class presents a short theory to exercise, for those who do not know what is going on: P It is worth going to the board, it gives additional points. With a pass of zero problems, even for the weaker ones, it additionally helps to do some task on the consultation and pushes on 3.0: ) Great."
2020,"He warned against poorly understood economic patriotism. Emphasising the issue of responsibility for patients, he stressed that good Polish companies and products should be supported. At the same time, each of the companies, regardless of the owner or location, may invest in Poland, develop the research and development department or contribute to the development of innovation. ""Therefore, let us not say that only Polish companies, or that we support Polish companies. Only at the moment there is an imbalance in the other direction.

2021,"She's neither nice nor competent to me. With severe headaches she spread her hands and asked me what she expected from her ""I have to swallow strong powders and the tumor in my head will not look for. When I offered a thorough head examination she pointed out that it was on my request because she is accounted for it and I have to treat with another doctor because I will not make an idiot out of her. I was shocked because I have a small child and in case of seizures I can't function normally, I vomit and barely look at the eyes, but she considered it to be a minor ailment of the head examination."
2022,"Dr. Pawelas is a good doctor who is still very interested in his specialization and has knowledge about ""novelties"". If the doctor has time, he is happy to answer questions, explain in detail. Unfortunately, sometimes it happens that the time provided for one patient is not enough and then the doctor is in a hurry to provide only necessary information. That is why it is best to be well prepared for the visit, to know what you want to ask the doctor about and not to waste time. This is a doctor by appointment."
2023,"Several of our facilities, including the most popular ones, are being renovated and thus excluded from tourism. This was the case with the highly successful Parador in Cadiz, which is located in an extremely attractive region of Andalusia for foreigners. This facility offers 120 rooms. This has obviously led to a decrease in the number of visitors. Back to the crisis, it forced us to lower our prices and construct our offer in such a way as to make customers stay with us. How much have you reduced the prices for accommodation? In order to face the crisis, we launched a special marketing campaign, preparing various packages, such as 20% discount for stays in HB formula for at least 2 nights. Another proposal is the Golden Days program for people over 55 years of age offering 30% discount (in the case of this program, the second person in the room, even if he or she is younger, also pays the discounted price - red . ) ."

2025,"As for the screens, I must say that this is one of the most banal forms of course completion. The questions can be found on the web, every year they are the same, so regardless of their level of difficulty in passing there is no problem. Just sit down the day before, find, print out, take it with you and download it (more pro, put it on your memory) and that's it. I don't know what you can have a problem with here."
2026,"Lekarz wyglądał na dość oderwanego i nieostrożnego, ale to nie było nic wielkiego. Problem polega na tym, że przepisał mi niewiarygodną ilość leków (9 dziennie!), uważanych za szalone i bezwartościowe również przez mojego osobistego włoskiego lekarza."
2027,"I consider the standard of the hotel to be weak. It's very weak for this network. In the hotel at the airport they serve breakfast from 6 o'clock. . . Misunderstanding! The restaurant is weak. . . I was served with black bread, then sour cream with pickled mushrooms. : ) Customer service average ."
2028,"I got 'em on an ultrasound course. No heating in the room . Frozen in the morning looking for em in the closet for an extra blanket. Fortunately, he found 'em. Ramo asked em to intervene. I was told at noon that the system was vented. That's not true! ! ! ! The next day, they loudly expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of reaction. I was told that the problem was definitely solved. Unfortunately, without a result. ! ! ! ! I pulled a screwdriver out of the car and vented the heater in the bathroom myself! It was enough to warm up the atmosphere in the room with the door open. Until the end of my stay on the course no one solved the problem with the heating ! This is how you treat guests at the Artis Hotel. I would advise you to avoid it,"
2030,"From holidays in Siorios we returned in mid-July. The hotel is very nice and well-kept. The rooms are clean, renovated, cleaned daily. The food is quite good. And the downside. . . . .room we had in the main building, where you can not sleep longer than up to 6. The slamming of the door and the screams of the cleaning lord didn't let us. . . . .a double room with an extra bed very tiny. . . And attention. . . Cyclades... It's been so loud all day. You seem to get used to it, but unfortunately, it's not true. The lack of music in the pool and the silence after 22 at the hotel was also strange. Even so, our vacation was a success."
2031,"I don't recommend this doctor, my dad was treated by him, we were travelling over 300 km to Warsaw to visit the doctor after the surgery to remove the tumor, the only thing the doctor limited himself to on check-ups is a 2-minute gestation after removing the tumor, and that's it! ! ! Since the operation was performed by your doctor! Dad during check-up visits never received a CT referral or an MRI, I will only add that Dad has a malignant cancer. At the moment, thanks to the ""wonderful"" treatment of your doctor, your dad has a relapse of the tumour (which he was able to feel himself) plus distant metastases. Of course, the doctor was very surprised how it can be metastasized when his visits lasted 2 minutes! ! ! ! In good conscience I do not recommend it! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ...and I hope you stay as far away from such professionals as possible! !"
2032,"This was my first visit to the doctor's office, I am very pleased - she explained in a concrete and factual way what the problem is and how to solve it. She is very kind, patient and detailed in answering questions, she explains. At no point did she feel rushed, on the contrary, I think she hit me in the 10 when it comes to the doctor. 4 stars just because my grade includes one meeting."
2033,"I think Mr. Arthur Gralec is a great doctor. He's specific, objective, firm, conscientious and thorough. Calm and calm. He has a lot of respect and patience for patients. He will listen, explain what you need, answer every question. Nice and polite, with a sense of humor. An excellent surgeon. Thanks to him I still have both breasts. At the E.R. another doctor informed me that I will have a breast amputation. Fortunately, that didn't happen. Mr. Dr. Gralec had a saving operation. I am very grateful to him for that. Three months have passed since the surgery. There were no complications. The wound has healed nicely. I am full of admiration and appreciation for Dr. Gralec. I have great confidence in him. He's a really great doctor. Grażyna ."
2034,"I was satisfied with the course of the visit itself. I can't have any objections here. The doctor is in a way a specific person, who knows what I'm talking about. I don't mind, as long as he treats well. At the moment, what the doctor suspected, even if the fears are well chosen, will be positive. For this moment I start treatment, also for the effects you have to wait for, So far I am satisfied. The doctor has a professional approach, he explains everything. One thing that I can stick to, hence the good, not very good, is the waiting time for an appointment. I had an appointment at 14:40 and she entered at 16:30. It was the first time that I had to wait so long for a private visit. MINUS"
2035,"I think it's a very nice hotel in the center. The service is very nice, you can see that it is trying, very quick to respond to any request. The room is spacious, clean with a very comfortable big bed. . . . .I can't remember when I got such a good night's sleep in the hotel. Standard breakfast but tasty. Wifi was easily connected to both the room and the restaurant. The facility is also recommended as a conference facility although the rooms are of medium size. The advantage is also a large parking lot behind the hotel, much more comfortable than the tight underground parking lots at some hotels. Two steps away from the hotel is a very large gallery. Generally the hotel is on the 5th. . . maybe with a small minus (I couldn't find a socket in the bathroom :) I'll definitely come back here and recommend it to others!"
2036,"We went to the Marina for 3 days to get some stress. For a long time we were looking for a suitable hotel until the decision was finally made and we set off to Olsztyn. The hotel is about 2.5 km away from the Old Town, so you can easily go for a walk. The rooms are spacious and practically furnished and the bed is very comfortable. The spa area is also well-stocked - there are 3 saunas, 2 swimming pools and a jacuzzi (which works probably only in the afternoon or depending on who is sitting in it, because sometimes we had a problem with turning it on). The best thing is the pool from which you have a view of the lake, which in winter is extremely pleasant. Breakfast is abundant, everything is fresh and good quality. I don't see any disadvantages in this hotel and we will gladly go again."
2037,"Hands are dropping that this is how the centres can function nowadays. The reception desk is closed from one hour. 17 - lack of staff . In the restaurant during meals, there are no cups for drinks, no cutlery, when there are cups, there is no coffee or tea - cabaret; - ) When there are cutlery, there are no plates, seriously - somebody who leads it should knock on the head and think a little bit, just invest 1000 PLN in extra hats and cups, really not much and how much it will change the image ; - ) but, uh, if someone is just thinking about making money, it's no wonder. A children's playground, dirty carpets, ""fogloraj"" dirty, I don't know if even someone before the season has vacuumed there. The rooms are cleaned up quickly, to accommodate more guests, nothing more, no extra initiative. Generally, this center has no manager who will put everything in order, you can see that the owners pity the money on a person with experience, they combine on their own and let it work out as cheaply as possible and at the same time the greatest profit. In the restaurant it turned out more than once that there were no tables, because there were too many guests than places ; - ) All of this is a sign of high professionalism and customer care. My rating of 2 more I will not go back there, even for free, a man all year long plans a vacation, and here one great failure. As mentioned to 'em, the money is better than positive feedback."
2038,"What is more important, however, is what the guest identifies the hotel with as a brand or with whom as a person and on this basis decides to enter into a more advanced business relationship. It can be a well-known brand, own brand, or from a promotional point of view no - name in the style of ""employee rooms"" and from the market point of view the most recognizable object in the area. Also, when it comes to people, the ""face"" of the relationship can be the owner of the property (often having other companies from which he is known), the director, the head of sales or marketing, the reception desk and any employee who has direct contact with the guest."

2040,"He stayed overnight at this hotel during his business trips and spent ok . 1 year . The rooms are different from those in the pictures unfortunately to the detriment of . They are cleaned every day, but on the principle of folding ( exchange ) towels, bedding and throwing away garbage ( no vacuuming ) . Next to the hotel there is a bar where during the weekends it is quite noisy especially when you have a room from the car park. The hotel organizes events, so you can also find an interesting night. The offer is written that there are English and continental breakfasts, but we have a choice of English or cereal with milk, or a small glass of yoghurt. You can ask for cheese and sausage, omelette, scrambled eggs or hard-boiled eggs, but the staff will not inform you about it. The advantage is the view from the room to the sea, but then we have a street where cars go crazy at weekends. From the hotel it is close to the local promenade, to the train station and bus depot from where we can go further. The hotel has a swimming pool and a gym. Personally I did not use 'em so I do not know what it looks like and if it is worth going there."
2041,"According to the previous information, the examination was to be carried out together with ultrasound. Unfortunately, the examining doctor decided that it was unnecessary. Due to the increasing pain caused by a dangerous fall, I decided to repeat the examination in another centre. This time the doctor decided that the examination with ultrasound is even necessary. Without this, he would not have been able to make a proper diagnosis. I would like to mention that I am an elderly woman (88 years old) and it seems to me that every accident (I am very bruised and hard to move around) should be diagnosed properly."
2042,"No more shared bathrooms, early breakfasts and nylon sheets. The twilight of lower-standard pensions and Bed and Breakfast facilities, which are being replaced by budget hotel chains, is being replaced by the British daily newspaper ""The Independent"". The dynamic development of cheap hotels and the increase in guests' expectations threaten the existence of traditional, cheap facilities. Some will be forced to raise their standards, others will have to leave the market. This is already happening: since 2007 over 1.5 thousand B&B facilities with a standard below three stars have been closed in England. In Scotland, the number of guesthouses of 1 - 2 stars standard has decreased by 63%. The number of budget hotels increased by 80%. A third of the guest houses and B&Bs in the UK had fewer guests in the first half of this year than the year before, writes "" The Independent "" . Alex Polizzi, granddaughter of the well-known hotelier Lord Forte (Forte Group, the initiator and investor of the reconstruction of the Bristol Hotel in Warsaw in the early 1990s). - note Editors) The hotel is not surprised, but on the contrary, it is satisfied with the fact that B&B facilities are being displaced by hotels."
2043,"I was referred to this doctor at the age of 14 with a shortened knee, and over the course of several years I underwent 5 operations on my right knee and one on my left knee, including one patella reconstruction. I will never say a bad word to the doctor because of him! A professional doctor in every way! Today I'm 22 years old and I feel great, my knees sometimes hurt and even though I have a habitual dislocation of the kneecap, nothing like this has happened for several years! Thank him for what he did for me. ."
2044,"Hello, I can not agree with negative opinions, I was at the doctor's twice with the child first at the check-up and then at the ultrasound examination, yes he is very reserved in his words, you could say that he has dried up but I do not think that this is the way to keep him smiling and saying nice things, to be an expert in his work. He helped us to follow his recommendations and now everything is on the right track. . However, looking at the parents (when I was waiting with my child for our turn), it also leaves a lot to be desired (and this is their pretensions that we need a referral, and these pretensions from the card they did not assume in the registration and the doctor did not accept,) because he also acts on the basis of certain procedures and so it seems to me that he bends them in favor of patients. I think that the doctor is ok."
2045,"They spent a nice week in Hora. Beautiful views. Lovely beach. A super pool. Nice and English-speaking staff! Everywhere's clear. The weakest point was the meals - breakfasts and dinners - monotonous and small amounts, for breakfasts it is better to be on time. We will be happy to go back there, but we will be dining out!"
2046,"Hotel renovated three swimming pools including a wading pool with bubbles in the middle pool bar, nice clean rooms, cleaned daily towel change twice a day. The meals good though for a longer stay can be monotonous. Daily animations . Drinks good, service very nice and helpful, bartenders sensational in the bar in the lobby illusionist bartender I recommend this hotel with a clear conscience."
2047,"When Dominika Nowis wonders how to destroy cancer, she always checks that her methods of fighting will not destroy our healthy organs. She is the first in the world to examine whether proteasome inhibitors impair heart function. The work she and Dr. Nowis have done together with Dr. Nowis is the first to examine whether the proteasome inhibitors are impairing heart function. Gaetano Vattemi from the University of Verona, was to help doctors to better select patients for treatment with proteasome inhibitors to reduce the risk of unexpected side effects. It turned out that although the drugs are toxic, the effects of the drugs are gone after some time of withdrawal. Patients do not need to be afraid that they will recover from the cancer in order to die of heart failure. The researcher has also been looking for ways to kill cancer with light for many years. First she ""sensitizes"" cancer cells to light and then uses a killer combination of oxygen and laser light. However, cancer is a tough opponent. When it turned out that some cancers can survive such a murderous therapy, the researcher inhibited some enzymes that helped them to do so. Publications on this subject have accepted reputable journals promoting the achievements of world biochemistry and experimental oncology."

Father Irek is an incredible leader of the classes. Although he does not check the attendance, he gives a grade for it and it is 4, in practice there is a short conversation with him after which you have 5 and he really speaks, the students listen. As I said before, he does not check the presence and leads so interestingly that people come anyway. It is hard to get to his course, only this year he has two dates. When you have the first day of enrolment after 18, you can forget about the vacancy: ] . I RECOMMEND IT!"

The comparison of the hotels' performance on the basis of the data collected by STR Global for the period October 2011 to October 2010 shows a positive trend in the industry's performance in terms of basic currencies. Randall adds that the cities that recorded the highest revenue drops per room available missed one major event this year, which had been lifting the rates up the year before.

Meanwhile, in fetal life, human wounds heal without any scars. ""If the operation on a child is carried out in the womb, then the child is born without a scar, it is not visible where the operation took place. It means that in our developmental life we really have a feature of scar-free healing, regeneration, in adult life we lose it.

2054,"I advise against all women of this doctor. Of course, he diagnosed me with the same ailments described below and prescribed the same drugs. He claimed that I cannot have children but he will help me. After two years of treatment with his methods, of course, without any pregnancy tests, there was still no more. She went to my head for wits and registered me with another doctor who ordered a number of tests and made such an accurate diagnosis and prescribed effective treatment that after 6 months I got pregnant. The basic issue in the treatment of infertility is to recommend a semen examination of the husband, which Dr Markuszewski did not do. I suppose that all his patients who gave birth to children during the treatment were simply lucky. I mean, they were not really infertile but he told them so. I SINCERELY ADVISE AGAINST IT! I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST TIME, HEALTH AND MONEY."
2055,"We had a pleasure to spend a few days in the Krasicki Hotel, which curious us by its appearance and history. Rooms are cozy and interestingly decorated. . . We were lucky to have windows from the room overlooking the courtyard, so we were not stuffy because the lack of air conditioning can be troublesome on hot days, although we would have to be understanding for the historical walls: ) . The double bed was comfortable with one mattress and that's a big plus, and when it comes to boarding in, package' is what to choose from.

2057,"She found me in Dr. Markuszewski's house with a very bad mood because of an acute urinary tract infection just to check if there was also a genital tract infection. It so happened that the gynecologist, who I am constantly treating, was on leave, so she went where she had the closest to me. Dr. M. in pain, the patient, who was lying in a chair, would not let me tell her what she was coming with, claiming that she would tell me herself, and I would only confirm it. After that he gave me a long lecture on hygiene, on the fact that I sleep badly, and during an ultrasound examination he invented some adhesion of the uterus with the ovary, through which I could not get pregnant. When I showed him the result of an ultrasound a few months ago, where everything is ok, he looked at it and gave it back to me with the words ""he doesn't know about it"". He gave me, of course, a file of prescriptions, including for Biostreptaza - suppositories that would dissolve these adhesions. He recommended 5 teddy bear treatments, one of which costs over 150 PLN. My gynecologist, who I was with only a month earlier, said that everything was fine with me. She was scared by the news about the adhesions and consulted with a third gynaecologist. . . . . .and he said that my genital structure is perfectly normal and that there are no adhesions. I can't imagine what kind of man you have to be to tell a well-built woman a story about not being able to have children, unless she takes the wonderful suppositories, which of course are best bought at the clinic. I will add that these were not suppositories - placebo, completely indifferent to health. . . ."

""Mice drink alcohol and are very willing to drink it. However, it is a little more difficult to say whether mice can be addicted to alcohol"" - says Radwańska . In her research work she deals with, among other things, animal models of alcohol addiction, and one of her research goals is to understand the molecular, cellular background of the addiction memory. ""If a psychiatrist is to determine whether his patient is addicted to alcohol, for example, he asks him specific questions: how long he has been drinking, whether his drinking translates into his private and professional life. We, in a sense, have to ask the same questions to mice, which, as we know, answer less willingly"" - describes the researcher."

We are also convinced that this cooperation will contribute to improving the quality of medical education, because the theoretical subjects will be taught by scientists who apply this theory in their daily work at the NIL"" - says the Rector of Lazarski University, prof . Krystyna Iglicka - Okólska . She emphasized that the priority for the university she is managing is ""practical education"" and the agreement signed will be helpful in this task."
2061,"She's had a cold for a few days. She didn't want me to go to the doctor, but the disease has won. Luckily, I was admitted on time (it has never happened to me before), the Doctor prescribed me the medicines that cured me in two days (!). In addition, he improved my mood, he has like young people say combed sense of humor: ) More doctors like that, we won't complain about health care at all!"
2062,"We are once again in this hotel and once again we promise not to come back, the problems begin when the peak season comes and more guests arrive then there is a total lack of organization The management should manage a subordinate pension and not such a large facility A huge advantage is the hotel's animation, swimming pool and a great children's playroom Kiddos for which there is no competition in other hotels. If you want to relax and don't have children, choose another place in the area."
2063,"This is my second dagger of its kind. First bought from the middle shelf and then ncx , but in 2013 . The stick is working, but it has a design error. Both models have the same problem after a while. If it is a vertically positioned pillar (and this is the manufacturer's specification), it should work perfectly. Senk in that most frames have a pipe for the stick at some angle. This design with all these joints causes the pin, which is pushed in and resisted by two springs, to rub against the sleeve in which it is placed. No greases or specialty oils for the piston, etc. seem to be of any use. The pressure of the mass exerted at an angle causes the piston to rub one wall against the sleeve and rubs off. A man will drive 10 km to the cross and the friction starts again, which makes a sound throughout the frame. When unfolded into the first parts, one side of the piston is completely rubbed off. Generally, for such money (almost 300 PLN) is some kind of defeat. Two different models and the same reaction, and I weigh 72kg so it is rather not known what load."
2064,"there is no better guide ! ! The lectures are very interesting in terms of course name. No regulation in the lectures are just examples of life, it is really worth going because there are a lot of interesting things and I won't say, but I haven't seen so many people on any other humour even though they haven't checked any list! It's worth it because you can find out a few interesting things."
2065,"Kindly and culturally, possible contact by phone or e-mail. I am a patient with episodic bronchial asthma . Unfortunately, the visits are very short, quick, as if made in a hurry and, most of all, very expensive (especially if the visit lasts 5 minutes and focuses on issuing 1 prescription). For any questions and doubts, only brief explanations (as for me, ""selling"" the patient), no additional examinations or advice, apart from the information on how to take the drug. Unfortunately, the downside determines my assessment and I have to give up the care of this doctor."
2066,"A room for a hotel like this is okay. Without unnecessary glamour but also without any shortcomings. In the evening, after the lights were turned off, the party began, which lasted until three in the morning. No one intervened, even though my room was repeatedly visited by drunken feasts. The hotel staff was very passive. Breakfast was low even for such a hotel."
2067,"If you don't like crowds of people and wholesalers of accommodation and artificial food, the Eden Hotel is the place for you. Nice staff with a sincere smile and not trained in training, and this applies both to your manager, as well as the ladies from the reception desk and the ladies from the kitchen (all the staff are young, pretty and nice and energetic people). Food made on the spot - pride - no artificiality - I recommend especially pâtés and cakes. . . Some rooms with a view of the old Jewish cemetery - a magical place . . . I often use this place for business purposes - training . Like any place, it has some drawbacks, but for me it's the CLIMATE that matters most: )"
2068,"Welcome to the Fenix Hotel I have been to for the first time, but in my professional career I travel all over Poland and sleep in many places. In this hotel I've been stolen from me and there are a couple of people. The very approach of the staff to the situation was punishable and two significant hmmm. The thief acted very consciously and knew exactly how to move and where to go for his booty. The case is under investigation, but as for me, the computer logs were prepared but this investigation will be handled by the police. I will certainly write what came next. I DON'T RECOMMEND, MASSACRE, THIEVES."
2069,"Apart from nice service, this hotel does not even deserve 1 star. . . No air conditioning, in the rooms facing fans, which you have to turn off when you leave the room (separate key to ""electricity"" in the room), the smell of old, aerated furniture, carpet and mattresses floats everywhere, in the bathroom we found a toilet without toilet seat board, and the flush was broken. Something like a ""shower cubicle"" with a curtain from a curtain that used to be white, now yellowed and brown. . . Around the hotel you can smell cat urine everywhere, cats run on balconies until the fear of leaving the window open. From what we have noticed, the cats also lived in this hotel, they were fed there by the staff. In the canteen there is no ventilation, you can't even open the window, a man can't even eat quietly because it's sweating. . Not very pleasant. For breakfasts every day the same thing, dried sausages, minced meat, cheese, tomatoes, eggs and milk with flakes. Lunches and dinners were tasty and very varied - you can't get attached here. As for the pool, the reality has nothing to do with the pictures, except maybe at night. . At the bottom, a terrible ford, which can be seen without much effort, is not suitable for people who cannot swim - it is about 2 m deep. In the part of the pool that is closest to the kitchen you can feel a terrible smell, as if from the basement, it is impossible to sit on deckchairs in that area. Cleaning in the rooms is very irregular - the neighbors had garbage bags and bed linen changed 4 times a week, we only 2. And now the best - there are KARALUCHES in the whole hotel. Yes, cockroaches! ! ! In the canteen, in the rooms. . . This vermin is the size of a finger in the hand! ! ! All Poles who stayed in this hotel with us have seen at least a few cockroaches. . . This hotel is a total bottom. . . But the Russians were delighted...) I understand 2 stars, we did not expect miracles, but bugs and cats in the canteen, dirty rooms and the stench of musty everywhere. . . This hotel shouldn't be called a hotel, it should feel the coming fall. I wouldn't recommend it. Luckily, Rhodes itself is beautiful and has alleviated the unpleasant hotel experience, but in order not to be discouraged and not to get upset, I advise you to choose another hotel. Greetings."
2070,"As he added, during the research, information about many parameters are collected, which describe functioning of mitochondria. ""These parameters concern the appearance of mitochondria, their structure, how they move, whether they are fragmented or not. They also describe their functioning, that is their ability to produce ATP. Mitochondria are the units in a cell responsible for the production of ATP, the energy molecule which is used in the cell for most processes, enabling the cell to survive at all,"" he said. ""If we determine the effect of these substances on the mitochondria and the whole cell, it is possible to translate these results into the harmfulness of the substance for the whole body of the smoker. If it turns out that the mitochondria function better than in the case of traditional cigarettes, then the smoker, who uses a new technology, i.e. tobacco heating, may be less exposed to the harmful effects resulting from the toxicity of the substance"" - concluded Więckowski ."
2071,"Hello! I can't say much good (or bad) about Dr. Archimowicz, because san also said little during the visit. The doctor's interview was based on the question: do you pee at night? There were no tests, even commissioned. But it was a prescription for medicines, which I was advised against in the pharmacy, as it later turned out - right. Maybe such a talk about peeing is loose and - above all - human, but it embarrassed me and made me a little bit tired. And it certainly effectively discouraged the specialist from doing so. However, each patient has a different sensitivity and different requirements, so I give a neutral rating."
2072,"I was at your doctor's house in Adameda looking for help with my severe pains in the caudal bone area. He greeted me nervously, that one more patient as if it was my fault, that the lady in the registration of me. Later he looked at the MRI and found me with Tarlov's cysts that were compressing my nerves and hence the pain. In his prescriptions he stated, and I quote: clench your teeth and survive may move! Because they are inoperable. She believed me: (After a year and a half of nonstop siphoning of anti-inflammatory drugs she started looking for help again. She found me in a pain treatment clinic and there the neurologist Dr. Kmieciak, on this weird resonance, diagnosed an already aging fracture of the tumour bone ! ! This was confirmed by a radiologist. Thank you, Doctor, for almost two years of pain! ! ! Now I don't even know what's going to happen to me because the entire tailbone is inflamed and there are necrotic lesions."
2073,"We spent a week at the hotel. We were with our 6-month-old son. Hotel 4 * * * * * . The hotel is a poor value for money. At the lake, paid sun loungers per day per person 10 PLN, the larger one 100 PLN per day. Absurd! In no 4-star hotel in Poland has I met such a fraud ! The path leading to the lake is filled with pebbles, it is very difficult to drive a pram! If the hotel advertises with the slogan ""Here a child is a vip"" should meet at least one of the most important convenience for children. The wheels of our stroller, which was not cheap, are in a lamentable condition. The advantage of the hotel were good breakfasts and dinners, as well as spa treatments. I definitely think that the hotel is not worth the price we paid for a week's stay."
2074,"You can spend time in the hotel. The food is good, you can recommend it. Likewise with cleanliness - rooms, pool and spa in good condition, except for the paint coming off the ceilings and the absence of corners at the pool bells. The only and greatest disadvantage of staying at a Mercure hotel was the service. Unfortunately, the lack of commitment from the staff was very apparent, especially in the spa area. Lack of competence was also visible in the waitress service. They asked the waitress about the difference in dishes in the menu; in response we received her laughter and the answer 'I don't know'. Unfortunately, the service was 1 / 5 in our opinion. Comparing the Mercure hotel with another hotel that also offers SPA services and has 4 stars, we find that the difference between them is huge."
2075,"I've been treating you for about 3 years. With a very good result - no complications . Before that, she was a patient of other doctors. I definitely prefer your doctor. And what are the following comments, maybe the patients have their problems and you have to look at your behavior a little bit than to openly slander you for your mistakes. Let's not make the doctor guilty. It's not a court. I expect culture."
2076,"I'm almost two months after my nose surgery. I guess the swelling's gone down quite a bit, but it feels like it was broken. I'm still the happiest person with a new nose. And I can breathe normally. The doctor did a great job. The nose fits perfectly in my face, I just love it and it had a huge hump, besides the fractures with displacement and an S-shaped septum. Everything healed quickly and the swelling and bruises from the eyes were coming down in a flash. However, everyone reacts individually to such treatments. I recommend it with all my heart! In my opinion, Dr Łątkowski pays enough attention to his patients and has a great approach to them."
2077,"I'm not happy with the visit. To find out anything, you have to ""pull the tongue"". An antipathic person, be rude. Zero contact with the patient. I'm glad he didn't operate on me. Maybe he's a good surgeon, I don't know, but the rest of it's a tragedy. You can go to another doctor with the same or better references and be treated much better."
2078,"The building has this something, unfortunately it has already survived its years. The stink in the room. Reception staff is mediocre, my card was pre-authorized for 2 nights + 3ci as extra. The next day I asked 'em to billing and issue a FV as I leave in the morning. The receptionist once again charged my credit card for 2 nights and the previous amount that was pre-authorized did not cancel, so the pre-authorization lasted 14 days on the account . After a request for clarification by the receptionists , each of them said something different . As a last resort, the check-out lady apologized to me for the error of the receptionist, who instead of finishing the pre-authorization, deleted me again. Such things should not happen in a hotel 5 * ."
2079,unpleasant and spraying operation . . Breakfast and very low level of service . Splashing and impatient waiters . The crew still has a lot to learn. . There's a lot of under-age in the rooms. . . I don't recommend it. . I won't go back there.
2080,": W - 10 TRN I liked to listen and even for such a boring field that I am interested in it sometimes aroused my curiosity, but I had this lecture at an inhuman time of 7.30 am and sometimes I preferred to sleep as you are interested in it you can bring a lot of final colloquiums (2 questions: what is the law and what is a lawsuit) + papers that raise the ratings (minimum 10 pages - gave me a break) . Checking the presence (but rather does not take into account the presence, I know people who did not have any documented presence but have passed) and others lacking tells nice stories from life, how easy it is to get rid of your mother-in-law : wink : even . . . seems mean, but deep down, he's a very nice person (you don't mind, you don't have any problems) . I recommend the Lord gives you a cut retort and doesn't like talking, disturbing or being late (the laggards stand on the first benches but don't take any ' legal responsibility ') . At first it seemed like it was going to be difficult to pass, as there was a lot of material to remember, but what happened at the colloquium was just a student paradise. . . It was like a little bit of a wink: (prepare yourself a multitude of downloads on the wheel) ."
2081,"Typical 3-star hotel. The fourth one was probably added behind the pool. With 4 stars it's only prices that don't match the quality. We'll sleep in the comfort room. A child slept on a sofa that was completely unsuitable for this. An adult experienced torment on it. Heavy, hard quilts, hard pillows. The windows couldn't be opened because the room was above the restaurant and the smells of fat didn't live. I don't know what was supposed to be the leitmotif of the decor, but there is nothing to do with beautiful regional art. It is snowy, in the style of the 80s, the cepeliad at its worst. Nice people. Bialowieza has kept its charm, the hotel has absolutely nothing to do with this charm. I don't understand the delight of this place. It is neither comfortable, nor climatic, nor tasty. It's expensive (prices are higher than in Warsaw in hotels with real 4 stars) and with unnecessary bother. I do not recommend it."
2082,"Swimming pool inactive, for unknown reasons, sauna also. The room is very small with no air conditioning and underfloor heating in the bathroom. hair dryer installed so - that it would not be possible to pull it out without damaging the wall sink.at breakfast a small choice, without the possibility of warm dishes."
2083,"A hotel with a clear conscience I can recommend to everyone. The location of the hotel is sensational, the rooms are clean, perfectly equipped, the beds are very comfortable, the air conditioning is efficient, the view from the balcony to the lake is wonderful. A big advantage of the hotel is its staff - nice and willing to help. Breakfast is very good, the rest and relaxation area is without reservations. Privacy in the hotel is fully preserved - there is no possibility of access to the residential area of outsiders (all entrances and elevator on the card). I'm just wondering a bit about the necessity and the amount of the charge (40 / 70 zł per day) for the use of the hotel car park, the more so as the parking at a price of 40 zł per day is outside the hotel area. I personally believe that this fee should not be."
2084,"My flight was cancelled and the airline offered me accommodation there, at the reception Mr. Thomas behaved very professionally, welcomed us with a smile and gave us all the necessary information. I was at a hotel in Abuja, Nigeria, Italy, Spain and Rome, Airport Hotel Okecie surprised me with a free WiFi connection. The room was clean, white towels. I fully recommend."
2085,"So... . . .the course is generally quite heavy, a lot of people go out in the beginning. Mr. Pawel can explain, he can also require : ) During the semester there are 7 cards and 7 homeworks, to pass the card you have to bring the homework, the product of the points pr. dom . and the card must be at least 0.5 (scores from 0 to 1) . Then the circle and the exam . In order to have a tested exam you have to pass the wheel and all the sheets of paper. During the session there is always a big queue to Mr. Paul : ) However, I must admit that this course was quite interesting and ... in its own way pleasant, although you really had to learn."
2086,"Absolutely not. My problem with which I decided to come to this doctor has been going on for a year. She found me at his office by order and I guess I'll never listen to anybody else about doctors again. When I finally managed to make an appointment for my first visit, which was not easy anyway (she had to specify on the phone what the visit was supposed to be about - a little bit pointless, she would prefer that the doctor himself find out what was wrong with me and not based on my guesses) she was quite satisfied with me. The doctor seemed to be professional, very kind and polite. With each subsequent visit, my confidence in his competence diminished. Already on the first visit she was given m antidepressants and millions of ointments (including painkillers) - the doctor said vulvodynia, although I was not sure if he listened to the fact that her symptoms do not coincide with mine. But good, she thought I was probably right. Unfortunately, with time, my condition did not improve, but on the contrary, it was getting worse. With each subsequent visit (and let's not hide, visits to the cheapest ones are not) she heard m "" You do not feel any improvement yet, but I can already see her. ( . . . ) We will only increase the dose of drugs. ( . . . ) Next time you have a pain attack, please apply a painkiller ointment. ""I'm finally getting tired of something like this. Pain relief ointment and only temporary pain avoidance will not solve the problem. She decided to go to another doctor. The doctor, where I was, said that I should go to a urologist, because I have a cyst in the vulva region of the urethra, which a specialist should see. Currently I am after two treatments trying to remove the cyst, which is recurring in the form of an abscess. There is a chance for surgery. The doctor who came to me said that the problem had been untreated for too long and he was in severe shock when he heard about the treatment of this doctor. I am very disappointed and angry that she wasted me so much money, time and obviously health. I wonder if I wouldn't go back there again and explain why there wasn't a treatment appropriate to the disease. I am very disappointed I do not recommend to anyone, even for ordinary visits of women without major gynaecological problems."
2087,"An attempt to transfer the idea of the Coalition to the regional level was made in the autumn of this year by establishing the Silesian Cervical Cancer Coalition. According to the professor, similar initiatives should also be developed in other regions, and they must be followed by local activities in municipalities and districts. ""This requires a concerted cooperation of doctors, community nurses and local institutions. For example, social welfare centres can be involved in promoting free of charge cytological examinations"" - believes the professor . In his opinion, women from poor families are most often disregarded by the examinations . Professor quoted the example of Tychy, where the mortality rate from cervical cancer is among the lowest in the region . Professor . For 33 years Poręba was associated with the gynaecology and obstetrics clinic operating in the city. Currently, after the withdrawal of the clinic from Tychy by the Silesian Medical University, professor is a consultant of the gynaecological department of the Tychy hospital."
2089,"I think there are people who want to go to a gynaecologist mainly for psychological and even psychiatric advice. Good contact with the patient is important in every specialization but especially in these specialties like gynecology it is important to be objective, to be able to give important information important to the patient who has to use it and not to forget it five minutes after leaving the office. As far as these issues are concerned, the Doctor is irreplaceable here because she gives specific information, not fantasies, and for the forgotten, she writes on a piece of paper. A visit to the doctor's office is not a conversation with a friend or an opportunity to unload your frustrations. I prefer the doctor's objectivity to the lack of precision, which leads to the fact that you do not know what you have come to the doctor for. I recommend it."
2090,"I have had psoriasis for a very long time. I went through many surgeries and without me it was 'treated' in them. I am only after the first visit to the doctor but I cannot have any negative comments. He explained to me exactly the course of treatment, ointment and other medicines how to use, he dictated exactly how to use them so as not to confuse them (I have 4 of them in the same jars). He explained the purpose of the exposure, the price of the treatment and the medicines. It is not important to me whether the doctor is in a great mood or not, what matters to me is knowledge and professionalism, which at the moment I can not take into account your doctor, he was relatively nice during the visit, so I'm surprised by the comments after which she set herself rather not pleasant visit. I hope that with the next checks and a little bit of them I will be able to speak as positively about Dr . Rostalski ."
2091,"In its Consumer Intelligence Series analysis, PwC surveyed over a thousand travelers from the leisure and business segments. We don't send stupidity: ) The aim of the study was to find out guests' preferences for hotel loyalty programs and loyalty to the hotel as a brand. The more interesting conclusions are as follows: - differences in millennium preferences do not differ significantly from other groups of consumers (which is different from what Em wrote earlier, using the Revinate blog) - the main factor in choosing a loyalty program is the subjectively perceived value of the points gained, although in the leisure group as many as 58% of respondents did not use the points gained - the way of involving guests with a hotel brand is very similar in groups interested in leisure and millenniums - how are the points realized?"
2092,"Perhaps the investor himself has changed his hotel plans, which may be related to the general, not very favorable economic situation. The progress of works is also not visible in the modernisation and extension of the Grand Hotel in Łódź, which is not surprising, however, because they were to start after the hotel in Warsaw was put into operation. If the works start in the spring this year, it is not surprising that they were to start after the hotel in Warsaw was put into operation. If the works start in the spring of this year, Prudential will have a chance to become the second luxury hotel in Warsaw, after Bristol, which has just joined the Luxury Collection chain. If it is extended to 2015, it may be overtaken by the European hotel, whose modernisation and renovation is expected to start in the coming months and last until 2015. The European hotel is to return to the market as part of the Raffles chain. Thus, in 2015 as many as three luxury hotels may operate in the capital city market. Will they find visitors? They should, because the launch of direct flights to Middle Eastern countries by Quatar Airways and Emirates Airlines, promises to increase inbound traffic, including tourism by a more affluent group."
2093,"I have cancelled the visit twice, and when I finally managed to get it with my daughter, it turned out that I was taken in by an assistant who couldn't refer to the doctor's earlier recommendations and still simply cancels it for the visit. On the next visit at Mrs. Wary's I get a recommendation to remove two teeth from the child, while in accordance with previous recommendations, we have already removed three, each of the three other specialists with whom she consulted because she did not want to leave the child without teeth knocked on the head for such a diagnosis. Unfortunately, she recommended me earlier to a colleague who, after a similar adventure with the proposal of pulling out half of the teeth, quickly changed the specialist. I strongly advise against it."
2094,"Hello, when she found out I was pregnant she wanted me to be led by an experienced doctor. So she signed up for a visit to Dr. Bystrzejewski suggesting herself with opinions on the internet. I can now say that all my appointments were made in a hurry because every time there was a delay of at least one hour because the doctor was always late. Such a situation should not happen, taking into account that each visit must be properly paid for. During the whole pregnancy I had about 13 visits after which the doctor did not even remember my name. With a clear conscience I can say that the sympathetic doctor conducted the examination in a gentle manner. Unfortunately, the visits lasted a few minutes in total, the doctor forgot to write prescriptions because he was in an eternal rush. The worst thing is that with this hurry and distraction, the doctor had to interpret the results of the examination which could result in damage to the fetus. When after my overzealousness finally came out that the results are bad and it is because of the doctor's inattention, she did not even hear me apologize. I do not recommend it."
2095,"We spent a couple of days here and we have the feeling that ""maybe"" in a couple of years time this hotel will have 3 stars currently is on the level of 1, 5 stars and it's a shame because the building is beautiful and finished interestingly with a great park, but at this end. Even owning a spa doesn't change our opinion. The 2 hour wait for a hotel room is a clear example of this and this is one of the many that I will not mention. I don't recommend this hotel to a person used to a nice and experienced service. Sorry, ((( Dog. The owner is extremely rude and give a rude gift to the guests! ! !"
2096,"Hotel: located outside the center of Krakow, however, with very good access to both the center and the airport. The hotel provides free access to the centre of Krakow twice a day. Prices for accommodation are competitive in comparison with other 4 * hotels in Krakow. Rooms: Standard furnished with double bed, sofa, television, minibar, safe, internet, telephone, coffee machine, kettle, bathroom with shower. Room: heated / air-conditioned. After switching off the heating and setting the air conditioning to max in the room was still hot. Breakfast: good, large selection Attractions at the hotel: child-friendly hotel, the downside is the swimming pool (cold and deep 1, 50 - 2, 35m) and no mini fitness center service: revelation, every request has been met whether it was a cleaner, from the restaurant or reception. Overall, the hotel is really worth recommending."
2097,"Pluses: Attractions and facilities for children (playgrounds, playgrounds, playroom, animations, mini-discos, fireplace, mini zoo, etc.). ) - super pool adapted even for a crawling child (additional paddling pool with slides) Feeding - b . good (all meals in the form of buffet including lunch - there is no saving after proposing some dinner. ) Attractions for adults were also a nice touch of this stay. Generally, you can not leave the center and have a great time. Minus: Small rooms, no air conditioning."
2098,"A small room, but clean. It's even good in comparison to other Ibis, because it has a normal bathroom and not a shower in the room. The air-conditioning - efficient, wifi - also. The hotel is very well located, 10 minutes walk from the Market Square. Upon arrival at the reception desk immediately and without asking me a question, they downloaded me from my credit card for the stay and parking (usually I pay at check-out). When I leave, also without asking me a question, they did me probably ""fast checkout"". ...because he got an invoice in a pdf to an email. They ask far too little at this reception desk - they know everything better? Breakfast (pricelistically - 36 PLN per person, I just had it included in the night) - as well as in other Accor / Orbis hotels in the form of a Swedish table, so (theoretically) you can eat at will. But only theoretically. Most of the products are inedible: the ""cheese"" cheese, probably even scrambled eggs were from egg-like ""eggs"" . He tempted em to ""apple pie according to grandma's recipe. "" . And I also failed to murder her."
2100,"Maybe I'll start by saying my name is Tom and I'm a gambler. Patrician was my individual therapist as well as he was running group activities in the place where I was starting to get out of my addiction ... It is very difficult for me to describe, assess and find words that would describe his contribution to my health ... and this is because the contribution was simply huge and actually indescribable: ) It all started in the autumn of 2015 when I was sent to the centre after several years of playing in a deeply depressed state, on the verge of mental exhaustion, with huge debts ... ""Life or death"" - these are the words of Patrician, which I will remember for the rest of my life and which he said, when he found out that a few months after the earlier interrupted therapy, he started to play 'em again ... Words that he said with full responsibility knowing my condition ... Through which he also knew that I could always go back to therapy and call him ... ... and he called 'em. The moment he actually realized to himself that I only have two choices. From the moment he started therapy again, Patricia was the man he trusted em with. He trusted 'em 100%. . . He was and is my mentor and guide (here, sure, reading, smiling and a little reddening) . In individual contact, it turned out that we broadcast on ""one wave"" and we had similar problems in life. Thus, in the initial phase of therapy, each meeting poured a lot of hope into my heart that I can get out of my addiction and my depressive state and enjoy life: ) ( because he's done it. ) Each of our meetings has always brought something new, innovative for me. It wasn't easy ... The trust that Patrician gave me paid off and resulted in the fact that today I lead a very happy and active life free from addictions, full of joy from the smallest things: ) With Patrician, although our therapeutic meetings are not yet held, we are in constant contact with him... who I appreciate very much :) On the way, it turned out that we have similar interests, sense of humor and we simply understand each other: )"
2102,"Despite the dynamic growth in Rio de Janeiro, which will host the World Cup next year and the 2016 Summer Olympics, there is a shortage of hotels of an appropriate standard. Currently, the city has 25,000 hotel rooms meeting the requirements of the International Olympic Committee. This is only 3,000 fewer rooms than the IOC requirements as of 5 August 2016, the day the Games begin. Brazilians are confident that they will meet the challenge and the number of hotel rooms will not only comply with IOC requirements, but will even exceed them. According to the analytical company STR Global, at the threshold of 2013 in Brazil, there were hotel projects with 18,600 rooms in Brazil (the size equals about 10% of the current market), including 1,900 rooms in Rio de Janeiro."
2103,"The Doctor has given us almost 1 hour of his time. It is a great rarity for this type of specialists who have so many patients that the visits are very short and hard to get out of them, except in a hurry. In the meantime, we have been quietly explained what our daughter's disease is about, how to live with her and how to treat her. With great patience, but also with professionalism, the doctor answered our questions. It was a good visit and despite the stress resulting from the severe bladder disease of our daughter, we feel safer because we know that after the visit everything is under control. So we recommend."
2104,"We spent a week in Eleon with two children (13 months and 5 years) from TUI Poland since 23rd . 05 - 30 . 05 . 2014 . A comfortable room, clean without vermin, good food but no seafood . Bar and restaurant service in Poland, all very nice. Swimming pools super water suitable for bathing , clean . Water from the water supply and mineral water suitable for the preparation of meals for babies, the center is clean although there is only one trash can in the beach and garden. Small sandy beach with a bit of pebbles, not crowded, beach chairs in the olive grove. Enough sun loungers by the beach as well as the swimming pools. Beach towels exchanged daily for free. The rooms in the garden area have no view of maybe and in the evening you can smell the sewerage, this is a big minus because there is a bar and animation scene. As for the animations offered by the hotel is unfortunately a very low level - the same repertoire every week and only music (no cabaret, sketches, etc.) hotel animators do not offer practically any attractions during the day at the pool. The offer of the mini club below criticism. Perhaps when the animators of individual travel agencies arrive it will be better : - ) It is worth renting a car at the hotel, the cost of renting a car for the whole day with gasoline is ok . 80 euro ( Skoda Fabia with white roof : - ) ) . It is better to get gasoline (about 1, 6 euros per litre, oil 1, 3 euros / l) immediately because on the west coast with stations brittle, and when they found us it turned out to be closed. However, on the northeastern stations every few hundred meters : - ) We did not take advantage of the tours offered by the office, we visited the whole island on our own account. The island has a beautiful view, but the weather is capricious, there was even rain: - ) . Probably the full season will be better, but reportedly the temperatures are up to 45 degrees C. In our time, the temperatures reached over 30 degrees Celsius, but it was not so noticeable especially on sun loungers in the olive grove at the beach, where the loungers are under the trees giving shade : - ) We generally recommend that if you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them."
2105,"""The results of our research in a series of five papers have been published in world-renowned scientific journals. On April 3, 2018, our latest publication was published in the scientific journal Scientific Reports of the Nature Publishing Group, the world's most prestigious scientific publisher,"" she added. Researchers from the Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IRZiBŻ PAN) in Olsztyn also conduct research on human skin tissues stored in the tissue bank. ""Interestingly, our pilot and very preliminary studies carried out on human skin samples confirm the observations in mouse skin. It turned out that in post-traumatic tissues (scar tissue) there is a higher activity of + scar gene + Foxn1 in comparison to the uninjured / healthy skin"" - described Barbara Gawrońska - Kozak. One of the current directions of the Olsztyn research group is to demonstrate the relationship between individual age and Foxn1 activity."

2107,"MISCELLANEOUS The above text (for INTEX solar mats) does not give all details . I bought 'em tempted by the advertisement 2 such mats for swimming pool 3 , 66 m diameter and pumps approx . 1000l / h . After filling the mats with water, they were VERY SHOULDING. But the worst thing is that the strongest bends - the bends are right at the water inlets and outlets. This means that the water cannot flow freely through the mat and does NOT work: - (Even 3 times stronger pump cannot handle these bends. The second problem is VERY big problem with bleeding the mats. Only the connection to the running water from the hose pushed the air through. Conclusion - the second time he would not buy these mats. They just look pretty."
2108,"To remain objective I will give examples : 1 . With a small siege, I got 'em a room with a growling outside the window of the device most likely a pump or an air conditioner . 2 . No marking in the fitness area . . . . . . .and the sauna is behind 8 doors and several bends. . . . . . .but the utility room is perfectly described. . . 3 . The porter, despite being asked to indicate a ""good"" place in the garage the next day, could not leave it. 4 . The architectural object was located 40cm on the ""window"" of my room . Avoid ."
2109,"If you believe the live information of this service, which displays the number of rooms sold, then a similar distribution structure takes place in most major Polish cities. And yes and no . Unfortunately, there is no clear answer. All the more so because the hotels that I mean are doing quite well. I also have no reason to think that the others are worse. If giving the market to the booking platforms is a well-thought-out strategy, including an alternative plan, then it may be justified in some framework. Sometimes it is necessary, or even the most advantageous solution. I can easily imagine facilities that calculate OTA as the dominant seller. Then it is combined with other operational activities - not investing in marketing or expanding the sales department."
2110,"Currently, there are over 2,200 Super 8 facilities on the US, Canadian and Chinese markets. The presentation of the new concept took place during the International Hotel Investment Forum held in Berlin. A year ago, at the previous edition of the IHIF, the President of the Wyndham Hotel Group, Eric Danziger and partner of Colliers International, Alex Kloszewski, signed an agreement to introduce the Super 8 brand to Poland. At least 10 such facilities are to be built in organisational cooperation with Colliers International and the Polish construction company Unibep Group."
2111,"A hotel with an aquapark, so what is most important in a room? ? ? Dryer ! ! ! Note 1 the dryer is available for the whole hotel! ! ! ! The bathroom has no cosmetics (no gel or shampoo) and no heater to dry the towels: (Breakfast is weak, I do not know if it depends on the season? Just tomatoes and hams, some cheese. . . Any advantages? I guess it's just nice service in the restaurant. The staff of the aquapark does not work with a large number of customers and it turns out that after leaving the swimming pool (dressed up, wet) the hotel guests have to stand in line so that someone can let them through the gates : ( Tragedy, unfortunately I do not recommend : ("
2112,There is no approach to children. Before the examination she had the child undressed and then for a few minutes she was writing on the comp. The child started to cry in the cold and the doctor told her that the examination does nothing but cry. No comment on the result of heart echoes and all this for 150 PLN in luxmeda!
2113,"We were in Rome with friends in the second week of NovemberWe wanted the hotel to be well located because we planned to visit Rome on the first day, the Vatican on the second day. Unfortunately, at the beginning there was a lot of confusion about the airport transfer fee, which we had to pay, but this was due to a late response from the hotel. The answer about the transfer fee was given to us when we were already on the plane. He explained everything and compensated us for it in the return transfer. The hotel itself has a very good location, all the attractions are in very close proximity and is located in the centre of Rome. Despite the fact that we are not typical hikers, we have managed to cope with it. The hotel is clean, cleaned daily. Breakfast is tasty and fresh, everyone will find something for themselves. Very friendly staff, special thanks to Mr. Giuseppe who explained the transfer. Near the hotel there are many small restaurants which offer really not expensive and tasty meals, there are many cafés and several small supermarkets. I sincerely recommend the hotel for people who are going to Rome with a view to sightseeing."
2114,"The hotel chose 'em because of their location - close to the market! Unfortunately, the conditions are not the best: cold room, located on the ground floor above the underground car park so that you could keep the frozen food - no carpet in the room, air conditioning, loud - did not blow warm air and no radiators, TV set, small, flush toilet was leaking. I understand that there is no kettle in a 2-star kettle, but to make two glasses is not a scandal! In addition, only a decent shower and a comfortable bed! 40 PLN for a parking lot per day is a bit too much - in the 3-star one it is 30 PLN."
2116,"Average hotel. The rooms are not very big, but it is understandable because of the historical location and fit. The very organization of the event on site at a high level thanks to the room manager . The managerial service that really represents the hotel owner leaves much to be desired. I have a comparison with other famous hotels (Arlamow, Marine, etc.) in the country and Ryn is the worst against this background. It is not acceptable to try to pull a business client. The lack of flexibility and care for each client puts a very negative shadow on this beautiful and historic hotel. Please email me for details. Greetings"
2117,"Evaluation : avoid like fire ! ! ! The lady on the exercises solves the tasks with a dizzying speed, whose level of difficulty is comparable to that of the script, but on the colloquials the matter gets a bit complicated, here it is not so simple - the tasks are fancy, they are not in the script. On an exam it is easy, because someone else arranges the tasks. : ! :"
2118,"In a la carte restaurant with 3 busy tables, the waiting time for the card is 0,5 h + . Once we see the approach of one of the eight waiters, he/she behaves very arrogantly, especially one lady with blond hair. The cleaning ladies, in turn, are a total drama. While on Sunday the lady orders you to leave quickly, because she has to clean up what in a four-star hotel should not take place, then on other days it comes at 16, or not at all, claiming that she was hanging ""do not disturb"" the door, which is not true. One day, when she didn't come at all, we had to take clean towels from the cleaners' locker. However, at the reception desk ladies very nice, I have nothing to reproach. Besides, the food is still medium, so that's all right."
2119,"I strongly advise against visiting Dr. Mincewicz. The visit with a small child lasted about 15 minutes and at that time nurses with prescriptions for signature entered the office, which took about 5 minutes, so the whole visit lasted about 10 minutes. During this time the doctor diagnosed atopic dermatitis in the child. However, he did not give the reasons for this condition and did not indicate how to treat it, he only gave the phone number of his doctors friends to consult with them on the further course of treatment. After the visit, for which I paid 100 zloty, he expected something more and did not find out anything more than what he knew before entering the office . Your doctor's knowledge may be sufficient for adults, but he cannot deal with the problems of small children at all. Atopic dermatitis has outgrown the possibilities, experience and knowledge of the doctor - a provincial consultant in allergology and court expert in allergology and internal diseases. I strongly advise against visiting and consulting the doctor."
2120,"We were in this apartment in February 2014 the apartment itself is ok but not fully equipped, no water kettle, no pot lids but the biggest problem is that there is a four-burner electric cooker with an oven but unfortunately you can only use one burner or oven otherwise the traffic jams will turn off and then you have to go to the owner who is very not nice of course we got a glowtor that too many things brought us and therefore blows up the traffic jams. The situation was repeated several times and in the end we did not use the kitchen because there was no other possibility. The owners do not allow to open windows in the apartments! ! ! which is a massacre, especially when at the beginning we wanted to cook on our own and turning on the extractor turned off the lights. Another big problem is the heating, which for a week was turned on twice and for a few hours the towels smelled musty and ski clothes couldn't completely dry out. Shoe dryer is unfortunately another disadvantage of this settlement is yes, but not heated shoes not dried out after a week smelled of moisture massacre. In Tui's offer it was written that there is an internet connection all right but additionally paid 15 Euros and again a small surprise because despite the fee almost did not work on the question why I do not have a net they heard us with so already here. The resort has a swimming pool, maybe a swimming pool but the stench of chlorine is unstoppable until the entrance to the building is baking in the eyes so we also forgot to visit this super spa. The test of white gloves will be carried out by the owner and you will be counted all the pieces, cups, plates and advice to report at once, for example, not quite a clean bathroom or dirty plates because such happens dirty on the floor because in the end you will still have to clean it yourself. When we arrived in the bathroom there was a basket on the net with a bag into which we threw 10 petals when we left, we pulled out a bag underneath the basket was a hideous dirty owner said that if we do not wash it, we will be charged 50 euros for cleaning is just one big joke. Every year we go to Austria is our first stay in Italy but we did not survive such a failure anywhere. It was supposed to be a great stay but unfortunately it is not cool to ride with wet gloves or shoes! ! ! ! ! I really wouldn't recommend the nerve damage."
2121,"Eau de Toilette with not very original smell neither pretty nor ugly. It holds seemingly for a long time but very poorly (to feel it after a long time but only close up) barely felt after spraying. In douglas the price for 110 ml is 270 zł so in my opinion it is definitely not worth the price. If someone likes such classics it's really better to buy a GiO, at least it smells good at all. I bought m for 160 with a package of 60 ml if it wasn't for the fact that my boyfriend said he liked it because he had a sample he would definitely buy me something else."
2122,"Unfortunately, I had a chance to have dinner at the Novotel Hotel. At the beginning not very experienced waiter's service (he is shaking around the room and probably ashamed to approach ; ) ) . The food felt terrible that everything is heated up and prepared without any care. For the first course he took em hamburger, unfortunately, the meat was certainly ready and frozen as for the rest of the ingredients I have no objections. For dessert, I decided to order 'em an apple pie where they were cheated because it was a bought cake from a market heated either in some weak oven or quickly put into the microwave . Generally speaking, I cannot recommend a restaurant"
2123,"Cheap. No more advantages . Disadvantages: dirty, smells not only of cigarettes, but also of thousands of previous guests who left behind mushrooms, mould and mess in carpets and bathrooms. The place has not been renovated for 30 years. We didn't even enter the restaurant because we met the cooks mainly on a cigarette under the ""hotel"". You will surely find something better in the area. Kłodzko isn't great, even if you have to stay 30 km away it really pays off, because here you can probably catch everything from mycosis to scabies and lice. A nightmare!"
2124,"The doctor is just being nice and really the most and most willing to talk about vitamin D . The examination lasted very shortly and according to the doctor everything with the child is ok . Unfortunately, during the visit to the hospital, the little girl had her head bruises done and it turned out that during the birth she was underoxidized and had a stroke. In addition, the pediatrician in the hospital noticed at the first examination that the child has a positional asymmetry and rehabilitation will be needed. At the visit she was at a private LuxMed clinic. It was our first and last time with this doctor."
2125,"Plus . Good breakfast, nice service ladies at the reception helpful, good location. And besides, disappointment for such a price. . . . .dirty carpet in the room, dirty walls, scratched furniture from the Holiday, the other day waited 10 minutes for hot water in the shower, I didn't live to see it. . . . .not recommended."
2126,"Since she did not stay in the hotel but only used the restaurant, let me assess the restaurant itself. The restaurant is a place where you can find a lot of information about the restaurant, and where you can find a lot of information about the restaurant, and where you can find a lot of information about the restaurant, and where you can find a lot of information about the restaurant: - Tuscan tomato soup has nothing to do with Polishness - cream of boletus for my feeling of ""boletus"" made of powder with chopped bread in the form of toasts - no old Polish broth - no possibility to offer children something to eat / only fries / - generally not very tasty dishes As soon as guests enter, so after receiving meals quickly disappear. . . . in the restaurant cool, medium quality service. . ."
2127,"Encouraged by many positive opinions, I made an appointment with Dr. Zwinczewska on Ruczaj. Unfortunately, it seems that it is not always worth following the opinions of other people. Maybe she was an exception, but here's how my visit went: in the clinic spent about 3 hours, but on the conversation with Dr. Zwinczewska spent maybe 5 minutes. Please do not be guided by the hours set on the portal, because you still have to wait an hour for the visit to start. The system looks like it takes a few people at a time, it has the receptionists do the tests and the whole visit takes place in several parts. Taking care of so many people at the same time, nobody is able to take good care of all the patients and so it happened in my case. So what if she is nice and smiling at the same time, if there were a few unpleasant situations along the way, one examination was done three times, the doctor herself was distracted, she told me something that did not happen, she kept entering and leaving the office. She gave a piece of paper with the names of the drops and recommended tests to the receptionist who could not explain to me why I should take these drops and what these tests are for. . . I also had to ask the optician for a certificate of the degree of my vision impairment, because I wanted to press my expensive glasses on the spot. If this is the professionalism of a private visit performed by Dr. Zwinczewska, then I will thank you and I will not expose myself to so much stress. I definitely do not recommend ."
2128,"More than 139,000 rooms in 869 hotels were under construction in November 2011, and different stages of preparation for construction in Europe, according to the Construction Pipeline Report prepared by STR Global. A year earlier, in November 2010, 732 hotels with 124,348 rooms were at various stages of construction in Europe. In November this year, the largest number of hotels in Europe were in the exclusive segment (Upscale). 30,369 rooms in the hotels in this segment accounted for 20, 1 of all hotel projects under construction and planned. The higher segment invariably takes first place in terms of participation in new projects - in November this year. In November last year, the share of rooms under construction amounted to 21.3% of all rooms under construction. Out of seven segments identified in the STR Global research, three more had a share greater than 10% of all rooms under construction and planned. These were: comfort segment (Upper Midscale) - 19, 2% and 26,726 rooms, non-classified (Unaffiliated) - 19, 2% and 26,755 rooms and the highest segment (Upper Upscale) - 15, 0% and 20,802 rooms.

2129,I ordered a room and I slept in the basement the price was cosmic for 3 days more than 600 zloty I do not recommend to anyone that we were deceived by anything more the guy from the reception desk had six that I had no place to sleep because it would end otherwise I greet the shit. . . hostel
2130,"Last year, Eve found me browsing the Internet and looking for a dietician to help me with Hashimoto's disease. The fact that she is struggling with this disease convinced me to her and I do not regret it. First of all: Eve is a wonderful person and a professional in every way. She has a very high level of knowledge (supported by medical knowledge), requires detailed research but (and most importantly) she listens to her patients. In good conscience I recommend her. All the more so to people struggling with autoimmune diseases and insulin resistance, but you can come to Ewa with every disease her knowledge is so enormous that she can handle everything."
2131,"We got a room in the so-called Stable. It was so stuffy in the room that we were floating away afterwards. The windows were looking out onto the noisy courtyard. And a place commonly chosen for smoking. After the first night she asked me to change the room. The lady tried to pacify me. Since she did not give in to me, we were offered another room. The location was much better without a double bed, however, what we wanted . It turned out there was no such room in the whole castle. . . She was to wait until the next day, when the wedding guests would leave. The next day she went to the reception desk, again I had to explain why, etc. And again the lady to whom absolutely nobody passed our request offered us the same room as before."
2132,"Despite efforts to improve the situation, the pace of issuing visas leaves much to be desired. What do our industry organisations say? Either nothing, or they talk about it in a very weak voice. So either they are weak, or they prefer to deal with other issues, mostly their own, instead of industry problems. Photo: Atlantic City boardwalk in New Jersey in summer 2011. Atlanic City, which is considered the ""gambling capital of the East Coast"". The number of tourists has been falling for several years, and thus also the revenue."
2133,"She was at this hotel with a group of friends in June 2018. She wanted to warn everyone: the hotel was terrible, in front of the hotel stinking rubbish containers, tons of rubbish that nobody cleans. Breakfast - drama: stinky ground meat. yellow cheese and inedible bread, nothing more - every day the same. Everyone bought and brought their own breakfast to the restaurant. The owner completely disrespects the guests, you can not ask for any document proving the various fees that the hotel charges: air conditioning, safe, or purchase anything at the hotel. Generally a massacre."
2134,"The concentration of the ""traced"" particles will be announced by the participants of the action during special information and health actions. They will take place on March 15th or 22nd in all towns visited by patrols. During the action you will be able to take advantage of free medical tests, get medical advice, measure blood pressure and blood sugar levels. In some locations, free spirometric tests will also be performed, allowing for early detection of bronchial diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is, among other things, a result of inhaling particles. Patrols and health actions are held in cooperation with the International Medical Students' Association IFMSA - Poland, which is a partner of the Particle Tracers campaign. The equipment for measuring the level of particulate matter has been made available by 3M company and the Scientific Circle for Environmental Protection of Warsaw University of Technology, which are also partners of the initiative."
2135,"The hotel was not the first choice, but the lack of places in Novotel Centrum, caused us to book a room in it. At first it seemed that the only advantage would be the price (twice as low). It turned out that the hotel had more to offer than we thought it would. Excellent hotel service, clean and nice rooms, which is not always standard, especially in older foreign hotels of the Accor chain. A very good breakfast. As someone likes it, it's quite an extensive TV package and an unprecedentedly fast internet. In addition to that, there is a huge parking lot (unfortunately, paid for). It also turned out that the distance from and to the Old Town is to be covered on a Saturday evening walk, and if someone did not like to walk, the taxi cost 17 - 20 PLN. The downside, but it's really small, is the external appearance of the hotel, which is slightly ""rubbing the mouse""."
2136,"When she was pregnant with her second child, she regularly went to the clinic, where the doctor receives ( NFZ ) Each visit lasted 3 minutes and each examination 30 seconds. On the day of the birth it turned out that I had an untreated inflammation, which ended up for my baby (fortunately) only with long hospital treatment after the birth and administration of antibiotics. The first question the midwife who examined me on the day of childbirth was - who was leading you and why didn't he recommend treatment? It was the effect of the unprofessional approach of the doctor to the patient, that every examination was superficial, inaccurate and careless. - For this I have a huge regret: ("
2137,"An excellent doctor. Very cordial, full of empathy, absolutely professional, gentle. He devotes a lot of attention and patience to his patients. He seems to be very competent and thus inspires trust. Since she spent some time in the oncology department, I know that all his patients have exactly the same feelings - he is a doctor by vocation. I also know that he enjoys a very good reputation and respect in the medical community. It certainly makes you feel safe in his hands. Especially young women may be a little bit intimidated by the fact that the doctor is b . handsome :) but certainly the personality of dr . Basty helps to overcome his shyness."
2138,"In 2005 she came to see a doctor for brain tumor exposure. The doctor claimed that it was a gamma knife, and as it later turned out, it was a simple linear accelerator that uses a different kind of radiation. That's what the doctor should know. But whatever, because it wasn't the worst. After the procedure she did not get any recommendations (the doctor assured that there will be no side effects). At that time she didn't know that, but nowadays I know that normally after radiotherapy a patient should be recommended to take steroids if something was wrong. Then I had no idea about it. After all, it is the doctor who is the treatment and the patient can only rely on it. About 3 months after the treatment she was walking around with a headache and when she tried to contact the doctor, he cut himself off completely. He did not answer the phone calls from me or from my parents. I'll add that he took money for the surgery itself. The effect of all this was that as a result of untreated swelling (at first she didn't even know I had it) I suffered damage to motor neurons in my frontal lobe, which resulted in paresis and which unfortunately I am experiencing until today. All I had to do was to order further treatment. If the doctor didn't want to do it himself, he could just tell her to go to another doctor. I have a great regret, because before the procedure she was a fully fit person. Today is different. I warn you not to do the irradiation with this gentleman."
2139,"First of all, the service is nice and accessible, and when it comes to spa treatments, there are no words to describe how wonderful they are. You can relax and unwind a lot. Eating at a very high level. Rooms also. Really worth spending at least a few days in this hotel, I recommend."
2140,"I had a chance to stay in this hotel for 5 nights. But I'm a little disappointed because I think this hotel deserves a Max one * . When she stayed in a two-star hotel, there were better standards. The lack of a kettle was annoying, especially at this time of year. . . With a week's stay, it's a big inconvenience. There was practically no internet, i.e. wifi, but when you managed to get a connection, it was so slow that no pages were loading in. And at the end of my stay, that is on Friday, I had training until 12 noon and asked me at the reception desk to extend the day by up to one hour because I did not want to take my luggage to the training, unfortunately, the lady at the reception desk in a rather rude way refused where in other hotels it never happened to me. The only advantage was the cleanliness of the rooms (although the furniture is already a bit worn out) and the Restaurant is undoubtedly the advantage of this place. Unfortunately it was my first and last stay in this hotel."
2141,"And business and family. And in summer and winter. There is always good and there is no shortage of attractions. The best stay was on Christmas many years ago. The kitchen was at the highest level and so was the service. Besides, no matter what the occasion, the baths are the best!"
2142,"""Polyglutamine diseases are rare diseases. Before the first symptoms appear, people with a genetic mutation usually do not know that they will get sick. Therefore, genetic testing is most often performed only on children of sick parents. The test detects the mutation and the children may only know that in approx. In 20 years they will be sick. But there is no drug that could somehow prevent such a fate"" - regrets Stroynowska - Czerwińska. Scientists must not only learn the exact mechanisms of action of non-coding RNA, but also answer the question how to deliver such drugs to the body. If nerve cells are susceptible to mutations, then small non-coding RNAs will have to be delivered to the brain, which is problematic even by the presence of the blood-brain barrier."
2143,"Nice, cultured and tactful. Besides, very gentle in research. Pregnancy was without any complications so I do not know how it works in extreme situations. Maybe a little too reticent. She was a bit surprised by the end of the pregnancy because she heard that she should be under increased control then and I had appointments every 3 weeks despite the transferred pregnancy. Fortunately, nothing disturbing was happening. Your doctor's opinion was as positive as possible, however, during the second pregnancy I may be able to find a doctor who will provide more information: )"
2144,"I got to see the doctor in two weeks, when the others were giving me three months' visits. The professional diagnosis and long term treatment gave me the opportunity to avoid surgery, although I know that he is also an excellent neurosurgeon performing complex surgeries also on the open brain. Traditional knowledge combined with Chinese medicine (the use of acupuncture) gives it great opportunities for effective treatment, which unfortunately, there are not many doctors. Its dedication to treating patients makes the offices full of people from different parts of the country ready to wait for consultations. Keep it up, Doctor! !"
2145,"The city of Suzhou, located just 45 minutes by train from Shanghai, also saw a 4.0% drop in attendance. In Suzhou, also known as ""Venice of the East"", due to the many historical canals and temples, room rates rose by 2.0% and the number of rooms by 5.5%. The increase in hotel supply and the development of the real estate market in all these cities is a result of the development of local economies. The chain of development of hotel rooms presented in one of the graphs indicates that the supply will increase in all these cities. The cities of Sanya (50.1%) and Xiamen (25.9%) will see an above average growth."
2146,"I think Dr. Nawrocki is an excellent specialist. He's found breast cancer in my mother. During the ultrasound he said it was a malignant cancer. Other doctors did not make a diagnosis without a histopathological examination of the tumor. He found it after the ultrasound and he was right. The tests confirmed what he said. I was also on the ultrasound of pregnancy - twice. Like he said, everything was fine, the sex worked too: ) I recommend to everyone. If you are interested, call 602765825 , register only on Mondays from 10 . 00 to 11 . 00 . It's hard to get through, but you can: )"
2147,"This does not fundamentally change the fact that, according to L2, hotel brands based in North America attach much more importance to the development of various forms of presence in the digital world than their counterparts from other continents. The worst digital IQs, with no more than 20 points, were recorded in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East and Africa regions. In this year's index as much as 81%. The hotel brands have websites optimised for mobile devices."
2148,"The hotel is long overdue. The room is clean and spacious, with two large beds. Unfortunately, it is inconvenient. Nice big balcony. Daily cleaning . Air conditioning worked perfectly. Bathroom would have needed a refreshment. The truth is that there are really thin walls and you can hear the neighbors and people in the hall. Restaurant - in my opinion, everyone will find something that they like. a kitchen typical for hotels with food. Surely the advantage of the hotel are 3 jacuzzis on the roof, beautiful views of the city, mountains and sea. Distance to the sea within a short walk. Nice surroundings, Barcelona can be reached by train in 1 . 20 hours."

By the end of 2015 Orbis SA wants to have at least 10 hotels of the brand in Poland. The hotel is located in Reda near Gdynia and will operate under a franchise agreement. Ibis Styles, previously known as all seasons, is a chain of budget hotels launched by the Accor Group in 2007. The facilities of this brand combine an individual hotel concept of independent hotels with chain service standards. ibis Styles hotels are medium sized (up to 150 rooms in Europe and 200 in Asia). In Europe, the brand is growing mainly through franchise agreements (95% of the hotels), while in Asia and the Pacific, it is growing under management contracts."
2150,"As prof . Gawrońska - Kozak , it is unusual that in people at a very early stage of life (in fetal life) skin wounds heal without any scars. Surgery performed on children in the womb until the end of the second trimester of pregnancy leaves no traces, while when the child is operated on in the following weeks of pregnancy the scars are already visible. Interestingly, redirecting scar-free healing to scar tissue coincides with activation of Foxn1 - ""scar gene"" activity. Currently conducted research in the Regenerative Biology Laboratory in the future may enable treatment of healing wounds, e.g. in diabetics. They may also help in the treatment of patients whose wounds leave extensive, debilitating or disfiguring scars."
2151,"Dr. Ufnalewski is leading my second threatened pregnancy. I am now in the second half. I know perfectly well that just like I can count on Dr. Ufnalewski, I think I can count on nobody. Thanks to him, I think I'm still mentally stable somehow. There is still some reason to call the doctor, I think it's probably too frequent but it's important that I can always count on him to answer the phone and explain to me all my doubts and dispel my concerns. Well, I hope there aren't so many troublesome patients like me. I think she is the best doctor in the world."
2152,"I had a chance to use this hotel last week. Clean, tidy, tasty and in a very good location. One problem, it's the unbearable smell of cigarette smoke right at the entrance. Smoking in the lobby should be completely forbidden, because the unpleasant smell is disgusting to greet! ."
2153,"A terrible hotel. Dirty, all old. From the bathroom the stench was unbearable, which was coming out on the whole room. We moved to another room where it smelled a little less. The staff didn't want to give us a room in the new part because they said ""there are no places"". After searching the cabinets it turned out that there was a dead bug in one. Breakfast was very poor, but we could eat something. By the pool there was never any place to sit - from morning to evening there were unfolded towels. Generally, the hotel was very weak, I certainly don't recommend it and she didn't want me to go back there. The only thing you can write about is a pretty good location - close to restaurants, shops, promenade leading to the sea."
2154,"in a word, disaster ! In the pictures on the Internet, the hotel looks clean and neat, but upon arrival we were disappointed! The mess and ford left after the previous residents (papers under the bed, an apple in a state of decomposition after the bed, sand, dirty tub, fungal plastic foot mat). On the last day of the stay the cleaning lady exchanged my bed linen for bed linen from another room terribly sweaty stinking all over the room, when she went to report it to me she suddenly pretended that she does not know what is going on and does not understand English, and so far she understood . . . . for 2 weeks of stay the floor was washed once, towels changed every 2 - 3 days. service very unpleasant, at the request of help every time they did it with a cane, ladies in the dining room very nervous, the dining room manager insolent, silent Greek complacent! eating for 2 weeks over and over again the same thing, processed only in different variants, you could eat but the taste was not too much. all - inclusive is a scam in the rooms lacking water to drink - you have to buy yourself, for the beach towels you have to placic, etc.. . Memories after the vacation is a scam, mess mess mess with bad food and unpleasant service! who appreciates at least a bit of cleanliness is sincerely not recommended!"
2156,"The second of Krakow's facilities - Quality Hotel System Krakow North - has chosen independence and currently provides services under the name WM Hotel System. All listed facilities have a three-star standard. The five-star Clairon Hotel Grand Baltic Resort & Spa, on the other hand, has completely abandoned the reference in its name to both the Choice (Quality) and Hotel System and is now called Havet Hotel Dźwirzyno. Therefore, the beginning of Choice Hotels International's operations in Poland did not turn out to be very prosperous, and the development of events confirmed the restrained approach of large hotel chains to binding their brands to condo facilities. The negotiations not with one, but with a few or several dozen owners, and thus several dozen different views on the hotel business, can be much more difficult or even impossible to be successfully concluded. Is the end of cooperation with the former Hotel System facilities also the end of Choice's presence on the Polish market?"
2157,"She came to the hotel for the first time and she did not disappoint me. Contrary to previous reviews, the staff is very friendly and willing to help. Meals rich and very varied . There was only lack of choice of drinks for meals. Organization of time for children is great . Thanks to the support of the staff and numerous attractions for children, she had time for herself. A little bit weak SPA offer for those times and for that name. Paid bathrobes - it's weird for this hotel standard. The entire facility is quiet, clean and very pleasant. I was delighted with the restaurant with its glass wall. A huge advantage is the location of the hotel at the very beach and not far from the center of Darlowko. A wonderful rest. I recommend it!"
2158,"Mrs. Karolina is a professional speech therapist, always prepared for classes, using a variety of teaching materials. Three years ago Mrs. Caroline helped my older daughter, who did not pronounce the l, r, sz and a little bit of a bite. Thanks to a great approach to children, a lesson in the form of play (e.g. board games are used), a flexible approach to children and systematic approach, my daughter quickly started to speak correctly. This year she invited Karolina to teach my younger daughter, who had problems with pronunciation. The voice is already "" called "" but surely by the end of the preschool year your daughter will be practicing with Mrs. Karolina because she loves these activities and Mrs. Karolina. I sincerely recommend! Kinga Flieger"
2159,"The prototype of the device, which was created thanks to the cooperation of scientists from the Silesian University of Technology, Częstochowa University of Technology, doctors from the Burn Treatment Centre in Siemianowice Śląskie and engineers from the Institute of Medical Equipment in Zabrze, moves over the patient's body, ""scanning"" the wound surface. After the measurement, the thermograms are ""spread out"" on the plane and compared with each other. Therefore, apart from the diagnosis of the burn itself, banded thermovision allows for comparison of the way and rate of wound healing, allowing for adjustment of therapy and effective treatment. ""The path of such an invention to universal use is very long,"" says Professor Majchrzak. ""First there is the concept and the virtual model, which we created in cooperation with doctors from Siemianowice, through the prototype made by the Zabrze IAM, and then the tests, which are still few and far between. Such equipment is first tested on dummies, its safety is checked, the way the test is carried out is tested (e.g. distance from the wound, allowing to optimize the measurement), then the test is carried out on the healthy and sick"" - describes the researcher."
2160,"Hotel cool but . . Poor location 500 m to the sea, rotating cafe on the 5th floor, what with the view of the blocks of flats you cannot see the sea. They bought us a hotel asking for a room in a quiet part because of the stay with a small child (out of the window deep well construction works) lack of knowledge by the reception staff. She asked for a change she asked for a change of room, they received us but also without thinking about it was supposed to be a double bed because of the child slept with us of course there was no such thing. In addition, at the entrance of the inf.z does not work a card when you leave the parking lot, then problems with laundry, the swimming pool has bathrobes, of course we did not receive a bathrobe for the child, reported to the reception and without a response. WiFi is some kind of failure but to take advantage of this of course with problems, a hopeless solution everyone in the hotel uses one password. Parking is small and additionally paid. There are no accessories for guests on the beach (screens, deck chairs, parasols). The driveway / pushchair exit is not adapted. Tasty food, as for a hotel 5 * there should be more choice of dishes for dinner, children's dishes - hard meat. Coffee queues, which only for breakfast can be made in the price of stay."
2161,"Rooms certainly not as in the pictures, the pool does not work. Eating good. Today was at the reception desk an elderly gentleman who was very nice, previously the young man was not so nice. Internet in countries like Serbia, Macedonia at gas stations is free, and here they want €1 and internet only at reception. Middle Ages"
2162,"I support my predecessor - my child also turned out to be ""deaf"" (in fact he has very good hearing). The doctor wanted to write out a referral to the hospital for a palatal tonsil excision. She admitted that she did not see any indications for such a procedure, but the referral would give ""no indications"". The examination of the third almond is not performed at all (because it is better to make a diagnosis ""on the eye""). She looks into both ears with the same disposable tool - contrary to hygiene and safety rules. I do not recommend! I am supplementing the opinion - however, my son had 3 enlarged almonds and not the palate tonsils, he is already after the adenotomy (from another doctor's referral). Instead of treating chronic sinusitis with an antibiotic and referral for adenotomy, the doctor prescribed homeopathic drops (these are not legal medicines) and still wanted to rinse the sinuses for a 3-year-old, but not with an antibiotic but with an ordinary saline solution. Such treatment did not bring any good results, it only exacerbated the condition and the child underwent solid antibiotic therapy before the almond excision. For 3 months there has been no rhinitis, no snoring, but it is thanks to other doctors."
2163,"The choice of the right scent is still an individual matter, as it depends on the person's taste. This Chanel is more citrus than its usual counterpart . I like the scent terribly, it fits perfectly on the skin. After sniffing, the cloud of scent stays with me for up to 2 hours, then it is felt only at the close-up. On the second day you can still smell it a little, especially on your clothes. The only thing that saddens me is the fact that the price is too high - abroad the price remains for over 100 PLN. Perfect for warm days. Women also like it."
2164,"I've known this doctor for years. He used to be a very good doctor. Unfortunately, with time, the routine crept in. And I think he's having trouble with his own health. As for listening to the patient, he rather has a problem with that. Otherwise, he wouldn't have stuffed me with more unnecessary medications, but he would have ordered an x-ray, as she asked me to. And yes, he pissed me off, decided to act on his own and it turned out that I was right. Another doctor immediately referred me to the hospital for surgery."
2165,"First of all, this is a beautiful big hotel, both inside and outside. The subway is just around the corner, taxis are just around the corner, and the city's attractions are just a few minutes' walk away. The lobby is pleasantly cool, especially in the summer when I was there, but the air conditioning in the rooms is a bit worn out. My room was on the 8th floor, it was open to the card, which was also used to light up the lights and switch on the air conditioning. Great view from the balcony. On Omonia Square, where the hotel is located, there are several shops for tourists. The balcony door is closed and nothing can be heard, which surprised me. There is satellite TV (movies in English at night), safe in the room, mini-bar, room service, etc. The perfect bathroom, very pleasant, although I don't understand why anyone should have a phone in it when one is already in bed. All in all, this is the perfect hotel for a stay in Athens, at a price of a little over 100 euros per night, but worth it. I wouldn't wonder if I'd be thinking about another hotel in Athens than this one."
2166,"""The IHG was the first international hotel group to appear in China almost 30 years ago, which gives us a deep understanding of the market and consumers. Over the past years we have been successful with five of our brands already present in this market and we will use this experience to develop the Hualuxe brand. ...says Keith Barr, director of IHG China. The largest hotel group in the world, IHG, is also the largest international hotel operator in China. IHG has over 160 hotels in 60 cities in China and wants to be present in more than 100 cities in 15-20 years. The Hualuxe brand was created in response to three growth factors: - The demand for a prestigious international hotel brand that would reflect the local Chinese tradition and aspirations, - An increase in the number of domestic travels in China to 3.3 billion in 2015 and an increase in the hotel market of 5-8% per year by 2030 (according to forecasts of the China National Tourism Administration), - An increase in international travel by Chinese residents from the current 10 million to over 100 million over the next 10 to 15 years. Photo: Hualuxe hotel visualizations: facade, tea room, lobby and room. About preparations for the launch of the new IHG brand: InterContinental Hotel Group presented a project of an upscale (5 star) hotel designed specifically for the Chinese tourist."
2167,"I got a doctor in the neurology department. She hasn't met a more impatient and cold doctor. She poured the diagnosis ""multiple sclerosis"" on my head like a bucket of cold water and then she turned on her heel with the rest of the rounds. I never want to meet her again on my way."
2168,"Hotel in the city centre close to the centre etc. In fact, apart from that and quite fast wifi is the only plus. The cheapest room, about 300 zloty a day. No parking (parking at the hotel additional 50 zl) no breakfast (basic buffet 50zl) service at the reception as well as poor lack of basic information, fear of answering questions and amateur. The room is clean, the bed is connected with two singles which makes it uncomfortable to sleep on a hard mattress, but I like to sleep on such a bed so you can treat it as a plus. Bathroom in a crying state lacking a shower curtain which causes the water to spill all over the room, the water in the washbasin will not flush out which causes a small pond in the washbasin. Garbage basket does not open, dirty walls in the bathroom no glass etc. The 4-star hotel is served by the hotel in the top 2. I wish the hotel a little more sense and instead of punishing customers for everything even for ""free"" coffee at the reception desk he should give something from himself. Good luck."
2169,"It is rather a conference facility, or as a wedding house, although in the summer season it may also be of interest to the natural and tourist attractions. As for the standard of the object, the question arises as to who has expectationsThe building is from the ""communist"" times, although renovated and constantly improved. Very nice staff. The rooms are quite small and already to some extent ""worn out"" but in general you can write that not too high price does not justify too high expectations, I just have what I pay for."
2170,"Sabre Corporation has launched a generator of ready-made websites for hotels .

The SynXis InstaSite product is a self-service, ready-made solution that allows you to run a personalized, fully operational website within three days. It will be responsive with a dedicated sales solution. Initially the solution will be available in five languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and German.

2171,"Very poor hotel, low level service, tragic restaurant. At halfway through the room the waiting time for lunch is 1.5 hours, the prices are very high and the food is almost inedible. . . Stinky soup, not fresh, roast beef (should not even be called that) hard. . . Fish too fried, as if completely thrown into a fritz, dry inside! The waitress doesn't know what's there, what isn't there (""the cook didn't tell me""). Standard below the level, it's been a long time since I've seen something like that. . ."
2172,Hello everybody I don't know what's going on here I don't know what you're writing about that good doctor I used to see and this lady and I'm not very happy I'm not very happy yes she's nice but she didn't give me any more information no more tests nothing I just got sold out hm maybe my disease is too much of a challenge for the lady doctor and maybe I don't want to hurt her I'll look for another cure
2173,"We spent one night in a hotel during our journey through the Balkans. The service was nice and helpful - preparing breakfast for an earlier hour was not a problem and served to us ""a set of stickers"" was delicious! The rooms were brand new and tastefully decorated. Price for this standard is very attractive. I recommend : )"
2174,"Cold water (when you turn off the shower for half an hour, it flies warm), a bathroom for 2 rooms (in the price list they call it ""studio""), a cold room (I got a faggot to warm up), a bad breakfast (and the whole thing is filled with instant coffee from the vending machine as at the station), the wooool internet (as long as it is, because it rips every moment). Generally I am used to the fact that for this price you get more (or a half of the price, or 1 / 3). Even taxi drivers have a problem with the location of this hotel (for 5 trips - I had to explain twice where it is). . . ."
2175,"The wellness at a high level, I especially recommend massages that the ladies of Thailand do;) good food, the rooms I recommend with a terrace, a nice solution in these rooms is a lockable remote control canopy. From the hotel close to any place, prices at standard level. Hotel worth a visit"
2176,Nice from the outside. The hotel lobby too . Rooms and cleanliness in the rooms is a separate fairy tale . We lived for 7 days and slept in the same bedding; no change and the hotel is 3-star. Cleanliness in the bathroom is a massacre. Fetor and ever-dripping water in the bathroom. The beach too close to the port feel all the time oil and mazout lies on the stones. Monotonous food . After three days we had enough of it. Do not recommend .
2177,"We just got back from the Diva Spa Hotel. The hotel is a 4-star average, unforgettable. The big disadvantage of this hotel is unfortunately the boarding - for the whole week there was only once a fish for lunch in addition simply fried in a coat. A very small choice for dinner, food without taste, often stew (because the easiest and cheapest), noticeable savings on guests - only small plates for breakfast (the first time we met with something like this), as the waffle chef gave out half a waffle per person claiming that ""this is a portion"" and you can not get the whole waffle. Comfort room: medium, no crazy, squeaky doors to the balcony, but quite large and spacious, bathroom o.k.stuffy and small lifts.pool o.k.though depressing view of the abandoned hotel from windows."
2178,""" Kap7 - Methyloguanosine is located at one of the ends of the mRNA ( the so-called . end 5 ' ) - explains prof . Darżynkiewicz . - In the cytoplasm, the structure of capu is recognized by the eIF4E factor initiating the process of protein biosynthesis, i.e. translation . This stage determines the speed of the whole complex sequence of events that end up producing a protein in a cell. The presence of capu also protects mRNAs from premature degradation by intersecting enzymes - nucleases. Unfortunately, the cells have a natural mechanism of capu removal by the so-called capu degradation enzymes (decapping enzymes, e.g. Dcp1 / Dcp2). A few years ago we discovered that the use of modified capu analogs can make the end of 5 ' mRNAs more resistant to degradation and increase their efficiency ' . ""In a paper recently published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research, we presented a new class of modified caps - an improved version of those currently found in clinical trials, informs Prof . Jemielites . - The modification consists in changing the oxygen atom with a sulphur atom in several positions . The cap is then bound to a record high efficiency and has high resistance to degrading enzymes. The modification leads to the creation of much more therapeutic protein "" ."
2179,"The hotel deserves praise. The service is really very nice and friendly to guests - everyone is willing to give information, smile at guests - which is hardly ever the case nowadays. Besides, the prices are very affordable - even with a limited budget you can always agree on the price. The meals are very tasty and generous. The room where she lived in was clean - the heat of course, with heat - just put the card into the device (maybe not everyone knows how to use the device) and it flies warmly from the air. A really worthy object!"
2180,"A great doctor. I recommend it to everyone. If it weren't for the Doctor, my son would probably have been dead a long time ago. I wish everyone looking for medical help to find a doctor as dedicated to the patient as Ewa Wasinska. I recommend from the bottom of my heart and thank you for everything you have done for us."
2181,"The overall impression of our stay is very good. Hotel located in a very picturesque place . The vast and well-developed area around - you can envy . The entrance gate is like a Hollywood residence (Carrington probably did not have one) and the stone wall is impressive. The hotel is modern and stylish. The room is clean, spacious and nicely decorated with an exit to the terrace. Restaurant and meals without any problems. Swimming pool with many attractions. The Spa team deserves the highest praise. Excellent professionals, especially your beautician and your massage therapist. And as always, mini-sizes are there. There are no bathrobes in the right size for us (not everyone has a size s : ( ) . Our suggestion for the hotel: open the swimming pool earlier, because it is an hour. 10 o'clock is after breakfast and it would be nice to jump in the morning to warm water."
2182,"Ablation is a non-pharmacological treatment for cardiac arrhythmias. It consists in inserting special electrodes into the heart through an insertion into the femoral vein, connected to a computer. This allows the doctor to properly assess the electrical activity of the heart and precisely locate the place causing the arrhythmia. Then the malfunctioning tissue of the myocardium is heated up by alternating current of radio frequency. The desired effect of this procedure is a small scar which loses its conductive properties and stops being a source of heart rhythm disturbances. Training ablation procedures in Zabrze were performed with the use of electroanatomical system Ensite Precision - a new generation tool which allows to perform complicated procedures of cardiac arrhythmias ablation in a much shorter time and increase their safety. The system allows to create a three-dimensional geometric map of the heart with the simultaneous creation of potential and time maps of studied heart structures. Thanks to this system, it is not necessary to use X-rays during the procedure, which in high doses are dangerous for patients and medical personnel."
2183,"A magnificent hotel in the middle of a national park with a wonderful view of the mountains. Silence, fresh air, fantastic spa is all you need to relax. Breakfasts are delicious with the best croissants she has eaten m - warm freshly pulled out of the oven. And although in winter the winding road can be a bit scary, it's really well maintained and snow-covered so getting there is no problem. Close to many walking trails and an agritourism farm with horses and donkey. I recommend to everyone who wants to relax and ""recharge the batteries"" ."
2184,"The second important objective of the project is to develop new methods of synthesis of antidepressants. These methods can be used both to obtain existing drugs on the market and to obtain new substances. ""We were looking for solutions that would be more efficient, more economical and more ecological, in line with green chemistry principles. I can confirm that we already have two new methods developed at this stage of research. We are preparing to patent them"" - said Dr. Jaśkowska . As she explained, the measures proposed by her team will shorten the drug production process by several time-consuming and costly phases. ""According to our methods, the time when the desired chemical reaction takes place is a few minutes, and in some cases just a few dozen seconds. Our ideas have also reduced the contribution of toxic solvents to the formation of new compounds,"" said the scientist."
2185,"Using the opportunities offered by the monthly transfer of several thousand zlotys to the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), I had previously been consulted on the so-called Health Fund in another laryngologist and despite the diagnosis made by other doctors, decided to invest an additional 150 zlotys and consult with the Chief Medical Officer himself. Piotr Łach . The guest is great, he really knows what he is talking about, he listened to me very carefully, he also looked at my pictures from the sinus CT scan. In a few sentences he convinced me about the diagnosis. Thanks a lot to him for that. Unfortunately, it is paranoid that a nasal septum surgery performed on the Health Fund is a waiting time of over two years. Luckily, the doctor also proposed another solution in the same Rydygier's hospital, which can be surgically performed right away if you have only about 6000 PLN. And this is the dark side of the moon. . ."
2186,"I also do not recommend this doctor, maybe he has a different approach in the hospital or in a private clinic, but I went to the NFZ, changed my doctor after two visits to this gentleman, because when I was 12 weeks pregnant, I was not yet given a card, because as it was stated on the day when I was there (1, 5 hours before the doctor), the lady in the registration has a terrible boiler and it will not make any difference to me whether it will be this week or in 2 weeks (on the next visit). But that is not the worst, in general there is a huge chaos in the clinic, everyone enters as they wish, as if a queue is established, and in a moment a mill is being made, because the ladies from the registration do not know what and how, and the LEADER has, in my opinion, the subjective approach to the patient, after the visit I felt as if I was not at the doctor's, because any information about my health was difficult to obtain, and even more so about the health of the child, because the ultrasound was not done even once. MISTAKE - DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED! ! ! ! !"
2187,"He has a friendly attitude towards the student, the classes are well run. Evaluation is for attendance. I recommend ."
2188,"We spent 4 days in Hotel Mikolajki around New Year's Eve (stay with New Year's Eve party). New Year's Eve party was very well organized, the artistic part was slightly dragged out, because the dancing started only after 22nd, but the orchestra playing live made up for it. At the same time, there was a party for children with animators, a great idea, we were very pleased, and the daughter was even delighted. Unfortunately, the stay itself was not a fantastic one. The room with a kitchenette is nice, spacious but definitely not cleaned. Finding a condom under the bed after previous guests slightly shocked us! During our stay, a crystal pendant disappeared from our room. I have never met with something like that in a hotel of this class: - (Breakfast and dinner varied, but certainly not delicious. Waiting staff, reception staff and spa staff are very nice. Nevertheless, we are not likely to come back."
2189,"She was with Dr. Legan on a private visit to Swiss Meda in Jaskan Valley. I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND. She did the examination very gently and at my request to examine me a little more gently if possible because it hurts, she replied that she has to examine it and that's it. I find it totally inappropriate that the doctor after the examination for the information that in some time I am going to get pregnant said to me that at my age (32 years old) it may be too late and that it is all because of the fact that ""the girls have now postponed the moment of having children"". What right does a person who doesn't know me, doesn't know what my personal or material situation is, think he can speak in this way about my life? ! ? ! The doctor can gently encourage the patient to decide to get pregnant, if she is planning it, kindly saying that at a later age it may be more difficult to get pregnant. But he should do it out of concern for the good of the patient and in the right way. I don't recommend it to anyone and I'm sure I won't go back to that doctor."
2190,"In May she spent a fantastic week at the Gallini Sea view hotel. The weather was good, and the hotel and staff did a great job. : ) The rooms were clean and the linen was changed very often. There was plenty of delicious food to choose from and desserts were fantastic. The hotel was located on a hill where the views are great. The sea is 5 minutes away and there we can enjoy a very long beach which delights with its fine, hot sand. It is ideal for long romantic walks for two. A free a'la carte dinner was a great choice of Chinese and Italian restaurants. Very nice hotel staff, helped at any time. Evening animations were a nice rest for children and adults. In the bars of the hotel and on the beach you could always find fresh fruit, snacks, cold drinks and great drinks. The Gallini Hotel certainly delights and can be recommended to everyone. : )"
2191,"We had the opportunity to spend the night in this facility. As far as the rooms are concerned, the bed is spacious and unfortunately not very good. I have the biggest doubts about the cleanliness - under the bed probably nobody has cleaned for a long time. . . . Our room was located in a corner of the building, yet we could hear every step and conversation from the corridor and other rooms. The price of the room was dinner. We were tempted by it because we were very hungry after the trip. The meal did not delight. For this breakfast was tasty and quite rich. Generally for this price there is no need to complain. . ."
2192,"Location of the hotel, close to everything, great food, great swimming pool. A bit high prices, but if you choose this hotel then you must be aware of it. The only thing that could be better is the children's playrooms to make them bigger. Such a big hotel and there was no room for it. The important thing is that a lot of people come here with them. I got the impression that I'm not so organized about it. The most important thing is that a lot of people come here with them. Despite everything, I recommend this hotel to everyone, I will come back here more than once with my family.) . Greetings"
2193,"The hotel is perfectly located (entrance to the beach about 3 minutes), the surroundings and all the rooms are clean and neat. The food is very good and varied (waffles after breakfast revelation). During the winter holidays, the hotel is full of children for whom there were special meals, animations, a playroom, a room with X-box, table football. A great swimming pool with hot water and saunas, Jacuzzi. In the saunas, instead of noise from the pool, relaxing music would be useful. I recommend, winter trip very successful."
2194,"Unfortunately 4 * only by name and with the fact that there is a pool. Breakfast is average, monotonous and modest. Little choice . Dinners in the form of thematic buffet also did not knock down - 2 soups, lettuce, 2 main dishes, dessert - e.g. French cuisine - unfortunately, only onion soup and the rest as if Polish: (dessert in style - bought ready-made cupcake bottoms filled with whipped cream and sprinkled with shavings - could do even children as part of the fun, and not the hotel kitchen 4 * . The ladies' lounge at the restaurant with a huge mushroom culture all over the ceiling. A microclimate like in the tropics. The rooms are quite big, but they are already dilapidated. If you're with children, it's better to pay a higher standard in the main building because there's a restaurant, pool and spa."
2195,"A friend and I set off to rest outside the city on a Sunday afternoon. In Koninki, among the beautiful landscapes, there is a restaurant in the hotel Górski Raj. The place is not bad as a decoration pity that the restaurant staff leaves to wish for. 4 waiters - we wait 15 minutes and nobody even comes up with a card. After calling, you come with a pen, surprised to see that maybe the card from the menu first would be happy to see. We order trout in garlic butter and grilled vegetables. After 25 minutes, the trout enters. Look at nothing. We start to taste: - unfortunately, garlic butter does not feel - the fries are completely tasteless and not fried freshly - grilled vegetables are a thinly sliced mix which is flooded with oil! ! ! ! After our intervention, vegetables were not included in our bill. The service is lamentable ! Slow and absent . Not recommended ! We go to try the SPA "" Paradise Moment "" . Ola and Renia"
2196,"Mr. docent is a great man, lectures are conducted in a very accessible and interesting way, you can learn a lot. The exam is actually quite difficult, but on improvement are usually the same tasks (possibly changed data or mixed groups) as on the basic date. It is also worthwhile to review the exams from previous years, the questions are always repeated. Generally - I recommend"
2197,"Peace as in Poland for the communist era. A big feat to set the temperature of the water in the bathroom. Destroyed door and TV set probably over 20 years old . The bed is usually a couch and the cover is a blanket with sheets. 3 stars is probably the hotel fell out of the sky. Wifi paid 2 euros for 1 hour. In the stool in the corners of the cottage and the walls are completely dirty. The food was tolerable, but there was no Swedish table for breakfast, but there was no problem with the extras. The juice, on the other hand, was served again with diluted water. To the shops and markets close by and to places to get something if someone feels like it."
2198,"According to prof . Kwiatkowski - one of the contractors of the first chain kidney transplantation in Poland, changes are needed in the field of kidney acquisition and distribution, eligibility rules for kidney transplantation and financing of transplantation. The qualification of patients for kidney transplantation, which is carried out in dialysis stations, where patients with chronic kidney failure undergo blood purification procedures from toxic toxins. ""In these centres about 22 thousand patients are treated, but only 5% of them are reported for transplantation. Therefore, the vast majority of patients, i.e. as many as 95%, are not included on the national waiting list for a kidney transplantation"" - emphasised prof . Kwiatkowski ."
2199,"I definitely do not recommend this Hotel. In the pictures maybe the rooms look nice, in real life it is much worse. Restaurant, non-special menu. But the worst part is the lack of competence of the staff. The marketing lady is able to notify the lack of places for guests 2 days before arrival while the reservation was made a few months earlier. In return, they offer another hotel allegedly of the same standard. In fact it is a hotel of a much lower standard and again we are cheated. Repeated emails, requests for an invoice do not give a result, they just don't care and they don't answer emails. Tragedy, get as far away from this hotel as possible! ! !"
2200,"She spent a week there with her husband and her 9-month-old child. Service : Very nice service . Always smiling and willing to talk. Very helpful staff. Room : Big room . We had a separate bedroom, bathroom, balcony and kitchenette. The annexe was well stocked with crockery and cutlery, but the lack of washing up liquid or electric kettle was a small problem. View of the nearby street and the sea. The windows perfectly mute the music from nearby restaurants, so you can sleep peacefully. Eating: Breakfast and lunch at the hotel are unfortunately monotonous. Every day practically the same. While for breakfast there is a big choice and she wouldn't come up with what they could serve more, for lunch every day the same thing (about 6 dishes) is quickly becoming a mess. However, from the morning to 6 pm various snacks are still available so you can not get hungry. However, dinner at the Hotel Insotel (about 5 minutes on foot) was a good spring break. Very large selection of dishes and every day some Spanish delicacies. SUPER . Hotel : Hotel exactly as you can expect from 3 * . Nothing surprised me. The pool is small but ideal for sitting in the water. Three depths, so every child will find a place for himself. The big convenience is the playground near the pool and the restaurant, which is fenced with a fence and lined with artificial grass. We spent a lot of time there because we could let our little girl go free to crawl. There is also a ping-pong table by the pool. We didn't use the evening animation at the Insotel, so I can't judge that. LocationThere are three beaches in the area from about . 5 - 15 min walk. A shallow descent so ideal for families with children. Sun loungers and umbrellas are paid for (set of 2 lounger umbrellas about 14e), but you can freely unfold on the sand, there is plenty of space. Not far from the village of Porto Cristo, about 45 minutes on foot, by car about. 10 - 15 min . However, I recommend a walk, because the road is very simple and it is hard to find parking places in the city. There is a bus stop next to the hotel. There is a Spar shop next to the hotel, but shopping in Porto cristo in the Hiper Centro Navegante supermarket is more like it is. The prices are much lower. The town is generally a quiet place and it is more of a place to go to further corners of Mallorca than a place to party."
2201,"Very difficult to contact, conceited, reluctant, reluctant, behaving in a resultant way, and in fact, only those patients whom he treats privately, I do not trust, did not help me, did not even try, he is only the headmaster and behaves as if he were the ruler, the team which he directs clearly does not like him, he is not nice and not fully competent. There are many better surgeons working in his department, Patient"
2202,"She saw that movie in the cinema. Unfortunately, it disappointed me a little bit (but my husband liked it a lot). The story told in the film is quite interesting, well recreated Legnica of the war time. However, the characters seem to me too vague, colorless and devoid of character. I also didn't like the fact that mother and daughter are played by the same actress - it creates unnecessary confusion. The film is worth watching to see that Polish cinema sometimes tries something more ambitious than just another romantic comedy, but it did not arouse special emotions in me."
2203,"The description of the hotel on the office website is untrue ! I do not know where 4 * when in a family room for four people for the whole week not once washed the floor in the bathroom, washbasin or bathtub, not vacuumed stained carpet (not to mention cobwebs at the windows) We were exchanged towels only once and on request, when she entered the room during the so-called cleaning. In the so called . 4 * hotel there is a stone and stench lying in the hotel - the norm. Attractions for children BRAK - the only attraction - watching cartoons in the hall is also subject to restrictions, you can not ask the remote control, because the throat. The boss takes away the boss staff, or hotel guests. There is no mini-discussion or animation outside the game of darts (of course you have to ask the animator in person), gymnastics in water - so swimming on your own (ha, ha . . . . ), and sorry I forgot to add that three times we enforced the game of water polo, because we referred to the information on the front door of the hotel about so-called . animations (wdłg . which 5 times during the day something should happen) . And finally a hit - attractive animations for adults, which desperate and disgusted ones organized themselves (once, when for a moment the equipment was brought instead of computer speakers - thanks to Karina, who played the role of an animator (maybe she will get free next week's stay? ? ? ? as part of the payment for the work done) Believe me, I'm not coloring, I'm just angry, because one star higher standard hotel, everything looked different - that's where we used to use evening animations for children and adults. I think. description in our hotel 3 times a week during the day entertainment program - fact - only once a half an hour performance of a Bulgarian folklore band. As far as food is concerned, I will not be picky, it was ok, but the question is whether for 4 * two juices - water diluted concentrates are normal? Breakfast for sleepers is also a fiction. And finally, the cloudy faces of the hotel staff, certainly do not make friends. To the nearest beach ok . 500m just to warn you there, the standard also resembles the room described above, but in order not to end so pessimistic, the only thing that did not disappoint is the weather and good company."
2204,"Yesterday, I got 'em from vacation at the Iris Hotel. I think it's a tragedy. The boss is screaming at the kids at 3 years old that broke a glass. The food is very little and tasteless and between lunch and dinner there is nothing to eat. In the evenings, nothing happens on the hotel premises, just like during the day. It's already at 10:00 p.m. 50 nothing can be ordered from the bar (unless for a fee) . I do not recommend this hotel."
2205,"A doctor who chooses who he wants to treat himself. I went to him to diagnose the pregnancy. Since I am after a serious abdominal surgery and often have post-operative complications my pregnancy may be pathological and unfortunately she had the impression that the doctor is doing everything he can to discourage me. He was almost not interviewed at all - I was the one who was telling him all the time what I was sick with and what I was taking, no interest, he didn't want to do an ultrasound but after thinking, he said that maybe he will look at what is to exclude ectopic pregnancies. He said that I should go to a pregnancy clinic, and when she asked me if he was still taking it in Bielany, he definitely denied that he works there. . . When asked if he would give me L4, he laughed at me because he said that there was nothing wrong with me, but I really felt bad and in addition I am after a serious abdominal surgery. The doctor has a supposed specialization of an endocrinologist, and he didn't even ask about TSH, even though he has been suffering from hypothyroidism since childhood. He wasn't even interested in increasing the dose of hormones, for which, as she went to an endocrinologist later on, the doctor punched my eyes out and immediately increased my dose of thyroid drugs. I personally advise against this doctor."
2206,"For the location of the SUPER assessment - lake, forest, developed waterfront. There is a place to swim, there is something to visit. Peace and quiet. But all the time some refurbishment in the season, if not the waterfront are the rooms, the facilities and spa - well, that's what happens, but why in the season? The rooms are a bit neglected, not dusty, the restaurant (with maybe a bar?) almost nonexistent. This has been forgotten. A barbecue and beer alone is not enough. It is good that there is a roof over the fireplace, only this half kitchen for such an object is like a flower to a sheepskin. However, despite this I recommend the place as an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of crazy Augustów."
2207,"Many of these people can lead an intensive professional and sporting life under appropriate care. An example is the snowboarder Shaun White, who was born in 1986 with the tetralogy of Fallot, a bruising heart defect that accounts for 3 - 5% of all congenital heart defects, making it the most common bruising heart defect during the postpartum period. Shaun White underwent two open heart surgeries before the age of one. ""At school age, however, he was never exempt from WF classes,"" emphasized prof . Hoffman . He has been snowboarding since childhood. At the age of 9 he became interested in Anthony Frank Hawk, the first competitor to make a 900-degree turn in the air and landed correctly."
2208,"I have been staying regularly at the Ibis Stare Miasto Hotel for two years - this is determined by the distance to the HO of the company where I work. Unfortunately, but apart from the distance, I can't write anything good about Ibis, and certainly not about breakfasts - the worst scrambled eggs I've ever had! ! ! plastic ham, cheese and pancakes. . . The hotel itself, like the Ibis - ""macdonald"" - is quite clean, although the rooms sometimes smell of ""rotten egg"", I have the impression that it is the effect of used cleaning detergents. A small splash of the hotel is the hamburgers in the bar but you don't go to the hotel for hamburgers. . . And also those ubiquitous apples. . ."
2209,"A huge hotel without a soul, it's seemingly normal in such a large facility. Okay. Nice area around the hotel, nice swimming pools for children and so much for the rest. We're not talking about luxury, but some standard that you can't see here. Shocking is the lack of dressing gowns you have to leave your room and every time you dress in the changing rooms! Breakfast and dinner in the big canteen . Obsolete hotel decoration with all the patterns of the world . The worst staff at the reception desk nobody smiles! The maids pass you as if you were a ghost - it was the first time we met with such behavior! Nice lady blonde at breakfast who was the only one smiling - and at the pool also blonde with short hair - we greet ladies. Summary - it's not worth the money, calculated probably in terms of stars, which the hotel does not have. The same money was spent in the Grand Lubicz Hotel in Ustka and it has 4 stars and is a luxury hotel."
2210,"Whenever I'm at the doctor's, I exchange antibiotics to which I'm allergic. The doctor seemed quite amused by my allergy to two drugs and then wrote me an antibiotic to which I am allergic under another name. She found out about it during a visit to another doctor, I have been treating sinusitis for the third month, plus - I'm taking the tablets for detoxification. For me it's just incompetence."
2211,"In the hotel we were in September 2015, the center does not quite seem to us 5-star everything revolves around the tourists from the average age of 70 years old france to the town of Kavos we went for walks of shit and dirt terrible I do not know if the union has reached Greece on Corfu for sure not ! ! ! ! ! the madness of drunken underage Englishmen who go crazy on the roadside, there is actually nowhere to go for a walk, you have to sit in the middle, I don't recommend it."
2212,"Beautifully renovated castle, a very interesting combination of modernity and classic elements. The rooms (not in the main castle, but in the old farm buildings) are spacious, very clean and comfortable. However, the concept to combine 3 separate rooms in the common area (not the living room, not the vestibule) quite original. The food is very good. A big disadvantage is the need to carry luggage up the stairs - 2 of the 3 connected in the complex are on the first floor, to which lead narrow stairs. All rooms from A to D are in this arrangement. For the elderly or those with health problems it is not very convenient."
2213,"""Unfortunately, we still do not use the potential of peripheral blood morphology to detect blood diseases, including leukaemia. In the past, 20% of cases of this disease in Poland were detected in the morphology of peripheral blood performed routinely as part of periodic occupational medicine examinations, now only 2%. However, statistics show that in other European countries up to 40% of all cases of leukaemia are detected in this study"" - pointed out prof . Wiesław W . Jędrzejczak . "" The role of occupational medicine in early diagnosis of diseases is invaluable . Often it is the only moment in a few years when we perform any examination . Occupational medicine, apart from the basic role, which is of course to determine the possibility of performing a given job, is also an incentive to monitor one's health, a chance to detect possible diseases more quickly. The morphology of peripheral blood is not a standard test performed as part of preventive examinations, however, many employers finance additional health service packages for their employees and it is worth remembering about this examination"" - emphasized the national consultant in the field of occupational medicine Paweł Wdówik . ( PAP )"
2214,"Avoid the wide arch. You just need to boast to your friends what a super laptop / tablet . And I stupidly let 'em catch 'em on that marketing chopper. I don't recommend it. It worked super for the first month . Then the system died and it started. The service is messing up, it's not worth anything. The older one cannot be installed, because the manufacturer did not provide such an option - absolute lack of drivers. We managed to install 8 wines, but half the things do not work. After returning to 10 all from the beginning . The only thing left is to install a fresh system and sell it through allegro . I already write an opinion with MSI ."
2215,"It is a beautiful castle where time passes in a ""historical"" climate. What impressed me most was how this castle was restored from the ruins. It is a great respect to the investor that he has restored this object to such a very exclusive state. The service at the hotel was very nice. Both at the reception and in the restaurant. The meals are delicious and very varied. The swimming pool is not too big, but to get wet and play with the kids just fine. Saunas two, but somehow so strangely alternately switched on ; - ) . I highly recommend"
2216,"I will also join in the positive comments about Dr. Muchacka . My husband and I have great confidence in her because she is a doctor by vocation ! ! ! ! She has an appropriate approach to the youngest patients, she can make a good diagnosis and does not go straight to the easy way by prescribing antibiotics for any reason. Each visit takes place in a pleasant atmosphere. It is true that rarely visits take place at a predetermined time, but this is due to the fact that the doctor approaches each patient individually - so I absolutely do not resent it, I just got used to it: ) . Another thing is the doctor's notorious answering the phone during the visit (as some people accuse). . . . . . . . .but I absolutely don't mind, because I also call often for advice. . . He can take his own private time to help. How many doctors do you know? Because apart from Dr. Muchacca, I don't know any."
2217,"However, the purchasing power in Poland is lower than in other Western European countries, which makes particularly attractive and profitable investments in budgetary and economic facilities. Middle-class hotels offer relatively high standards of accommodation and services at reasonable prices. Christie + What draws attention to last year's investments: the sale of the InterContinental hotel in Warsaw, the entry of Takami Holding to the European hotel to modernise and open the facility within the luxurious Raffles chain, the sale of Polonez hotels in Poznań and Mercure Kasprowy in Zakopane by Orbis SA. In connection with the intensive promotion of Euro 2012, it is expected that foreign investors, especially from the Middle East, Asia and South Africa, will become more interested in the Polish market. The challenge is to finance new hotel projects, especially in the case of Euro loans. The level of granted loans to the value of their collateral is between 60 - 65%. The banks prefer to finance facilities from the budget and economic segments."
2218,"The doctor was very specific, he explained all doubts perfectly. It is a pity, however, that he did not have spare paper for the printer (hence this assessment). Unfortunately, I am not in Wroclaw every day and that due to lack of my time I can not pick up the photos. It would be nice to send an e-mail or even SMS. The evaluation is still very positive."
2219,"The stethoscope is probably familiar to every patient from the sight - these neck hung headphones have long since become a symbol of the medical profession. Thanks to this simple device, the doctor can quickly and comfortably listen to the patient and initially diagnose e.g. structural defects of the heart, lungs, abdominal cavity or even thyroid and arterial diseases. A traditional stethoscope is not a very complicated device - thanks to the membrane and the funnel hidden behind it, sounds from the patient's body are transmitted to the doctor's ear. ""The flow of blood or air in our body is accompanied by noise, which is transmitted through tissues and can be picked up on the skin. These sounds may contain information about certain pathological conditions in the body"" - explains Łukasz Nowak, PhD from the Institute of Fundamental Technological Problems of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, which conducts research on a new generation of stethoscopes."
2220,"The hotel is located in a very good place. The lake is mega clean, the weather did not allow to swim: ) Cold. Also in the summer probably great. The shallow far descent into the lake so small children can splash even far from the shore. Hotel clean and new . Service very nice come very basic . If you get along on some promotion, you have to enforce it . The bosses forget what it set . Strange but true: in the hotel I can not take food to a room for example for my wife. I guess they think with a herd of hungry little dwarves waiting in the room to eat to the full. It was about 5 pieces of bananas: ) The lady with the so called gate at the entrance to the breakfast room drew my attention and wanted € € € €: ) Generally speaking, I still recommend this hotel - we'll see something further or we'll come back there."
2221,"There are 8 days left until the start of the Euro 2012 football tournament. Contrary to the announcements of the organizers, hoteliers can not count on a million foreign guests, but good and those over 400 thousand foreigners who should appear during the tournament. Many Polish fans will also travel to the cities hosting the tournament. Careful estimates place their number between half a million and more than one million, depending on the success of the Polish team in the tournament. A statistical guest from abroad will leave the equivalent of 800 euros in Poland and a Polish fan 4 times less. Although the majority of these amounts will be spent outside of the accommodation, both of them are worthy of welcome. If they are really satisfied, they will come back one day."
2222,"In the 2011 / 2012 season only 4.5% were vaccinated. Poles, at least for several years. We are in this respect one of the last places in Europe. In 2005, 8.6% of people were vaccinated, and in 2009. - Only 6.8% in 2009. In Spain, for example, 19% of adults were vaccinated in 2010 / 2011, in the USA - 41%. In Spain, for example, 19% of adults were vaccinated in 2010/11, 41% in the USA and 24% in South Korea. ""It is surprising that Poles do not want to be vaccinated against flu, and at the same time during the flu season we complain about queues to the family doctor. What is the logic in this? All because we have a disrespectful attitude towards vaccination against this infection"" - added Professor Brydak ."
2223,"First question : Where are the surgeries at Dr Jarlinski's? Now my observation. Let me put it this way: I wanted to reduce my breasts, and that I don't have typical giantomastria and size doesn't threaten my backbone, I felt treated a little. . ...not to say that it's not serious, because it's too big a word, just very ""light"". I had the impression that Dr. Dr. was even trying to discourage me a little, which I didn't like. For, for a change, if someone wants to put on silicones, they don't do it for health reasons, just because they need them, and I haven't heard of anyone being discouraged from increasing their breasts, and to reduce them is already a crime against humanity. Whatever. I'm not gonna dwell on it. Besides, what I've been saying is, I've noticed that he's certainly a good person, warm-hearted and... . . .he surely doesn't pull money from people at all costs, which I think is a big advantage these days. Greetings and I ask you to answer."
2224,"the hotel is very weak, the service is not very splashing, we were in June 2015 and I guess nothing has changed for the better since then, a lot of guests from Turkey who treat it well jumping around them and all ppd them doing the oiling the rest of the guests, drinks masking the food of the eyes but some portion of it, generally weak, the bar at the beach is not good, generally avoiding the wide hatch! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
2225,"The worst was the food! I paid for the buffet (to have an election) and it turned out to be too little and I can only get what was prepared (the leftovers from the previous day, anyway) and half of the food is almost not in English! ! ! It is hard to communicate. The rooms are in order but the mattresses are very uncomfortable Food is hopeless! I paid for the buffet but it turned out to be too not that much people and I have to eat what they have prepared Never again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '"
2226,"Mr. Matthew is a recommended specialist. Very good contact with the patient, high personal culture and really big knowledge allows for full satisfaction of the procedure. She reported me with a headache which lasted a week. Five doctors were not able to help me, diagnosing obviously neuroses or migraines. After just one visit, I felt incredible relief (the pain was caused by bad posture habits and a position forced by my profession). Exercises and visits to Mr. Matthew I have been doing so far and the pain is much less and can be tolerated without pills what is important . I sincerely recommend"
2227,"Oh, Dr. Dr. I have a very bad opinion. In May 2008 I was sent to a private office of Mrs. Dr. Lewandowicz on Rajdowa Street - she was looking for help - all my joints hurt, my hands and wrists were swollen and she couldn't move them, my neck was stiff and I barely got there. She paid m 100 PLN and received an answer: that I am at that age, that it hurts (she was m 56 years old). On the page of Mrs. Dr . She wrote that she should buy a ZINAXIN in a herbalist's and take it for 3 months, then 2 breaks and the same again. She also advised me to apply for a disability group if it hurts so much. So far I have this card written in my hand by Dr . Lewandowicz - who considers himself a great authority. She couldn't cope with the disease - she was looking for specialists and then she went to Dr. Lewandowicz. Hild . she took it at 3 Piotrkowska Street. Unfortunately, she did not get to know each other either. Earlier she had been treating me at Ogrodowa Street with Dr Burczyńska for many years - a bad diagnosis was prescribed steroids. Somebody told me to do some tests for decalcified diseases. It turned out that I have BORELIOZA and she got me to the infectious ward in Biegański . They cured me there. She got 30 infusions of biotraxone and all the ailments were gone. The truth is that the disease is coming back, and I'm still healing myself. Thanks to that I can function normally. BORELIOZA is a disease that pretends to be different diseases. It can be like my case of RA, it can be multiple sclerosis, it can be neurological diseases, or parkinson, or many others. We patients may not know this, but celebrities such as Dr Lewandowicz or Dr Hild should at least rule out such a dangerous disease as BORELIOZA before they give steroids, or they will find that it must hurt because you are already 56 years old.

2228,"The Luxury Collection brand has tripled the number of hotels in its portfolio over the last decade, with 60% growth over the last five years. Marr adds "" Starwood has carefully selected the luxury hotels of The Luxury Collection, and we will also carefully select the independent, higher-standard hotels that will belong to the Tribute Portfolio. We want to make sure that the guests of our chain and participants of the SPG program will be able to expect the highest quality standard to which they were accustomed while staying in the hotels of our chain. Tribute Portfolio responds to the needs of participants of the SPG program - more hotels, more locations and a bonus of 10,000 points."
2229,Average hotel standard. Quite a nice service. The advantage close to the sea I recommend if you are not looking for luxury. Good communication with cities . Next to the Sopot Pier . Good breakfast in the Novotel standard but we are already used to it . There was a small problem with noise around 23 but the staff took care and you could fall asleep
2230,"A small hotel located in old Ankara. Ideal for trips ""to the city"" . The room is tiny, clean, friendly staff. The Museum of Anatolian Civilizations and Hisar Fortress are within walking distance. A few steps away is the Efez cold beer shop. . . ; ) Price is adequate to the level ."
2231,"I was with this doctor arrogant and arrogant, he wouldn't explain what is like to heal what are the symptoms of a young doctor who in his profession is not long willing to heal zero writes referrals for services which are for dates I have a pain in my groin something grew as I even walk it hurts, let alone how I'm gonna do something, the doctor has such an attitude and quotes his words if you don't have cancer and you don't threaten your life, then you're gonna wait for this service. I would never recommend it to anyone. I don't know why he hasn't complained about his attitude to older people, and his unpleasant and arrogant behaviour."
2232,"The hotel of the years of splendor is already behind us, we got a new room and after the general renovation so you can say that everything was on the level, the size of the room maybe 15 sqm, terribly small. In the hotel there is a big problem with the elevators waiting time for the lift from 10 - 15 minutes and the time of descent from the ninth floor of about 10 minutes stands literally on each floor, the hotel eternally renovated at least from February this year to the end of November. There are only two lifts in the building and the second two for the builders. Breakfast is poor, service at a good level. Parking in Stary Browar about 20 meters from the hotel. I do not recommend!"
2233,"We were 4 days with children and friends with 2h aquapark option and breakfast. The rooms were like in a dorm, we had a double room and 2 extra beds - tight. Room equipment absolute min . The hotel is not connected to the aquapark and the restaurant. You have to get dressed and undressed to get somewhere. Additionally expensive. The service is like in the commune but it is standard in the Czech Republic. I do not recommend, look for another place, even further away from the ski lift - the transport is well organized."
2234,"This is the first time I've been to your doctor's and the opposite. . . . .she hasn't met me with any calls or ill-treatment. . . The doctor talked to me normally, everything was fine. I recommend it. Oh. . . . .but it's gentle and it's important. 100 PLN for a visit is a normal price. . . . .she paid me more. So I don't see any reason why she shouldn't advise this gentleman..."
2235,"At first the hotel greeted me with a poor access - GPS led me along a road that ends with a barrier at a private property and at the reception desk I found out that the road that leads directly to the hotel is not listed in Google Maps, a small banner on the main road leads to the hotel. Next to the Best Western Hotel building there is a building called Melodia, it is not known whether it is a hotel, a guesthouse or a frightening building, in any case Best Western hotel guests eat breakfast there! The building stopped in the late Polish People's Republic and with such a price for the stay it is a bit embarrassing. To get to the hotel, you have to pass through the railway tracks. Trains going there are terribly noisy, in the season you can charge them at least two per hour, until 11 p.m. you can't sleep with the window open: ) I have found a room 221 - beware! The room is adjacent to the social room on one side and the laundry room on the other. Until about midnight the washing machines go there all the time, and skillfully placed ventilation grilles perfectly carry the whole noise - another reason for insomnia. The pool with hot water, the possibility of spending the holiday with your pet, the possibility of renting bikes, good coffee, close to the beach, free deck chairs and screens."
2236,"In the countries of the European Union, it is done ok . 900 000 hernia operations per year . The treatment consists in discharging the contents of the hernia sac into the peritoneal cavity . This stage is common for all types of hernia surgery. There are differences in the way of supply, i.e. simply closing the so-called hernia gate. There are two basic types of hernia supply - voltage supply with own tissues and voltage free with hernia meshes of different shapes and materials. Most often a hernia is treated by sewing a surgical mesh of polypropylene in a rocket or foot shape into weakened tissue. On such a scaffolding a weakened part of the body can regenerate. Progress in the treatment of this type of diseases is based on limiting extensive surgery in favour of laparoscopic procedures. During the surgery with a minimum incision, a rolled-up mesh is introduced and developed inside the patient's body."
2237,"The research will use the most modern techniques of molecular biology. Strączkowski estimates that the laboratory should start operating within the next two months. The analyses of blood and tissues, e.g. fat will be carried out. The research will be carried out within the framework of already conducted research projects, but the scientists will also apply for new grants for this purpose. For example, the facility has already carried out one project on weight loss, weight reduction in obese people based on dietary factors and intends to carry out more. Strączkowski said that the scientists wanted to be present in the Białystok Science and Technology Park, because the laboratory where they will work there is from the beginning designed and prepared taking into account all the requirements related to the standards of scientific research. ""These are very demanding research in terms of designing the premises. It was adjusted to our needs"" - stressed Strączkowski ."
2238,"A professional doctor, he knows what he is talking about, he answers every question I ask very exhaustively. As the only one of many doctors I have visited recently, he has informed me what tests I should do after a miscarriage. The only drawback is the cost, but a good doctor should appreciate it."
2239,"We were with a child of 5 at the end of June 2017. A huge, impersonal hotel. Nice decoration, super pools for adults and children on two levels. A brilliant brine pool, you can go outdoors. Very kind Mr. Masseur in SPA and Mr. Peaceful Ukrainians. Minus: service at the reception desk KOSZMARNA , with a few exceptions! ! ! The lady who is the boss of the shift speaks the tone of a bartender in the People's Republic of Poland, without a smile and does not force herself to be polite. They bought us a room of a higher standard, but we were given a cheaper one, lying straight to the eye that the rooms may vary a bit. After intervening with a higher manager, it turned out that we were right. But we had to move twice in 8 days. There are crowds of young people walking around the dining room (waiter service), without the ability to contact a living person (I suggest you teach the staff how to kindly ask a guest if he can take a plate). The food is good and varied. In general, the hotel is recommended for people who like to travel all inclusive in large hotels in Turkey."
2240,"The first starters were quite heavy, weighing 140 grams and only worked for two years. They were 2.5 cm thick. They were emergency - when the resin burst, they stimulated the heart too quickly, which was dangerous for the patient. In the second half of the 1970s the working time of these devices was extended to 5 years, which was a huge progress. The exhibition also showed a dummy atomic stimulators, which could theoretically work for 30 years. They were driven by plutonium. The electrodes were less durable, therefore their service life was estimated at over 15 years. They were large and complicated, producing high internal temperature up to 300 degrees Celsius. C . They cost from 6 to 7 thousand dollars."
2241,"It's hard for me to say anything about this phone call because I received it today as part of an extension of my contract with the operator. The phone is brand new, pre-packed and . . . . . . .is defective! ! ! does not start up, any attempts of buttons, reset, charging with different chargers do not cause anything. The handset is dead without any life signs. For me, it's a massacre that a brand new premium product is defective. The Samsung quality control on production does not work, I am willing to give up this brand because I am afraid of what to do next."
2242,"In the first half of this year the most often, because as many as 17 times he traveled on business ""statistical"" German, less often Frenchman - 15 times, least often British - 13 times. Average number of trips in the first half of 2012 . - 16 (including 12 domestic and 4 foreign), was the same as a year before . It is worth noting that the British most often indicated location as the main criterion for choosing a facility - 70% . The most important hotel services were the location of a comfortable bed (67% in France and 64% in Germany). ( French - 65%, Germans - 73% . ) . The elections of this nation therefore proved to be the most consistent with those of women . The British are also the leaders in booking hotels through their websites - 64% . The French and 30 % of the population. The Germans ."
2243,"I recommend treatment for those men who have a hamster, slightly drooping cheeks and nasal furrows. I decided to have the so-called ninci hyaluron procedure - dr . Jamont is on the list of surgeries so she decided to do it, all the more so because she had done mesotherapy and lower eyelid plastics earlier (revelation) and I am satisfied. I'm 2 days after the surgery and I can really see the facial oval improvement. I recommend"
2244,"As emphasized by the organizers of the action, in Poland, every hour someone finds out that he has leukemia, a blood cancer. This diagnosis is heard by parents of small children, youth and adults. Regardless of age, anyone can fall ill. The Marrow Donor Day action is to make us realize how little is needed to save someone's life. ""This action fills an area of ignorance - its main aspect is social education. It will help everyone to find out more about the problem and we feel that there is a great deal of lack of information: we don't know how or where to report our own admissions, how to collect biological material. I think that as a result of this campaign more people will sign up as potential bone marrow donors and as a result more people will be cured"" - said the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the Jagiellonian University, professor Maciej Małecki ."
2245,"I was at that hotel some time ago. Being in this hotel is one of the worst experiences. The hotel is a relic from the communist era. Its years of glory are long gone. Walls, floors in a nightmarish state. In the room millions of ants and other vermin walking right next to the bed . The bathroom wasn't in good condition. The rooms were for the less demanding people. WiFi rarely worked in the rooms, more often in the lobby. As for 'all inclusive', I don't know how someone dared to call it that. The food is terrible. Every friend of mine, including me, was sick of it. The only thing that's virulent is the watermelons that you eat for every meal, breakfast cakes, or chicken a'la gyros in sauce, which during my 2 weeks was only 2 times. This is not a restaurant but a canteen with trolleys on plates. Every day you had to eat out. Juice is some kind of artificial beverage filled with chemistry. The water that was also available in the hotel had a taste of something like petrol. The ONLY PLUS is the area. Great for young people . A mass of clubs, bars . It is also not the most expensive in shops. You can go there by yourself and you will definitely not get bored. A lot of positive people . The sea is not azure, but pleasant, warm and clean. The beaches are also ok. Recommended for people for whom no matter where, but important with whom, and just to sleep and bathe, have a rich nightlife. The surrounding area is one big fun. For those who appreciate hotels - one big massacre."
2246,"We came to the Riva del Garda late at night. A very nice owner explained to us the location of the free car park, which was only a few minutes on foot from the resort. When we returned, she showed us a large private room with a bathroom and explained everything. The room was cleaned daily. The guesthouse is located in the centre of the town on one of the busy narrow Italian alleys very close to the lake. Under the rooms there is a popular restaurant of the same name where breakfast is served in the morning (coffee, bread, fresh fruit, juice, ham jam, cheese). Although the description of the hotel was written that on Wednesdays breakfasts are not served, it turned out that during the season are (unfortunately, we found out after the fact ;) ) . To sum up, we had a very pleasant time and on our next visit we will be happy to stop here again."
2247,"Almost 3 years ago I had a godforsaken nose surgery - lifting the tip. I chose this doctor because I heard that he doesn't make big changes and that's what I wanted. Before the surgery I repeated 3 times that I like my face, I said that the most I like the nose between the eyes is how it connects to the forehead and that's why I don't want to break it. So we decided not to break it because I have a small nose and I didn't want a smaller one and we just lifted the tip, I admit that I have a pretty tip but as for the bones the doctor pinned it on me even though I didn't want to and the worst thing is that he also pinned it between my eyes, which made my nose unnaturally thin and not fit in my face. My face has changed dramatically, especially between my eyes, I have eyebrows close to me now and I look just weird. I was at his place a month after the surgery and he said that he wasn't watching high up there, but I think the man knows his face. so I let go of him. in october I will have a bone transplant in france and maybe raise my eyebrows or rather stretch them. I don't say that the man is a bad doctor because during my stay in the glade I saw satisfied patients with nice noses but there was also one who looked much better before the surgery and fit her wider nose. I knew that the doctor liked straight noses and that's why I marked my nose passage into the eyebrow gaps to stay and not to do anything there. At the front of the bones looked similarly to the letter V, wider at the forehead, which was collapsing downwards and the connection to the adventure was already very thin, now I have something of a style and a simple dash firm for you."
2248,"A shrill parody that shakes the basics of youth culture, not saving any of the horrors, none of the films about the sexual adventures of high school students, the action film, and even the gags themselves. Breaking the concept of good taste, STRONG FILM parodies pop - cultural parody with unstoppable virulence attacking the most popular styles and loud moments of recent films, television and commercials. The film boldly mocks classic scenes from Screaming, Sixth Sense, Matrix, Last Summer's Nightmare and The Blair Witch Project, and then goes on to parody a whole host of clichés from teenage cinema, regardless of genre. It all starts with the murder of a beautiful high school student, after which a group of derailed teenagers - played of course by 20 to 30 year old actors - discover that there is a killer between them. The main character and her friends must protect themselves from danger. . . . . .and an annoying reporter, Gail Hailstorm, who keeps them busy. The film is set in an old house where a mad professor (Tim Curry) secretly lures a life-satisfied student Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) and her adventurous friends under the pretext of conducting a scientific experiment. The house is ruled by an old butler of gold ( Chris Elliot ) . The crazy professor is helped by an equally crazy Dwight ( DavidCross ) , ready for anything for the sake of the experiment. The extraordinary and over-programmed photos are the foundation of a whole series of terribly funny events."
2249,"I'm 3 pregnant and I'm not complaining : ) fact 1 baby miscarried m , but it was neither my fault nor the doctor's - the fetus did not develop and after the first ultrasound the doctor noticed the abnormality and had it checked again. During 2 pregnancies she had spotting and if necessary an ultrasound was performed. The fact that later on it was not performed often but still. 3 pregnancy just started . I am not complaining . dr has a specific sense of humor he has but it suits me : )"
2250,"in class, everyone does what they want.) on 4.5 it's enough to go to classes and on 5.0 it's enough to go to the classes."
2251,"The doctor has a well-equipped office, she is nice but the contact with the patient is very average. In case of bigger health problems, it is difficult to get specific information about further proceedings and treatment. Unfortunately I am not satisfied with the visit. I will consult my health condition with another doctor."
2252,"Luke M . ( 10 . 03 . 2015r ) Hello. I would like to share with people in need of psychological help, my experience related to the therapy with Mrs Adrianna . In 2002 I was worried about my health. As it later turned out, the problem lay in my psyche, namely, I was diagnosed with anxiety nerve, which manifested itself in various ways. After a visit to a psychiatrist, I took up pharmacological treatment. And yes, the strong anxiety attacks subsided, but there was constant anxiety before the relapse. In 2012, I decided to visit Mrs. Adrianna, people who recommended me as a psychologist in the superlatives, were absolutely not wrong, as I found out myself after the first visit, to which I went a little worried. The approach of your psychologist to the patient for me was unique, the anxiety quickly subsided, em came out after an hour like a newborn man who is not affected by mental problems. Mrs. Adrianna is a very warm person, always smiling during the therapy, which causes mental comfort and relaxation, which probably helps to ""open"" your problems in front of the therapist. I think I could still do a lot of good writing about Mrs. Adrianna's therapy, I suggest that you convince yourself to those who need help SPECIALISTS. (not an amateur with diplomas) I'll say yes, I'm healthy, confident, without fear, thanks to Mrs. Adrianna , whom I sincerely thank . I highly recommend . p . s . Mrs. Adrianna, I will soon be in touch, in order to give away the books, and I will boast about my health. Greetings Luke . : )"
2253,"The heaters are nice but have hopeless thermostats without memory settings and programming possibilities. You can only correct the factory settings but until the first power outage, then everything will return to the factory settings. Besides, the thermostats are very easy to jam and the heater gives as much as the factory has given. Of course at the owner's expense. Radiators are practically not suitable for heating rooms without constant supervision. One more time they make strange noises during operation and it is quite loud. Maybe it is a remorse for what he designed them."
2254,"Unfortunately, I'm not happy to see Dr. Borg. I already had a positive result in my first visit with previously made allergic tests. Despite these results, Dr. Bargo said I was not allergic. Dr. was distracted, the interview was very chaotic. The fact that I was not allergic to anything was stated only on the basis of the conversation he had with me, without even looking at the test results. And my cough has been going on for about 3 years now, very often I get sick, I still have a sore throat, I often have a stomach and headache and generally feel weak. And this is not asthma because I have also been tested in this respect. The fact that I don't have asthma has strengthened Dr. Dr. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S. S.

2256,"Unfortunately, I confirm the previous opinion. Pain during gastroscopy is terrible, in contrast to the previous ones - done in the hospital on Borowska or Hirszfeld. She got m assigned Colon C and diet . A few months after the examination she landed m in the hospital with colon cancer. I really advise against the doctor! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
2257,"The doctor writes down the antibiotic for all the ailments at once, he also does not like to send it for tests. Therefore, the body is weakened, the disease is still recurring, and I do not know what is wrong with me. The advantage is that she is really very nice and gentle in dealing with the patient."
2258,"All day long I'm fighting to install the device on Windows 10 64bit . Something so hopeless hasn't seen em . Only when you read the Internet forums you can see that Canon can't handle this version of the system. The configuration with WiFi support is lost when trying to install the scanner. Connecting via USB also doesn't do much good because I haven't been able to scan anything for 4 hours! I would like to point out that I have been working on computers and such devices for several years. Lexmark, HP, Epson is a fairy tale compared to this device! It is a pity and embarrassing that since July 2015. Canon has not improved the driver - rested before Windows 10 and before the fixes to Windows 10 . I advise against it ! I will never buy Canon's device again ! Nightmare !"
2259,"They visited our Zdrój Wojciech only for consumption. The restaurant was advertised as a historic restaurant, but it turned out to be a tighter, bigger room on the first floor in the style of this rather than that of the time. There was no climate. Apart from the spa building itself, nothing seemed to indicate that we were in a historic place. The service was nice, but terribly twisted. I felt a bit like an intruder who is disturbing something undefined. We waited for a long time, because more than 30 minutes for a soup, which was summer. Then the salmon wrapped in bacon tasty, but without any craze. In general I am disappointed with the decor and service, not delighted with the taste. It's quite expensive in price, not enough for the rest."
2260,"Nothing special. She brought nothing new into my nutrition. I believe that before you recommend a diet, you should first have any blood tests with hormones at the forefront because not everyone will lose a kilo quickly. A lot depends on the hormonal system. Deita and exercise alone aren't everything."
2261,"The window is dirty, the bedding is like a dog's throat removed. No paps, so you have to step on cold tiles with a wet foot. The staff does not speak Polish . Breakfast is good but expensive. Air-conditioning does not work . Water from the tap flew yellow . I advise you to think before the visit and check the competition . I do not recommend ."
2262,"The hotel staff is nice and helpful, the room is clean, but the walls seem to be made of paper - you can hear everything they do and say the other guests in the adjoining rooms. In addition, the disadvantage is the fact of close proximity to the railroad tracks - at night an oncoming train can wake up. In the room there are old couches with a sheet that is pulled down and annoying. On the plus side: free, large car park, tables with ashtrays in front of the hotel, close access to the city center (5 - 7 minutes by car), you can buy beer at the reception. Price: too high for this standard room."
2263,"The hotel's large but outdated outdoor architecture does not make a good first impression. The hotel is clean and modest without unnecessary fireworks for the show. Breakfast and dinner tasty and well prepared . The nationality of guests mixed with the predominance of Germans . Hotel focused on conferences and trainings . The room is equipped with minimum - definitely the floor - floor panels that do not give warmth to the general interior design. Bathroom - the curtain in the shower already eaten with a tooth of time - would be useful to replace. The big advantage are contacts close to the bed and there are no bedside tables by the bed, which causes the equipment such as telephone or other electronic equipment lies on the floor. Very good internet connection in the hotel - in my opinion it is a big advantage. Very fast lifts in the hotel. Very nice place for business meetings or training."
2264,"What active compounds did the medicines used in the Republic of Poland from the 16th to 18th century contain? Were the therapies biologically active enough to treat the ailments that plagued the patients of the time? The combined historical and laboratory research will be conducted by a team led by Dr . Jakub Węglorz from the Faculty of Historical and Pedagogical Sciences of the University of Wrocław. The project received PLN 1.57 million from the Sonata Bis programme of the National Science Centre. The subject of historical research will be old Polish diaries, letters, diaries and private notes. Historians will choose from them information about drugs used at that time. Then they will identify these therapeutics and describe them in detail on the basis of medical historical sources: prescriptions and compendiums. Prescriptions obtained in this way will be the basis for detailed reconstruction of old medicines."
2265,"Great guesthouse, wonderful service, delicious food (you can put on a lot of weight), great parties with highlander music, singing and bonfire. The place is also loved by children because there is a lot of them here and they tie themselves up friendly. The place is 100 % recommended."
2266,"Compared to other hotels of Irene Eris the one clearly stands out, in terms of restaurant service, which behaves as if she were tired, bored. When she asked m the waiter who was hanging around the umbrella to bring me salt and pepper, he looked at me with reluctance and started looking around, I guess looking for someone else from the service but there was nobody, eventually he said with displeasure, well I will bring it. The coffee got spilled, it felt as if I was in some subordinate bar. The pools and spas are renovated and look very beautiful. The rooms are not so cute anymore, the toilet seat in the bathroom had a broken toilet seat, the shower was very low and uncomfortable, soaping you had to watch out for the shower taps, a few times I hit it and additionally the water changed from hot to cold or vice versa, the sink was clogged. No mosquito nets in the windows, unfortunately mosquitoes were. The mattresses were also not the most comfortable, but apparently the rooms will be renovated in the autumn, so maybe this will change. Breakfast once delighted me in these hotels, this time I was disappointed, for a week still the same, even cakes, in addition to the low quality. The only thing that hasn't changed is the quantity, it's a pity that quality has been given up. For lunch she ordered me a fish and again a surprise, nothing special. She left me disappointed."
2267,"I have not yet encountered such a lie and cheating as in . in the hotel. The only advantage is the free airport transfer, nothing more. The night offered in the hotel far away thunderstorm cold and once again cold. The return of the money that did not arrive the night was to be made abruptly, executed.after a few days, and notify the police."
2268,"Meeting with Mr. Peter is one of the most interesting, most beautiful and at the same time most difficult adventures that took place in my life, I am not the best writer, but I can not fail to describe what happened to me. My therapy lasted a year. It took me a long time to postpone my decision to meet, but there comes a moment in every man's life that he is tired of everything and tired. My private life, problems in my family that I couldn't accept, stagnation, a relationship in which I wasn't happy, lack of courage to make any decision, lack of acceptance of myself - finally she understood that you have to ask someone for help. The course of the therapy was not easy for me, she was still only crying, there was silence that she could not stand, there was doubt on my part but in spite of all this Peter was next to me, waiting for me to be ready for a step further. I don't know how, I don't know what method, but I was able to ""break"" for which I thank you very much - this is called effectiveness. Finally I stopped fooling myself and started to listen to my person, my thoughts, my body. Thanks to the therapy she improved my relationship with my beloved dad, she understood how selfish she was, she underestimated what I have, that thanks to these wonderful people like my parents I am in this world. She got rid of my excessive perfectionism, became a more assertive person, started to discover my femininity, and most importantly, despite the problems, she learned how to face them and not feel sorry for myself. I know what I want, what is most important for me, what makes me happy : ) She stopped racing with life, with herself, she regained my peace - it is amazing for me! Mr. Peter, thank you very much for the opportunity to experience this adventure with you. Thank you for the good energy that you shared with me, for your patience, goodness, for your smile! For those who have any doubts, it is worth to take a step forward and ask someone for help - although I know that sometimes it is not easy. Greetings :)"
2269,"The Ibis Budget standard is hard to discuss, but I think something has changed in this hotel since my last stay in it. It's good to see that my comments have been taken into account. Daily changed towels, a towel on your feet when you leave the shower, even changing bed linen without reminders. Only the cleanliness of the carpets still needs to be improved, because sleeping in the room after a dog or cat is not the most pleasant. I hope that the new quality is due to the new management and is provided continuously and not just as a result of previous personal, bad experiences, targeted complaints and personalized improvement."
2270,"Well, I want more. . . . .like a sense of security and care. It's professional service and honesty that affects my judgement, and I'm not eager to praise, the day before sunset, I write it after experience of my side of distraction and leaving valuable items worth about 2000 PLN. She received my information before she realized I lacked it and was immediately sent back to my address. Besides, each of my requests, e.g. additional pillows or a defect, were not left without a positive outcome. Thank you for a pleasant stay in the apartment, for the SPA - educated staff, for the integrity of the staff and high quality of service. Of course also for the tasty dishes."
2271,"For the first time the competition was held in the Silesian Voivodeship, hence the plot of medical simulation scenarios was set in the realities characteristic for this region. In the competition called ""The Front Game"" the participants of the competition played the role of medical personnel who were called to the coal mine, where the pit collapsed due to a gas explosion. The competitors, assisted by mine rescuers, had to provide medical assistance to three injured miners. Two of them were in very bad shape, while the third one, named Ernest, was very lucky and did not suffer any serious injuries. However, he was not an easy patient, and his mental state was not a problem for the players. As SUM spokeswoman Agata Kalafarska stressed, this task surprised the competitors. Thanks to the cooperation with the Central Mine Rescue Station in the SUM Medical Didactics and Simulation Centre, it was possible to create conditions similar to the real ones that rescuers cope with during the action in the mines."
2272,"Some time ago, he turned 'em in to a doctor with a foreskin problem. First he got 'em ointment whose effects were short-lived. Then there was a procedure which probably resulted from the fact that Mr. Doctor was in a hurry, was not carried out exactly. The effect of this treatment is almost the same as before it was performed. Moreover, not the lowest cost of the visit (already described here on the forum) and the cost of the procedure itself, is a big money for me. I went to see a doctor reading flattering opinions about him. My opinion, after visiting him three times is rather different . Rather, I've experienced em ineffectiveness, haste and miserable effects, at high cost."
2273,"Good location: not far from Tauron Arena, 20 - 25 minutes walk to the Market Square, public transport at the hotel. Very nice and competent service. A large selection of tasty dishes and breakfast supplements. Slightly less banal room decoration than usual plus a bathtub. The only downside is a small car park underneath the hotel, it's worth to book in advance, around the city's parking meters."
2274,"Spacious and comfortable hotel near the beach. Next to the hotel aquapark with attractions for children and adults - we were in June - the hotel was not overcrowded and there was no problem with access to water attractions as well as deck chairs at the pool. Very tasty, fresh food, cooking show, themed kitchens. Evening attractions for children (minidisco and club during the day) and for adults. Great, friendly staff, clean, well-maintained, new infrastructure and equipment, very discreet air conditioning. In the hotel car rental (we took advantage of us) - we recommend - not expensive and solid. Near the hotel power plant with chimneys - we did not mind - there was no problem with unwanted smoke or smell etc. The beach is long, not too wide, encouraging to stroll along the coast. Near the hotel there are souvenir shops and a bus stop. The hotel is recommended especially for families with children."
2275,"Professional approach to the patient, great knowledge . Doctor's skin lesions are viewed from close up (not from behind the desk). A great doctor . The only downside is that once again I was not accepted at the time of the appointment (more than 40 minutes of waiting) and once again the doctor was not feeling well, she had the impression that she should rest and not accept patients."
2276,"A beautifully located hotel in the old town. Nice service . Double room quite large . Stylish furniture, comfortable beds. Despite the street was quiet. Bathroom was large, but the shower was fixed with a suction cup and still fell off. Dusty ventilation. A definite plus is breakfast. Big choice, nicely served. Coffee and tea to choose from. Very tasty. Generally a hotel worth a visit at a good price."
2277,"Hello, as many tourists this year, who in the 1st half of August had planned to stay in this hotel and took advantage of the offer of various offices, we were unpleasantly surprised during the chck - in / u, because we got a wristband, but we were offered for the first week of accommodation in another 3-star (said that a similar standard and that it has 5 Greek stars, and it was 10pm. 00) hotel. We were eventually offered to stay at the reception desk, at the Mitsis Hotel next door, 4 nights at the worse hotel in Kiotari and the rest at the Mitsis Rhodes Maris. We felt like a herd chased out of the desert and paid for it ourselves. It was our fifth stay in Rhodes, they flew us out of ITS, but tourists from other countries and other offices were treated similarly. The hotel itself is nicely located, the surroundings are faultless, the staff is more like it (as the tourists who did not quickly let go, they met the other face of some of the receptionists and we were not eager to argue, even when it turned out that they lied to us - they told them that we only lied: ) ) This is the third Mitsis hotel in which we have stayed and the first time we regret our choice. It is specifically about the menu and the animation program, especially in the evening. You can put it this way every other day - Swist's Day! At this price other hotels in Rhodes offer a much better menu and a better programme, so I don't think I'll ever see us there again - we know what a really successful holiday in Rhodes means. Greetings and wish you a successful choice!"
2278,"Extremely rude, arrogant and brazen ""doctor"" with zero approach to the patient, in this case the child. Instead of providing reliable information on the questions asked, he prefers to ridicule and treat the patient as an understated ram, emphasizing that ""his stethoscope cost several thousand and the diaphragm itself 700 zł"". ( words addressed to a six-year-old! ) . Apparently, the doctor is a world-famous specialist in every field, since when he sees a child for the first time, he listens to it and then prescribes an inhalation steroid, because he ""diagnoses"" an allergy (you don't know what it is) and claims that a consultation with an allergologist is unnecessary. It was my first and last visit to this gentleman and others and I advise you to avoid him with a wide arch."
2279,"This doctor has an additional specialization, the old man's reproofing, who barely goes up the stairs to his office, referring with nothing in very dramatic situations, with the explanation that today he has already made referrals, with remarks that this is not a butcher's shop, etc., he also learns quickly, somebody had to tell him or he invented it himself, that when you become a manager you stop saying good morning to patients, but you slam the door in front of them. He may be a good doctor, but so what? ? I think we are surrounded by enough straightforwardness, we don't necessarily have to look for it from our GP. I strongly advise against contacting this gentleman."
2280,"She added that gluten-free diet, which is popular among people who want to lose weight. When used without a medical indication, it can actually cause the loss of excess weight. However, this will only happen because everything that contains gluten, such as bread, pasta and starch products, will be eliminated from the menu. But it is often the case that instead of losing weight, those who are on a gluten-free diet will face an unpleasant surprise - weight gain. Gluten-free products that are available in stores instead of gluten contain fat and are therefore much more calorific and fattening. ""Protein in the form of gluten is replaced in gluten-free products by fats, which are a spare substance and will be deposited in our body"" - emphasized Natalia Drabińska ."
2281,"The visit concerned the scar, or basically strange traces (red dots), probably allergy to some component of cepan ointment to scars. The doctor stated that she would prefer not to write anything down because she doubts the effect of these preparations, and would not write down anything she is not convinced of, to avoid unfavorable comments that she is a weak doctor. . Finally she asked if it ""bothered me so much"". For a specialist in aesthetic medicine, a bit of a poor approach to the problem. In the end she received em a leaflet of over-the-counter ointment which probably ""can relieve irritation but, not necessarily because the scar is something permanent"". The whole visit lasted maybe 5 minutes, and cost 80 zloty."
2282,"The building also has a private beach. Room prices for Ocean Rooms start from 239 USD per night for two people, Ocean Suites from 359 USD and View Suites from 479 USD. Like many such large and complex suites, the building is opened in stages. The earliest, because the casino started operating in March, at the beginning some rooms were made available, and the official opening of the entire facility is scheduled for 25 May this year. The Revel Resort complex was built and equipped at a cost of $2.4 billion. The investor is the Revel Entertainment Group, in which 90% of the shares are held by the investment bank Morgan Stanley, however, assistance in financing the investment was provided by the authorities of New Jersey and Atlantic City."
2283,"Hotel building from the Gierek era, renovated but modernity pinned like a flower to a corch-horse, reception desk in the place of the former cloakroom, hotel parking on 20 cars around the hotel fountain with an added low kerb that threatens to damage the wheels of sports cars, the first surprise is the information that the sauna, We let go of parading without clothes because we had a jacuzzi in the apartment, another surprise is the requirement of the same costume, which means that we had to go naked in the hotel restaurant where we wanted to go to dinner, we had to order dinner in the room, the food was cheap for a hotel and really tasty. The third and last surprise was at breakfast. . . Guess what it was about. . . . Of course, on a costume that was BESTY, fortunately you could take the food to your hotel room. Breakfast for the hotel VERY PREVIOUS, the hotel is recommended for naturists or charming enthusiasts Mr. 50 +"
2284,"This theoretical model has gained much attention in the scientific community, reflecting the popular in recent years behavioural therapy of pain. However, the theory of pain as a learned behavior - emphasizes the interlocutor of PAP - does not yet have a solid foundation in experimental research. The results of the research that has been carried out so far do not allow us to unequivocally determine whether the hypothesis about learned pain is true. In the experiment planned by Jagiellonian University scientists, healthy participants will be subjected to the procedure of so-called causative conditioning, in which they will receive series of stimuli causing pain. When subsequent evaluations of the pain they experience will increase, they will receive positive reinforcement - rewards. However, if they are reduced, the participants will receive penalties. If the learned effect of the pain persists despite the fact that the applied stimuli are not actually ""painful"", the model of the learned pain will be confirmed."
2285,"Very good doctor. The advantages are: - he thoroughly examines, has a thorough history, treats well - explains, explains, explains, recommends appropriate examinations - he has a good office, he is admitted to the National Health Fund (few appointments) and he has a cheap prv. - He carefully leads the pregnancy, conscientiously fills in all the downsides: he accepts it for a long time, the queue is getting longer, but that means he does what he needs to do, he does not darken and does not tell nonsense, he only kindly gives information. I had 8 gynaecologists and only the one who trusted me."
2286,"We stayed in the hotel for 14 days in June. We go on holiday to Greece every year and know what to expect. This hotel has four stars we drove us to three stars and the standard was much better. The rooms in Grande Mare pretty nice . We got quite big, although at the end so we had to go over to the restaurant and the pool. If someone has trouble moving around, we do not recommend it because there are many stairs. Bathrooms like this in Greece . . . a small shower with a curtain sticking to the body . Cleaning ended with changing towels . For two weeks, even the toilet was not disinfected. But that's not such a problem because you don't spend your holidays in the room. The four-star hotel has probably only beautiful views from the window of the room as well as from the pool or restaurant. If in such a hotel you have to drink wine or beer for dinner or lunch in plastic cups in the restaurant is probably a mistake. The food is not the worst, but for two weeks we have not eaten anything Greek except souvlaks. Fish as a medicine. The tzatziki sauce was maybe twice, there was a lack of olive oil, feta cheese or Greek yoghurt. At breakfast we had a choice of light and dark baguette, one day there was only toasted bread, which was probably no longer valid and that is why they fed us. With twice the fried eggs and scrambled eggs and so it's just hard eggs and sausages. For lunch, when the tray with meat disappeared, they saved themselves and lectured what they had at hand. The service was still delayed and as if surprised that the food was still missing. The bald bartender at the pool giving you another drink asks if you have an alcohol problem. Two brothers, one waiter and the other bartender at the pool are fine. At the pool you can choose from vodka, ouzo, tsipouro and beer or wine. Coffee is hopeless unless it's paid from the coffee machine. Orange juice from the distributor also payable 5 euros . Beautiful surroundings, close to the beach. We recommend the one with an underground passage of peace and quiet and a set of deck chairs for 5 euros, hotel beach set for 6 euros. The hotel is on a very busy street and you have to be very careful when going to the beach. As for a four-star hotel it's bad and it's a waste of money."
2287,"The weirdest personality I've ever seen in luxmeda. . . . Very well, the doctor examined everything, referred her to the hospital etc ... but in general the impression was very strange. . . - She was m ofukana for not taking off the flip-flops while sitting on the gynecological chair (she was m at 9 months pregnant, her legs swollen so that she barely put these flip-flops at all, not to mention bending over. . . . .the heat was cruel. . . . . .no gynecologist ever paid attention to my shoes. - I was beaten 15 minutes sitting m waiting for the doctor to finish using the computer. She was convinced that she describes the whole visit in detail and writes recommendations. It turned out that in the recommendations she wrote only the need to go to the hospital. - A referral to the hospital was given to me with an indication of ""another weak contraction"". for which I was laughed at in the hospital because the problem was complex and consisted of something else. Generally - I recommend rather in emergency situations, but as the attending physician she would prefer someone with a better approach to the patient"
2288,"In the 21st century, I didn't think that there are still such rooms in the Polish People's Republic at such a price. She bought me for the family two nights during the 2014 holiday. We didn't stay for the second one anymore. Tragedy rooms, no TV or radio. At the entrance we were greeted by dirt. The bathroom calls for renovation - there is no curtain in the unlisted old window and everyone can watch you in all your glory as God created you. Towels are hard to call towels . Nobody cleans and takes away the garbage. The walls and doors are terribly jammed - every conversation in the hallway and you think the door is open. The only plus is the food - maybe without the great luxuries, but tasty - the fact that for breakfast after a while there was a shortage of bread and nobody reported, but tasty and homemade dinners. To sum up, my leg will never stand there again and I don't know how others can brag about staying in Kwissan for such a price. 150zł / wasps per day for such conditions is thievery . In nearby Malachi with an aquapark, a day costs 175zł with food in the form of a Swedish table and daily massage, cleaning rooms and daily exchange of towels, so what to admire - I think such opinions are written by the owner and his friends. Kwissane is a great way to avoid a long arch."
2289,"The process must be fast and intuitive. By the way, it is interesting to note that it is difficult to find a solution where the provision of payment card details would be sufficient, after all, it is tantamount to providing the person making the reservation. Electronic payments are already settled with us permanently. Therefore, in addition to the traditional card, we should remember to provide our guests with the possibility of PayPal payment, online or traditional transfer. We also leave the reservation option unguaranteed without the need to secure the payment. We should take them into consideration with a view to upselling. However, as mentioned above, do not exaggerate with the number of additional offers."
2290,"I confirm: - similar to the previous description, unannounced slugging with water into the vagina as well as other, sudden omissions - sick leave only after a certificate from the primary doctor. At a later visit she also claimed that there are no grounds for ZLA. (on discharge from the hospital - pregnancy is at risk) - for 2 months I have not had any basic tests ordered, even despite my request and the symptoms presented, which may indicate serious deficiencies - recommending a dietary supplement (recently on the market) without ordering tests that could suggest serious deficiencies. She did not even take into account that some of its ingredients duplicate with the vitamin preparation taken from the beginning of pregnancy. - Without more detailed research, she recommended a very serious medicine (evaluation on the basis of a single, not a reliable indicator, she did not even propose further research at her own expense). - arrogant, unpleasant, insensitive - answering private phone calls at almost every visit At the moment, I don't think of anything else as a visit to another doctor who will check my and my child's health as soon as possible. And above all, one that, at my request and concern, will not restrict access to basic examinations. It is a 10 - y negative, and this is a sign of something. I CHANGE MY DOCTOR AND STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST IT! ! ! ! ! Luckily, the cytology was taken somewhere else, but I can't imagine such a situation, that after the interference of this lady blood flows down my legs."
2291,"Only 18% of adult Poles go to work on foot or cycle to work, but it usually takes no longer than 15 minutes. Most people get to work by car or public transport . As many as 66% of adult inhabitants of our country, i.e. 19.6 million, do not make an active effort to move to or from work (or do not work at all, do not study, do not learn). The least active during the mobility to or from work are residents of large cities, which is probably related to a better public transport system. In smaller cities, physical activity is higher, especially for women."
2292,"Dr. Magdalena Mizerska - Kowalska reserves, however, that today it is difficult to determine how effective lactase will be in treating cervical cancer. ""So far, in vitro tests have been conducted using cell lines. In order to be able to speak about the efficacy of lactase in the treatment of cancer, it would be necessary to carry out in vivo tests, i.e. on the living organism - first on animals, and then clinical tests involving humans. Only then it will be possible to determine how effective and how strong this factor is"" - emphasises Dr Mizerska-Kowalska. However, for this, huge financial outlays are needed. ""Such research is a long-term work. If we obtain an appropriate amount of money for the research, it is possible to carry it out - I think, within a few years. Unfortunately, in the absence of funds, this research can be prolonged even for several years,"" he explains."
2293,"This is probably the worst gastrologist you can find. In July 2010 she was referred to the hospital with symptoms indicating directly on NCHZJ. The doctor told me to leave the Pentas, which she took me for a long time, to drink melissa and take enterol and no - spend forte on severe abdominal contractile pains. When the tests were done and the cuttings were taken, the results showed nothing characteristic. The doctor stated that it is certainly an irritable intestine, when weighing 42kg with a few years of anorectal fissure, I was not able to eat anything because everything was flying through me undigested. Fortunately, I found a great specialist who brought me back remission. It was not until this year that the disease appeared endoscopically and in clippings: Leśniowski's disease - Crohn. I want to warn you to watch out for this doctor. Having graduated from the medical academy and specializing in gastrology, he should know that you have to wait even 5 times for the disease to manifest itself. He has done me much harm."
2294,"Hotel De Goezeput was ideal for our needs during our visit to Bruges and after coming from the USA for the first time. The hotel is located within walking distance of the train station when you head to Oostmeers street (signposts are not too visible). We were warmly welcomed and reporting was easy and fast. We had to bring our suitcases to the second floor, but since we were only going through Belgium and France by train, we packed our lightweight luggage and it was a pleasant transition to the cosy corridors (my wife and I are almost 60 years old!). The room was a delightful room, with ceiling beams and an amazing view of the street outside the hotel and Market Belfry. The room was very large and the bathroom was clean and adequate. A walk to the center and through the quiet streets of the town was easy. I recommend this hotel to everyone."
2295,"I recommend Mrs. Doctor Zalewska - Gajek to every lady, she was leading my pregnancy on the first day of the NFZ and I must admit that every meeting was an Event, I was received with dignity, with appreciation, warmth, great attention, she got a lot of fantastic advice, Thanks to the doctor and her appointment of a midwife, who worked beautifully with me, allowed me to choose the position in which I want to give birth, protected my crotch, so that I did not have a crack or a little bit of it, I was not incised, my birth was as planned by me, completely natural. When I tell my friends, nobody believes that a doctor from the National Health Fund, to whom she did not leave a penny in an envelope, can be so wonderful and that the birth in Polish hospital conditions can be an intimate, solemn and worthy experience. And so was every visit I made to the doctor. It was always necessary to wait an hour or two even for your turn, but the number of ladies who want Mrs. Gajek to take care of them proves her competence. Many times I was taken in additionally, because something disturbing was happening and there was no place, she never sent me away and she witnessed how many ladies she treated in a similar way, although her hours of work were long gone and she should go home. Always smiling, cordial, sensitive, gentle, even before I got pregnant and the first time I got to her, she knew that if I go, I will want her to lead my pregnancy, my intuition did not disappoint me, my whole 9 months were exceptional, as well as every visit to the clinic at the Doctor's, who is a real doctor by vocation. Thank you, my husband and our son! ! ! ! !"
2296,"According to the hospital spokeswoman Agnieszka Deoniziak, a 7-year-old Paweł from Świętochłowice was operated on, who suffered from a very large - ""even extreme for such a small child"" - curvature of the spine. The procedure was necessary because the scoliosis tends to deepen, and untreated deformation of the spine at the chest section leads, among others, to respiratory failure, which may endanger life. According to a spokeswoman, the Olsztyn hospital specializes in this type of procedures, the boy's mother found out from the Internet. She had previously unsuccessfully sought help for her son in other facilities. The woman came from Silesia, because - as she explained - Paweł ""today he still moves on his own, but if it wasn't for this operation, he would soon be threatened by a wheelchair."
2297,"Hotel extended to XXL size, crowds of people, even school trips. Noise everywhere and construction or renovation under the windows. Screams from 6 . 30 builders calling in the traditional Polish way. Swimming pools - closed part . Although there are so many of them that it does not make much difference . Rooms - with this amount simply neglected . The ladies do not quite keep up with the thorough cleaning. The food. - Well. Cheap Turkey. Mass production . Meat in sauces pâté baking . Heavy food and then nights. Animations for children . . . No ! None ! The service is not available. One lady. . ."
2298,"Mr. Dr. Mmie very nicely talk about the lame, the lame, the medicines, the medical progress. He quotes the statistics - the general knowledge of the knowledge is sure and considerable. He tells the same story every time. . . He is not interested in the patient. He gives a lecture: / Unfortunately, in case of a real problem, he cannot act effectively and finally leaves the patient on his own. His approach is erased every month when it is good, and in case of serious exacerbation, deal with yourself. Because here the business for him is already weak and the risk grows. . . I don't recommend it."
2299,"The hotel is very far from the standard 4 stars. Quite tight . In the room broken door from the shower and smells of cigarettes . The advertised fitness center is 2 treadmills set up in front of the wall in which you can watch the pace for an hour. He would give m 3 stars but in the evening he ordered em to wake up . I had my phone unloaded, so no time measurement. Unfortunately I was not woken up"
2300,"I don't know if you can talk about the competence of a doctor if the visit lasts 5 minutes. . and even if I don't look at the pictures it says that I have a DAmon apartment (cost 6,000) in my apartment, then I will bring the pictures (only then I will check if there are no defects in my bones, etc.) and maybe one or two teeth need to be pulled out ( ??!!) . . and when asked what kind of system it is (because it's a big cost), she answers me to read it on the Internet. . and it turned out that I have problems with the pond, which the doctor didn't notice during these 5 minutes, I think she wanted to break the record in the shortest possible time to get the patient - a client 50 PLN for the visit. I think that keidys and maybe she was adhering to her work, and now it's already on the opinion that it's supposedly the best which confirms her price."
2301,"It is a good idea to take everything out of it, but you are not just going to get professional advice for pleasure. I do not know how it is at the clinic but in private it does not assume a file so surely for the next time he will not remember anything and the whole story should be told again. I wasn't personally impressed."
2302,"If I didn't have family support, I don't know what it would all look like. We moved here from Krakow and soon there will probably be five of us. My wife Marzanna ... ... a beautiful and rare last name. Perfectly suited to the reign of the court. Thank you on behalf of my wife, whose idea is SPA and Institute of Cosmetics. She has organized and runs this whole part of our business. . . Son Jacob - a graduate of management and marketing studies, is the head of gastronomy, Nicholas, who manages the hotel part of the hotel has studied with finance and management . The third one - Piotr helps us remotely from Cracow, where he still studies finance and accounting and law extramurally at the Jagiellonian University. He has a look at Kombornia from a distance, because he sees from the inside and from the outside differently."
2303,"We arrived to the hotel with a delay and from the very beginning we had unpleasant surprises waiting for us. The reception desk could not cope with the service of the guests. We stood for a few hours and waited for the key to the room. Generally, the hotel service is not bad, but the manager is terrible, Poles are treated differently than Italians (we were given e.g. hb bracelets and we had all inclusive, they still required cards from us). Menago walks around the hotel in dark glasses, in the last days with the owner of the hotel, who passed us ostentatiously and was able to say hello, but only with Italians. Breakfast is extremely poor, lunches and dinners are better. The hotel views are nice, but the rooms are NON-SMOOTHING - we did not have a safe, TV. Optional excursions are TRAVEL. The Resident of Ithaca was bringing us on the bus to Sicily and then she just left us in Sicily and said that in 3 hours we meet at the bus. The whole day trip and 3 hours on the spot without a guide! You could take a local trip to Sicily for 40 Euros, but the same resident said she would be without a guide then. So it seems that 20 Euros went into your pocket for sitting in the bus. The residents were hopeless, sucking up to the menagogue, couldn't cope with any problem, adopted the method of spying. In addition, returning to the trip to Sicily, we got a package of food from the hotel for the whole day - 2 sandwiches with toasted bread, water, apple and biscuits and so on. We never complained about holidays, but they were hopeless. This is the first time I have written an opinion about any hotel, but I want to warn people against unnecessary nerves. At the end I will add that there is no Wi - fi - problem was everything for them and when there was a problem the staff stopped speaking English!"
2304,"It's hard to keep up with all the changes that Google is making to hotel search results. This is due to the fact that some solutions are still being tested, some of them only concern selected locations, and others are being introduced quietly. This time, the change seems to be significant and for a longer period of time. Stupidity is not sent: ) The aim of the change is to enable hotels to control their own availability, rates and sales directly. With the commission model, instead of CPC. Without the help of intermediaries such as OTA and metasearch. The amount of commission is not known."
2305,Cold food bad waiters without culture weak hotel are better for less money treat guests better Surely we won't recommend big shortcomings of the hotel service we expect something really different
2306,"The pump bought 'em for the new house. After 2 years, the device fell down slightly, i.e. . after the service diagnosis, the coil in the tank probably unsealed, so that the pump does not work and repair it equals to replace the whole tank. Now I have an expensive DHW water tank for this, it is good that the stove bought em two functional because it would be m without hot water. As far as the use is concerned I will honestly say with the pump I have bigger electricity bills and smaller bills for gas from the railroad in the absence of the pump is the opposite. Next time it's good for the industry whether to get into the pump again or not it's better to get into the solarium. For the time being, as far as the heat pump is concerned, I'm on NO ."
2307,"Doctor, he's nice and friendly but unfortunately he didn't help me. She reported to me with a problem - 8 days of enduring menstrual bleeding. The doctor said that in a day/two the bleeding will pass by itself, nothing for me to worry about. 12 days later, when the bleeding was still continuing, I was taken to another doctor, and the symptoms did not stop until the 21st day after taking the medicines. After so many days of bleeding she was already exhausted."
2308,"He was an em patient for over 4 years. He had a very serious defect but it was no problem for the doctor. The full professionalism of the treatment included plaster models, photographic documentation and detailed consultations. The visits took place in a very friendly atmosphere, without hurry and nerves. The patient explains each stage of treatment clearly and transparently so that the patient gets rid of any doubts. The effect of treatment is indescribable. Complete elimination of the defect, so now I can enjoy a very nice smile. Absolutely to everyone with a clear conscience I can recommend the doctor."
2310,"The grantee checked whether a single molecule could be a cure for all diseases in this group. All polyglutamine diseases are caused by the same mutation, and potential therapists are now recognizing this mutation site - the extended CAG string. ""The potential therapies that m dealt with were just the non-coding RNAs. They wanted us to switch off the process of gene formation in the diseased cells, which has a long sequence of CAG repetitions. By excluding the mutated allele, we leave the correct allele for this gene. And only one - good - works, and bad does not work. Thanks to that the patient could recover"" - says Stroynowska - Czerwinska . As a result of the research, it turned out that depending on where the mutation is located - at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the gene - the effectiveness of the same examined particles is unfortunately different."
2311,"We had just returned from a 10 day stay with family and friends there were a total of 19 of us, the hotel rooms very old but clean it was the only plus because the rest are the same downside food of the worst kind and often old and stinking breakfasts every day the same lunches not acceptable at dinner was not better service in the canteen nice after a gentleman who watched over everyone and everything could not go outside to drink coffee one bar open from 17: 30 - 22 : 30 and another one by the pool from 10 : 30 - 12 : 30 and 14 : 30 and 14 : 30 - 17 : 30 no one cleaned empty cups of napkins etc. in the pool circle the hotel was only suitable for the elderly average age 65 + no attractions for children departure we had a room at 5 am to 12 noon we had to pass dinner no longer owed us although we came after dinner personally I do not recommend Marta with the family"
2312,"Welcome. Today, a few words about Hotel Rzymski in Poznan, the hotel is located in Poznan itself at Plac Wolnosci 5 minutes on foot to the Old Town, the hotel itself is decorated in an old building which gives it a charm, large rooms are clean and as in the ""old"" building high which has its advantages is simply cooler (no air conditioning), bathrooms are clean and spacious, breakfasts are tasty and varied, the staff is very friendly to guests, near the underground park with which the hotel works. I recommend it to families and business travellers."
2314,"The product perfectly holds the make-up all day and night. Although it does not necessarily work with oily skin. In this case, the whole makeup should be done carefully and matt the skin before applying makeup. Then it will hold half the night . . ; ) Of course, if at that time we are e.g. at a disco and we are dancing, then during this effort the face sweats and yet this makeup is not so perfectly lasting. But if there is no intense physical effort it is OK ; ) For dry or mixed skin - IDEALNY. Make - up keeps up all day and night ; )"
2316,"Clean, well-kept rooms. A spacious hall. The staff sometimes different times we found a nice girl who every time she passed by said ""good morning"" and another time we found a girl who we said ""good morning"" but she was buried probably in facebook and even did not pay attention to us. Breakfast is delicious and everyone will really find something for themselves, juices are delicious - not from carton or concentrate. Downstairs there was some kind of pharmaceutical party - but there wasn't in the rooms rather hearing that noise and we rested after almost 9 hours of travel by car."
2318,"We stayed at the hotel 3 times and each time we promised each other that we would come back again. We were guests in different rooms and each of them gives comfort in the form of spacious, well-designed interiors with a large bathroom (or two :). Spacious swimming pool area with a large swimming pool, recreational pool, 3 Jacuzzis and 2 Jacuzzis on the outdoor terrace. 4 saunas, relaxation zone, well equipped gym. It smells everywhere and is b . clean . Catering is another strong point. Great breakfasts and dinners - both served and served as a Swedish table. In a word, this is the hotel you want to go back to. I recommend and congratulate you on maintaining such a standard."
2319,"The doctor was leading my pregnancy, which did not go smoothly. She ordered all the necessary examinations and answered my questions. Maybe not always nice and smiling, but after all we all have better and worse days. I recommend with all responsibility! ! !"
2320,"We went to this facility for a Valentine's Day stay with the whole family, children aged 6 and 9 years. General assessment 3 . The decoration of the whole early 90s, the kitchen rather average without revelation . Big minus for misleading me because when I booked em info accommodation in building A is the main building where there is a restaurant and swimming pool and it turned out to be not true . . . Big minus also for misleading the information about the wi - fi network, which deficiencies are neither in building A nor in the hall of building B . Small rooms not functional but clean . Plus for a swimming pool area for children . . . Generally, if you don't care about a bit of luxury, you don't mind eating in the canteen of the People's Republic of Poland, you can visit this object, and if you are focused on quality and value for money, go online and find another object. ."
2321,"A quick visit, but in a friendly atmosphere. The interview was quite modest, but she added some information that seemed important to me and the doctor took it into account. The examination of the ultrasounds was quick, but probably enough to verify that everything is good. I recommend it, but I encourage you to prepare yourself well and write down all the important information you want to give to the doctor, because the visit lasts only 15 minutes."
2322,"With a clear conscience I can recommend this hotel if you need peace and quiet just here. Clean rooms comfortable TV, wifi, shower, every room with balcony. The food is very good and plentiful. The lake is close to sports equipment bicycles, boats, canoes. There are cottages, rooms and apartments. At the back of the hotel there is a forest with health tracks. And there's a pool."
2323,"Over the years, Krakow's hospital has been visited by the best doctors from all over the world, and thanks to the cooperation with Project Hope Foundation, Krakow's doctors and nurses have been doing internships in the best American facilities. ""Today, it is the employees of this hospital who can educate the next generation of personnel caring for the health of children. Buildings, equipment and apparatus are one thing, but without trained staff, there would be nothing,"" said Thomas Kenyon, President of Project Hope Foundation. Rector of Jagiellonian University prof . Wojciech Nowak emphasized that the whole university community is proud of the achievements of the Children's Hospital. He mentioned that during his studies and many times he was there. ""We have seen a different world, a beautifully colored, beautifully functioning hospital. But the most important thing was that we met wonderful people there in the 1970s who opened up our horizons. They showed us that one can treat differently"" - said the rector of Jagiellonian University prof. Wojciech Nowak . ""He also used the hospital's help in the most difficult situations for every parent, when a child is ill. Thank you,"" he said."
2324,"FIVE FINGER FINGERS We HAVE IN GENES The scientist explains that genes that regulate e.g. the number and length of fingers, activate during embryonic development and then usually ""go to sleep"". However, if they wake up at the wrong time or place, they can lead to disease phenomena. This property makes it possible to study the mechanisms of disease through research on the development of the body. ""We already know how to turn certain genes on and off at different times and thus, in a controlled way, we can, for example, regulate the number of fingers in experimental animals"" - declares Prof. Tylżanowski and supplements that researchers can already bring about the birth of a mouse with 14 fingers in one limb."
2325,"The above is a list of tasks that they perform on a daily basis, apart from their basic duties connected with serving guests at the reception desk - receptionists of many small 3-star hotels ""somewhere in Poland"". Is 1 . 400 zloty ""on hand"" with night hours and work on Sundays - is it much or little for doing all the above mentioned work? Should receptionists in a 3-star hotel do such work at all? The answer to these questions depends on several conditions: how big is a 3-star hotel, i.e. how many rooms and other areas it has; where is it located, how high is the attendance, and how does the seasonality look like. And finally: how do we approach the employee billing system. 160 room 3-star hotel located in the center of Warsaw, Wroclaw or Poznan, where the traffic of guests and clients lasts practically from 6 am. 00 am to 2 am. It is impossible to compare it to a 12 - 20 room holiday hotel located in the depths of the Warmińsko-Mazurskie Voivodeship or to a city hotel in a small county town."
2326,"Mathematical Analysis 1 , Mathematical Analysis 2 ( lectures ) Electronics ( AiR ) Definitely yes . You do everything you can to teach. Sometimes she cares more about it than you do. Always willing to help. It is worth to go for consultations with specific questions to specific tasks . Everything will translate so long until you understand. She will never mock that you come to her with a simple task. Lectures with lots of examples . Conducted very clearly . Colloquia, cards, possibly activity are not the simplest but learning and doing a lot of scripts you can easily have 5.0 . You can always ""read r"
2327,"After a short stay in DW Globus (fortunately for me) I advise against staying in the centre. Outside the area, quiet, with plenty of space and greenery, the resort stopped in the 90s. Small rooms, in the room a washbasin made of old equipment, separated by a k - g plate covered with the cheapest tiles. The rooms have a ""bathroom"" or rather a toilet with a shower. These are so small, stinking rooms that in order to satisfy the physiological need you have to move the old door to the cabin to make room for yourself (with the door closed there is no possibility of bending over). Bathrooms have not been renovated for at least 20 years. In the cabins, mould and fungus in the places after the joints, cracked old tiles . In places of missing tiles sloppy cement holes . Window sills lined with the same tiles as in bathrooms, cracks glued with adhesive tape . In the renovated rooms (as I read in an earlier review) only new beds with new mattresses were inserted. Unfortunately, duvets and pillows remember the ancient times. The so-called apparatus is equipped with two joined beds (newly replaced) one old, not unfolded child's bed and sold as a bed for adults. In the second room, about thirty years of rest: 2 old sunken armchairs and a sofa bed, which collapses, and when unfolded, you have to support as much as possible - I supported the suitcase so that the bed would not fall down. In addition, you sleep to feel all the transverse planks . The rooms are charged the same amount as a normal bed, there was no proposal to reduce or negotiate the price even as an extra bed. I am ashamed of myself that I had to sleep on such stinking madejo beds and still pay for it. In such cases you should have charged only for the food, which was tastefully good as the standard is varied. Dinner is not recommended. Portions as for colonists or in sanatoriums. Facilities adapted and adapted for colonial stays. There is a café in the building, it is a pity that it is closed. There is also a swimming pool (pool), unfortunately, the entrance to the previous registration. It was not possible to enter the hotel guests when they felt like bathing, of course during opening hours. The cenrtum of the town is very far away - for some it is a plus, for others, older people, not motorized - a nuisance. The building has several buildings connected to each other. At the time when the facility hosted a colony was organized. Unfortunately, instead of children, the other hotel guests in one of the buildings were mixed together. The colonists' nighttime activities were very difficult. During a few days' stay in the rooms, nobody was cleaning. No fridges in the rooms."
2328,"The hotel offer of the Small Tricity, i.e. Reda, Rumia and Wejherowo will be expanded this summer by the Faltom Best Western Plus hotel located in Rumia. The facility will offer 46 keys (40 rooms and 6 suites), equipped - which becomes an indispensable standard for facilities of this class - with LCD TV sets, fridges, a safe, hair dryers and wireless Internet access. The investor is Tomasz Falkowski, the owner of the Faltom SPA hotel in Rumia and the Faltom guesthouse in Władysławowo. The anticipated cost of the investment is over 15 million PLN ."
2329,"We went to Primavera because I read positive opinions about this facility because it is not a HOTEL! The size of the room is very small, as if after renovation, but you can see the poor quality of workmanship and materials. Animations are the only plus - the lack of weather we had for a whole week. The kids were not bored. Aqua park - I don't know who dared to call it that - aquaparks are in Italy, Turkey and not frames. One slide and so many of the attractions. In the rainy weather taboos of people, after 2 hours in line they were eager to go in, so they refused to go there because of the pistons, the water nasty chlorinated! And last but not least about the food: something terrible, the quality of the food is below zero, the shit is at its maximum, although watching people some of it did not bother, anyway, reading the opinions here some people mention the massacred food but there is also a group of people who liked it. The service was provided by some bloated manager without a smile, people are not the time to treat a clientele like that. The price is too high or even very high for such a facility, they still ask for a vote for a family-friendly hotel as they are not a hotel! ! !"

I can recommend it to anyone who has an aneurysm..."
2331,"Diagnostic pathomorphology, which uses primarily the microscope, allows to examine the structure of cells, tissues and organs. It is up to the pathomorphologist's assessment to decide whether the patient should be treated with an anticancer. Other methods are only auxiliary - they give an initial diagnosis or confirm the pathomorphologist's assessment. ""The microscopic image even allows to determine what is the patient's chance for survival"" - says prof . Olszewski . Pathomorphological diagnostics has a large share in the assessment of the disease severity, as well as in forecasting and supervising the course of the disease. The choice of therapeutic methods and even the strategy of treatment depends to a large extent on it: whether it should be started immediately, or it is better to wait and do more research. ""It is necessary not only to determine the histological type of the cancer, but also to find its genetic mutations,"" he adds."
2332,"The hotel as an object (older, villa part) is one of the nicer ones, in which it was a part of the city. The new pavilions (pink) are modern, but do not fit in with the rest. But they are clean, simple, generally Ikea rules: - ) The hotel is clean. Swimming pools, floors, washed and cleaned daily. It is worse with rooms. . . Our room was very poorly cleaned, in beds there was all the time sand from the beach, linen was not changed. In addition, there are no plates hanging on the doorknob (do not disturb), so it happened several times that the cleaning lady came to our room when we were just getting dressed, or our son was asleep. It bothered us a lot. An additional disadvantage of the hotel is the noise, daily animation and loud music in the pools. Generally from 9. 00 to 22 . 00 - 23 . 00 (that's when the last parties ended) all the time something is playing. . . Eating like this in a hotel with all-inclusive offers. Monotonous and without madness, but we did not poison ourselves with anything, and the dining room was clean. They have a sensible menu for children."

2336,""" Molybdenum - 99 is the basic material for the production of technetium - 99m generators. The obtained solution containing radioactive technet - 99m is in turn a component of diagnostic kits used in scintigraphy of the brain, kidneys, heart or bones. It is a gamma-ray emitter with an energy of 140 keV with a half-life of approx . 6 hours. 80% of medical procedures performed worldwide are performed with the use of 99m technology - reminds the director of NCRD, prof . Krzysztof Kurek . - Although the production of molybdenum - 99 was dominated by four companies, we are working on an investment which will allow us to have every element of the whole process. Now we have a reactor irradiating uranium disks and the POLATOM Radioisotope Center producing generators of technetium - 99 . We lack a processing laboratory. ""For physical reasons (half-life) and economic reasons (transport costs), the processing laboratory should be built near the reactor. Polish scientists are preparing a project for this investment, but its estimated value is 35 million euros. NCRD is trying to obtain appropriate funding. The investment would be located in Świerk, next to the MARIA reactor (irradiating uranium disks) and OR POLATOM (producing technetium generators - 99m) . An additional advantage of such a location is the proximity of the Radioactive Waste Disposal Plant, which would receive radioactive waste produced in the process of molybdenum extraction - 99 . The new investment could be made within three years and thanks to it Poland would become a tycoon on the nuclear medicine market worldwide."
2337,"In my opinion, a good doctor is a good doctor, factual, specific and knows his trade. He was leading my pregnancy, which went well, but I cannot say the same about the birth. I was tired at 7 or 5 hours and everyone said ""it will be over soon"". but the end wasn't coming until the expert, Dr. Bishop, showed up. Kolczewski this suffering was over and thanks to him my daughter appeared, who will soon be two months old."
2338,"We stayed in a renovated palace for one night in the executive room, the overall impression we have is good, but there were some mistakes. It gives 4 stars for encouragement but should give me 3, 5 points as what, but Bialcon owners should more control the quality of the services offered. The service is very nice, helpful and friendly, the surroundings of the palace as well as its interior is also very pleasant, for these qualities gives full 3 stars. However, we have reservations to: the bathroom (a deserted and uncleaned shower cabin, the lack of tape on the toilet seat, informing about disinfecting the toilet, the lack of decorative bend on the first leaf of toilet paper) The door leading to the corridor (no floor slat under the door, resulting in the transfer of sound from the corridor to the interior of the room). and hotel cushions (cool that there are two sizes, but they are so hard that you can't sleep on them). Another note is that the ironing board is left in the hallway. I also do not recommend the specialties of Bialcon / Manufaktura Cieleśnica, in the form of jam, we have acquired several and we are disappointed."

2340,"My opinion of Dr. Warecka is very low. For 2 years she has not been able to rebuild my immunity, she was able to give me in 6 months about. 10 antibiotics . Moreover, recently she has not admitted me to the office but in the waiting room she was able to say ""why you came to the simulators again I do not have time and she does not accept"" and she locked the door in front of me. I went to another doctor and he diagnosed me and I didn't need andybiotic brothers as Dr. Warecka always did without even examining. I was once given an antibiotic by Dr. Warecka, which upset my whole body and its substance will disappear only after a few years."
2341,"The test is comfortable, but the analysis of the test material - a little less. The video recording from the capsule takes up to 8 hours. The doctor must look through this long video carefully in search of abnormalities in the digestive system. The Polish company CTAdventure, thanks to funds from the National Centre for Research and Development, is working on GastroView software for image analysis. It will capture in the video the fragments that the doctor should pay special attention to. ""The use of our software is to enable efficient and reliable analysis of films made by means of a webcam placed in the capsule - says David Jereczek from CTAdventure in an interview with PAP. - This will shorten the time needed for the analysis of the recording and reduce the number of hours that the doctor has to spend on it"" . PAP's interlocutor claims that the program would choose fragments from the whole material, which should be given special attention. Now the examination with the use of an endoscopic capsule may cost even 4 - 5 thousand PLN . Jereczek believes, on the other hand, that if the software was used, the cost of the examination could fall by at least half. ""It is possible that one day such tests will be reimbursed. And then more people will be able to afford prophylaxis"" - hopes the PAP interlocutor."
2342,"The super location that made the choice - a compromise between a reasonable distance to the center and the beach, and at the same time far enough away that noise does not disturb the peace at night. The owners were very nice. They inspire trust and advice. Breakfast is included. No frenzy but you can eat. Clear. The rooms are cleaned daily. Great value for money: 608 € for 8 days ( 2 people ) ."
2343,"We spent 4 days with our family in Ustroń staying at Koba Villa. The building looks very good indoors and outdoors. Rooms with tidy standard equipment such as TV and towels in the bathroom. Very nice and friendly staff, parking without reservations monitored. Children's room well equipped with toys, including table football: ) . The minus is a monotonous breakfast, still scrambled eggs and sausages, no hairdryer in the bathroom, little soap. Deserved 4 / 5! I recommend"
2344,"So far it is not known what the gene has to do with alcohol suicides. Prof . Rumour has it, however, that alcohol in people with this gene variant can cause worse moods, and so these people can more often ""get sadly drunk"", which in extreme cases can even lead to haggling over their lives. Perhaps some suicides in people with this gene variant might not have happened if they were sober. As the scientist admits, this variant of the AUTS2 gene occurs in quite a large part of the population. However, this does not mean that each of these people drinks less alcohol than the others and that they are less able to handle alcohol. The relationship is more subtle. The discovery of Poles cannot be used to designate people who might have suicidal tendencies after alcohol, but rather it is intended to help understand the genetic conditions of the impact of alcohol on the body."
2345,"I'll say yes, maybe if Windows 10 wasn't there, it's even a bit mediocre - but with this limited system and multitude of programs you have to upload to communicate between the contact list and text messages it's sick how you can destroy a good phone with an idiotic system that doesn't bring anything to communication - (it updates for hours) and it doesn't give anything. The more so-called improvements the phone tolerates each other, the more the system is destroyed and you have to do a restoration. I do not recommend to people with weak nerves - just * * * * * * * , will not buy anything more from windows 10 . I do not recommend"
2346,"I highly recommend the Doctor. After many years of constant feeling of fatigue, she led me "" on the straight "" . She started to make me function normally. She looked at my ailments and commissioned me to do some tests, from which she found out that not only do I have problems with my thyroid gland, but also great deficiencies of vit. D3 and magnesium in my body. All this together caused me to feel very bad, to lack the strength to act. After four months of taking medication, I am alive again, I want to be strong and I have strength. Moreover, the doctor makes sure that cytology and mammography are done. On-site ultrasound, gynaecological examination, you can also donate blood for examination. It works comprehensively. The bathroom next to the office, additionally equipped with hygiene inserts, disposable slippers and skirts gives a sense of comfort. It is an additional ""trifle"", but it shows the care of the patient, also in another aspect. Very, very much recommended! ! !"
2347,"The Doctor was nice, she listened carefully. The visit didn't really last 30 minutes but less. A short interview, pulse test, language, listening. Prescribed herbal medicines and acupuncture. In my opinion it's too early for the evaluation, I'm waiting for all this to work, but I'm positive."
2348,"Because of this doctor my mother is in a very difficult condition, she is already in hospital for a month and waiting for an operation that may save her life but her bad condition still drags her away. I warn everyone about this gentleman. I do not recommend to anyone who values his health and life! ! ! ! !"
2349,"It gives two points only because of the delicious food served beautifully. The rest below criticism, dirty playroom, broken toys. Water in the cold pool, dirty in the changing room. At 24:00 when I wanted to take a shower it was cold water and unfortunately in the morning it was not better. Just on the day of my stay, the snow fell, the stairs were not covered with snow - very slippery. We checked out after the first day, although the stay was scheduled for 5 days. The lady at the reception desk was unpleasant and had a nasty conversation with her. But that's a plus for a very kind waiter! We cared most about the playroom because we went with two small children. For the sake of clarity I attach photos from the playroom."
2350,"The doctors from Olsztyn do not yet know why SLA patients react differently to stem cell therapy. According to their preliminary assessment, this was not influenced by the age of the patients who took part in the experiment. The full effects of their research will be known in a few years. Atrophic lateral sclerosis is an incurable disease consisting of destruction of nerve cells responsible for the work of muscles, including respiratory muscles - at some stage of the disease patients are not able to breathe by themselves. The disease has different rates of treatment and leads to death. Stem cell therapy only slows down the progress of paralysis, but is not able to restore the nerves that have disappeared."
2351,"The hotel is very clean, the rooms have air conditioning (free of charge), daily cleaning, daily clean towels. The offer that I bought was breakfast and dinner, I must admit that we were pleasantly surprised. The meals were very varied in buffet form. The food was very tasty from choice to colour, everyone could eat whatever they wanted and whatever they wanted. The only downside is that hot and cold drinks are only served for breakfast, and for dinner you have to order for a fee. The service of restaurants and bars is very pleasant. The beach by the hotel is unfortunately not very clean, the descent to the sea from the platform to the stairs, the rocky bottom. Sun loungers and umbrellas are free of charge. Next to the mini pier there are also deck chairs and umbrellas. A good solution is to rent a car and go around the island because you can see a lot and have a nice time on the beautiful beaches of Corfu. The neighborhood of the airport is a little bit of a hindrance at the beginning of your stay, but the sight of planes landing at your fingertips rewards everything. Between August 6 and 7, residents of the area have a holiday, there is a party something like our Polish festivals, you can see Greek dances, listen to regional songs sung live and with the cost of roasted ram and other delicious dishes. The family time we have spent without any unpleasant situations. I recommend"
2352,"The neutral ambient temperature for humans is about 21 degrees. In such conditions we can comfortably give away excess heat to the outside without even noticing it. The difference between our internal heat and the ambient temperature is large enough. At 25 - 28 degrees, we feel weakened. We get tired quickly because the body saves energy and does not allow physical effort. It has to put all its energy into what is most important for us - maintaining a constant body temperature. And what happens when we overheat? The professor warned that even a small change in blood temperature, which flows into the brain, can threaten the processes which take place in the so-called hypothalamus. This is where our thermoregulatory centre is located, which is very sensitive to exceeding the optimal point for each organism."
2353,"I have very mixed feelings. Doctor's nice, but 15 minutes is definitely not enough time to get to know the patient and get to know the results. I felt a little too much, and I went out with a great deal of dissatisfaction. I've been treating other doctors for a year and I needed more consultation on how to treat. The doctor prescribed me a medication, not explaining what he has to help me with. When I read the leaflet of these pills, there is no way they fit my condition. I feel like the doctor didn't know how old I was, even though I stressed that I was already menopausal. I won't go to the doctor anymore, because I'm sorry for the money. Actually, it's one of the worst spent money, and I often go to doctors in private. I don't question the doctor's knowledge, but the hurry has made him a good doctor for me. I paid 200 zloty for the visit, I found out that the next one will be expensive too, because I will be weighed down by some special weight. You could have done it on your first visit and made a fuller diagnosis."
2354,"A two-day stay and a total failure! The palace is a lot to say . . . neglected building with renovated front elevation, the rest left as before. The building has 5 hotel rooms! We were lucky enough to sleep in the ""palace"", friends got a room in the Brewery - tragic conditions, a desolate and dirty building. The external environment also leaves much to be desired - buffaloes that are to be the main attraction grazing peacefully in the distance on the pastures and the uppermost named safari is a tractor with a wagon! Tragic gastronomy . The lack of alcoholic beverages from the card, served buffalo steak resembled from the appearance of an inferior piece of beef, and in taste it was far from the steak, hard and rubbery - in a word, a mistake! Tomato as in the old days in kindergarten - those who attended in the 70s - will know what it is all about: ) . Breakfast - a picture of misery and despair - the ""buffet"" consisted of white cheese, yellow cheese, tomato, one type of cold meat and scrambled eggs served in a bowl ( !) There is nothing to do, in the evening around 21 : 00 the waitresses from the café suggested the end of the stay and signalled a desire to close the premises. If it wasn't for the bicycle trip over the lagoon there would be a total massacre. Nothing more . We do not recommend to anyone even for a few hours ."
2355,"The hotel is ideally located for a boat, two minutes from Piotrowska in the very centre, but when it comes to cleanliness it is a tragedy the bathroom is smelly and the bed linen is dirty, for this class of hotel it is unacceptable."
2356,"A nice and competent doctor at first sight. Unfortunately, my child with strong anti-allergic drugs and lime was sent for allergic tests, which I can throw in the trash because the result is not reliable. Very strong medications, including hand attributed steroids, to be administered ""preventively"" twice a day, after the first visit; / I am disappointed. Paying well over 300 zlotys for a visit to the doctor, I expected them to be competent, knowledgeable and helpful. I met with a nice and pleasant visit, which did not help my child in any way. Luckily, I changed em doctor and today my child avoids wreaking havoc with the administration of strong drugs, attributed to the eye. I do not recommend ."
2357,"Actually, the only thing I found out on two visits (over 150zl each) is that it is best to do the tests in the hospital and lie there for a few days. The doctor wasn't even able to offer to take you to the hospital because he doesn't work there. . I didn't know anything at all."
2358,"Spring vegetables, like the first seasonal fruit, will not be able to produce natural sugars, acids and aromatic compounds and are already being transported from abroad. At their destination they are gassed to produce the aging hormone. They are picked when they barely started, now they ripen within 24 hours and present themselves beautifully to buyers. ""Tomatoes from Morocco or Israel are picked in the so-called amber state: only white, bright, orange. They have not yet managed to produce ( . . . ) all the things that determine their taste and smell. When they arrive in their destination country, they undergo rapid ripening, which most often involves gassing with ethyl or carbon dioxide. These gases produce ethylene, the ageing hormone responsible for the ripening of the fruit. Therefore, during the day, vegetables acquire appetizing colors, but not taste, smell and softness. They are also deprived of most nutrients"" - explains dr hab . Ewelina Hallmann from the Department of Functional Food, Ecological and Commodities Science of the Faculty of Human Nutrition and Consumption Sciences at the Warsaw School of Life Sciences."
2359,"Puro hotels create their image towards developed technology, modern style and highly developed service. And it's only a pity that it ends with the creation. On Wednesday morning, 325 km without interruption, expected em that the room may not be ready - this is normal, especially when there are fairs in town and the occupancy rate is high. The lady at the reception desk informed me as he thought em about the unfinished room. I understand, so I just asked em about the parking. Around 2:00 p.m. I got 'em an email from a consultant on the site through which I booked the room that the hotel has overbooking and unfortunately there is no room for me in this hotel, it is in another. I'm at a fair, business meetings are in progress and I'm supposed to be organizing the accommodation. I have also had meetings with customers in the hotel restaurant - everything has to change now! I call it the frivolous treatment of a guest. Around 16, I arrived at the hotel waiting for any explanation. If the receptionist at 10 a.m. didn't know there was overbooking, there is a communication problem. The receptionist at 4 p.m., with whom I had the pleasure of even not saying ""sorry"", just smiled - no comment. Great that the hotel can afford modern technology, tablets and other gadgets, just sorry that the staff could not afford a proper explanation and apology. . . . .for 500 pln per night. I do not recommend ."
2360,"Hotel for one night. The decor and furnishings of the room are a bit reminiscent of the communist times. A small shower cabin . . . generally the room itself as well as the bathroom requiring a bit of renovation and a change in design. . . . .no fridge in the room and mineral water. A small selection of products at breakfast. . . . .relative silence given the nearby trams. . . . . . .the advantage of the hotel is its location. . . . . . . .next to the old town, not far from the tummy spurs. . . . . . .across the street, a shopping mall and public transport stops."
2361,"I definitely do not recommend staying in this hotel. We received a room on the north side with a view of the building and a noisy air conditioner. After the intervention, we received a pseudo 3 unacceptable change proposals. As the northern provinces of Tenerife are more cloudy you can feel like in the basement . As for the service of the cleaning service and the restaurant, it's impeccable. Super service . The average age is mostly 60 to 70 years old (with a few exceptions) . Reception service is unacceptable . The hotel has a great years behind it but is clean in a very neat garden. Due to the reprehensible approach to the customer we advise against."
2362,"I agree with the following opinions that the doctor is gentle, very nice and is a ""great gynaecologist"" if he has to deal with a problem-free case. In my case, the doctor mistook a tumor the size of an orange for an ovary! ! I don't know if it is a matter of bad equipment or if it is a matter of the fact that she should already think about her pension and thus save the fear and suffering of other patients that I had to go through."
2363,"When I came to your hotel, I was hoping for luxury and rest and the whole trip had to be nervous and ashamed. Lack of comfort in the room, broken dryer, spa to 21 . 00 , lie in the offer . . . . . .I was disappointed! on the first day I was supposed to have dinner I wrote that I will be at 23 . 00 was 'em at 21. At 11 p.m. I had to pay for the dinners and nobody informed me about it ! even though I talked to the man at the reception desk, after a long journey instead of eating good food, I had to listen to the waitress broadcasting how the restaurant is badly managed, bad programme, bad new manager etc. ."
2364,"We are very pleased with our stay here. The property is in a beautiful area and was pretty inside. The pool / spa is wonderful and impeccably clean. The breakfast was amazing, with a huge selection of good quality fresh ingredients. The staff were helpful. They had a free bicycle rental and we are very happy to cycle around the lake. However, on bikes we both had a fault, which was frustrating, so he would have told m that they had to replace or better quality bikes - he would have been happy even if they were better! Still, just a small minus for the rest of it is perfect."
2365,"""This is a natural and rational way to dose UV radiation. We can, of course, use sunscreens, which are extremely useful especially in situations where we have to be exposed to the sun for a longer period of time, or we cannot cover ourselves rationally with clothing which is also an excellent filter and perfectly protects us from the adverse effects of the sun"" - adds prof . Woźniacka . Protective filters are only one aspect of photoprotection. One should also remember about appropriate headgear - wide roundabout hats, baseball caps, or shirts, airy but with long sleeves. ""Of course, we can naturally avoid the sun between 11 and 15 or 16 hours, i.e. during the largest exposure"" - added the dermatologist ."
2366,"The doctor seemed to be the nicest child doctor she knew, as long as she was going to see me in private, when the next visit was supposed to be in 3 months' time, she thought I would save up and signed up for the DSK. She saved me money but not nerves. The doctor was rude, the child (3 years old) screamed that he was hanging around on a stool, adding that it wouldn't spoil his bad day anyway (!), he also paid attention to me, he didn't listen to my suggestions, she left me as disappointed as never before. . . . ."
2367,"and I advise against staying in this hotel - tempted by the professional website and the hotel's membership of the Anders Group, I had the dubious pleasure of being a guest of this place. The hotel rooms are in terrible condition for the declared 3 *, dirty walls and carpets, equipment from 20 years ago, bed linen with holes, washed towels or bathrobes - when asked why it is so, the staff answers that the hotel is for sale and nobody invests in it. It is difficult to write anything positive, because even a large swimming pool or other equipment in the spa area is not the first one to be young and needs renovation. Maybe it is better to close such a place or change it into a hostel than to keep such a facility that affects the image of the whole Group. I enclose a picture of the towel I had in my room - no!"
2368,"I strongly advise against it! I reported to my doctor with chronic fatigue and headaches for six months, which make my life quite difficult and exclude me from any social life. I have been very much affected by this and my mental health. After a minute of conversation with the doctor, she only managed to tell me that I suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome and accept hormonal contraception. She was shocked that the doctor immediately made a diagnosis ""it's the pills' fault"". She asked me if maybe she wanted to see my blood test results, head CT, MRI. . . . .nothing was important because - and I quote - ""what to diagnose here, if the reason is simple"" . The doctor was annoying me with her condescending tone, refuting all the methods of treatment of previous doctors (and because of my health, she visited a lot of them within 7 years). For two months now, the doctors have been trying to find out what is wrong with me by doing detailed examinations, and finally the neurologist suggested a visit to an endocrinologist. . . . .and the doctor barely asked me to examine my thyroid hormones. . . She repeated twice that I'm not the doctor here and she didn't even want to give a referral for a glucose test (and as it turns out, I have insulin resistance). During the gynaecological examination she asked why I take hormonal contraception when I have PCO and it will be difficult for me to get pregnant (the last thing she wanted me to hear, because she wanted me to have a baby). I consider such an approach to a confused patient to be shameful, because after commissioning tests from an internist it turned out that I have a huge shortage of vitamins. D deficiency and it is possible that he is the cause - now I supplement it and I feel much better. I have the impression that the doctor is against the use of hormonal contraception because the explanations that this allows me to regulate the cycle, hirsutism and skin problems, and at the same time to play the role of a contraception. I think that such views should be clearly communicated to the patient before the visit, and not to tell him that all his life other doctors were wrong and did harm to the patient!"
2369,"Ideal location if someone came to Szklarska to come to the mountains. The hotel is located right next to the entrance to the main trail, which leads along the ridge of the Giant Mountains. Homemade food, very delicious breakfast, great, helpful and professional service. The rooms are clean and tidy, towels and bed linen are changed upon request. We highly recommend the hotel Little Bavaria!"
2370,"He's visited dozens of hotels but hasn't met em yet. The antique decor ( a matter of taste ) . The bathroom shocked me the most. There were 6 tiles missing in the bathroom floor - the lack of them was compensated by concrete in which there was a big hole. The washbasin was dirty and cracked. The smell of moisture and musty smell was in the bathroom. The toilet was movable, be careful not to damage it even more. Hotel towels looked like torn rags with which the fear was wiping. In the room two large windows overlooking the busy road in one of them there were no blinds, with the light on everything was visible. The bed mattress wore disgusting blotches (I don't want to think what it could have been). Surprised, my wife and I were having breakfast. Generally in hotels they are in the Swedish table, but not in the Titanic. Breakfast is served by the ladies, probably from a frugal way - very modest and poor. No drinks, no fruit, no buns. Small portions. I think that the price for such an overnight stay is very exorbitant - I do not recommend. The worst hotel there was em in."
2371,"Don't be fooled by the pictures on the website (especially the Swedish table) because there was nothing special for breakfast and if someone came later it was no longer scrambled eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc even though breakfast time was from 9. 00 to 11 . 00 . Another thing is hot water - if you get up too late or in the evening after a mountain hike, you can hardly get a summer shower. Cleanliness also leaves a lot to be desired and these jars with old mortars. . . . . . . . . . Don't count on TV channels either! The best impression is left by Mr. Parkingman, a nice man."
2372,"There is such a business worth almost PLN 3 billion a year, which operates in Poland in six, not consecutive months. This business is a wedding reception. The fact that they are organized in waves, because most of all: in March, June, August, September, October and December, results from ... superstition. According to him, getting married in a month that has the letter ""r"" in its name guarantees happiness to the newlyweds. Although this is not indicated by statistical analysis, because the percentage of divorces is increasing and the number of months without the letter ""r"" does not, but superstition , it is superstition and most weddings and therefore wedding receptions accumulate over six months . What does not change the fact that for accommodation facilities it is a good and - despite the smaller number of weddings - growing market segment."
2373,"I am treated at Dr Ziętkowiak's in my clinic in Kalisz. I am satisfied, for a long time I struggled with various infections until I found myself in the doctor's office. For 2 years it has been all right, now I am in the 4th month of pregnancy, also he is watching over me and my baby. For now it's all right and let's keep it that way :) . I greet the Doctor: )"
2374,"In my opinion, Mrs. Julia Otto is a top-notch specialist who was the first to help me find and love myself. Her delicacy, warmth, and determination make our therapy sessions a safe journey into the inner world of my deepest experiences, needs and desires, which I had no idea existed. I especially recommend meetings with Ms. Julia to those who have been afraid to expose themselves to another person, because in her office they are not waiting for a strict evaluation, but on the contrary, learning to love and respect each other, regardless of the baggage of experiences and personal history. When I think about what I owe to Mrs. Julia, I am reminded of the words ""Letter to a young poet"". by R . M . Rilke: ""We have no reason to be distrustful of our world, because it does not turn against us. If there are fears in it, they are our fears. If there is an abyss in it, then the abyss belongs to us. (...) Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are just waiting to see our beauty and boldness. Perhaps everything that is terrible is deeply defenseless and expects our help""."
2375,"In my opinion Mrs. Monika is a very good and effective psychologist, committed, wise, warm, individual approach to the patient, very empathic and patient. She can really listen, she doesn't feel like being judged, and she feels a lot of understanding, and this is the basis of good therapy in my opinion. Your psychologist is able to establish an understanding with the patient. In my case, she has very aptly chosen the direction of therapy, offered effective ways to improve my mental situation, helped me improve my mood. Of course, nothing happens without the participation of the patient and you have to get involved in the therapy yourself, but the big advantage of Mrs. Monika is that she can ask the right questions so skillfully that she makes you think, helps you to look at your own problems and look at your feelings from different sides, which helped me a lot. A very cordial person. I wholeheartedly recommend!"
2376,"I got to her because I couldn't get pregnant. She got m referred to a lot of tests and it turned out that I have hashimoto . She said I generally have such bad test results that I won't get pregnant for long. . . . . .after 2 weeks, she was pregnant. . . .of course, I was taking care of her because she thought she was a miracle worker. . . To be honest, she didn't examine me even once, she was still finding some problems that I was afraid of, such as potential child underdevelopment, dwarfism, diabetes. . She even forced me to go on sick leave arguing that if the baby died it wouldn't be her fault, every fatigue (normal pregnancy) she took for loss of consciousness and had me do an ultrasound to see if she was moving with the young. She kept on reducing my thyroxine doses even though my hormone requirement is still growing, tsh never dropped below 2. Generally it was a very stressful pregnancy although completely normal and not at risk. The baby is healthy and that is the most important! Private phones are standard, comments about outgoing / waiting patients also. but the doctor changed me I go to a very reasonable Dr. Makowska, who regulated my hormone dose in such a way that I have model results."
2377,"I don't recommend it. During his visit, he answered the phone twice before playing with it on his desk. Discussing the purpose of the examination and treatment without eye contact with the patient . Examination of the neck muscles probably done correctly but very quickly . I did not receive any statements or conclusions. Nothing. If it wasn't for my questions, the doctor wouldn't have informed me about the conclusions of the examination. Embarrassing way of treating the patient and getting money from him for additional examinations. The doctor did not inspire my trust, nor did the clinic. The nice ladies at the reception is not everything. I judge the doctor's empathy at - 10 . Maybe he's been doing it too long. I could see the boredom of the subject of the examination. The visit lasted maybe 10 - 12 minutes, which is funny as the distance I had to cover to get to Katowice."
2378,"Hotel on the outskirts of the city connected to the water complex and surrounded by football fields. The hotel has few guests and quietly, the silence can only be disturbed by fans or parties taking place downstairs in the hall. The hotel has a one hour pass to the swimming pool, which is worth using, in the water complex there is a large swimming pool with several lanes, jacuzzi, slides, sauna so it is really worth going there given that in the immediate vicinity we have only pitches and blocks of flats. The rooms are clean and well decorated, breakfasts like this and probably the weakest of all the ibis in which it was m although the other day was already improving because there was a coffee machine and there was mustard and ketchup for sausages. But to sum up, all the place has potential football infrastructure is worse with results in the games."
2379,"He booked 'em a hotel by booking being on the road knowing that it's all stuck to this hotel at night making up for 20km from the highway by motorcycle. . He got 'em at 23; 30 and found out that it was all closed. Nothing helped the doorbell and the phone number indicated on the website. Nothing worse than a frozen guest hoping for a warm bath in front of a closed and inhospitable hotel. After 20 minutes, the neighbors at the hotel came out and were also surprised that no one opened the door. The neighborhood of another hotel, the ""Sporthotel Wilder Kaiser"", which had a 24-hour reception, was super hospitable and I highly recommend to everyone. It is not worth the risk of booking a hotel that can be closed!"
2380,"I see a lot of positive opinions about the Doctor here. I happen to need a consultation with a dermatologist. I know that she may be writing on the wrong page, but can any of you speaking here give me information such as: what is the cost of the visit, how long it takes and whether the Doctor will take care of my problem, i.e. a strange allergic reaction of the neck skin, which is manifested by very dry and reddish skin. I would like to ask for an answer and greet you very warmly."
2381,"During the visit to Lux - medzas, the doctor paid attention to the child's enlarged almond. She explained that the asymmetry of almonds has been present for years, she has been seen by several doctors and the child does not complain about the throat. The doctor stated that the child is sick with RADIATION ( ! ), the change should be cut out and gives us a referral to the hospital. At the same time with a spatula she tried to ""squeeze"" something out of the child's tonsil, which caused pain and discomfort. She refused to take the referral to the hospital and quickly enrolled the child for a consultation with the Medicus. There, the throat was thoroughly examined with an endoscope. There was no radiant tube, a simple almond hypertrophy was found, absolutely not for surgery! I absolutely do not recommend this doctor, she is making the diagnosis ""out of her sleeve"". The disease is a very rare disease, which exposes the parent and the child to unnecessary stress, and without any tests!"

2386,"We had a wedding in summer 2014. Unfortunately, we have terrible memories of the planning phase. The hotel made a mistake and suddenly our rooms were booked by the couple organizing the wedding in the second room. The reaction - the washing out, making a statement that it was our fault because the reservation was not included in the contract and there were no phone calls. After some time, the insolence of the staff stopped even surprising us. Another version and other decisions made every 5 minutes. Mr. Manager pretending to be helpless . Stress caused by the fact that someone lost room reservations fell on us . We have been suggested many times that it was our fault. The room one year after the reservation was in worse condition. Numerous dirt on the walls, curtains so dirty that the hand is black after touching it several times. We wanted to replace them with our own curtains for aesthetic reasons, but we had to hang them on top of each other because the hotel would have crumpled - maybe that is why they were never washed? ! The manager avoided us like a fire and did not show up at the hotel when they announced our arrival. The staff answers every question - it has to be agreed with the manager. As a young couple we got a room with a broken shower and we were washed with water bouncing off the wall. We have no allergies, but there was so much dust in the room that the wedding night was a constant sneeze. We didn't have the strength to ask for another room in the morning because I can imagine the reactions of the staff. The most violent room for the bride and groom. . . After the wedding, nobody even said goodbye. We packed everything ourselves - decorations, flowers. No one even asked if there was anything to help. At the breakfast, my guests had to sit down while eating because suddenly it turned out that there are some reservations on the tables despite the lack of any information. We were so disgusted with the quality of service. . . . .none of our marrying friends had to worry about things like us both before and after the wedding. At the end of the wedding, I still got a coffee bill that the guests who didn't drink soluble coffee asked for. Some bayonet money for a teaspoonful of ground coffee poured with boiling water. They paid us a bill for the wedding and accommodation, and the lady first prepared the coffee and then informed me that I have something else to pay. It's a shame. . . . .unfortunately we have such memories thanks to the service of the Borowina Hotel"
2387,"What can be helpful for hearing, which together with the voice is a working tool? The questions were answered by an expert from the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing Maciej Ludwikowski during the XII Science Festival in Jablonna . As Maciej Ludwikowski observes, the term ""good hearing"" is often mistaken for ""musical hearing"". . . .the so-called . . . absolute . Persons with absolute musical hearing have an excellent frequency resolution of sound . They can distinguish between 1000 Hz and 950 Hz. They are the so-called ""bookkeepers"" among musicians, who are able to pick out any unspoken note from a song. At the same time, they may have a lowered threshold of hearing, because one with the other is not excluded. Often musicians suffer from hearing loss, especially after many years of performing, exposure to unilateral noise. According to an expert you can defend yourself against it."
2388,Dr. Hus is a very good specialist who can be entrusted with his health without hesitation. I had the opportunity to observe the effects of this doctor who put my seriously ill father on his feet. I am very grateful to the doctor and I recommend him with full responsibility to any interested patient.
2389,"We spent one night here on our way back from Montenegro. The hotel is located a little outside the strict center but easy to locate well-marked access. The rooms are clean, modern and spacious. Good location for running and physical activity. WiFi OK . Breakfast served to the table OK, maybe for 4 stars a bit modest but tasty. I recommend to stop for 100%. Competitive price : )"
2390,"He spent two weeks in ""Sniezka"" as part of a holiday settlement offer. The resort is very extensive and multi-level, which means that it is located on a very long (about 600 - 800 m from the reception desk to the farthest apartments) and quite narrow plot of varying gradients. The apartments are very large, elegant and very well equipped (as described on the website). The ground floor apartments are mostly located in such a way that you can look into them through the window passing by the sidewalk, so I strongly recommend those located on the first floor and because of the comfort of moving around the object I recommend those not included in the settlement program (sealed with pets for children). The food is very tasty and varied, the problem is quite small amount of space in Sniezka restaurant. The swimming pools are clean, small and without slides for bigger children. Animations within the settlement framework addressed mainly to younger children . The facilities in the form of family center and playground are very small and in the season far too tight. If you are going to exercise in a fit center, I would like to warn you that it is microscopic and very poorly equipped, but I think it is a plus. The fact that in the settlement you can buy tickets to some of the nearby attractions of the region (e.g. Julia steelworks) at very attractive prices deserves a big plus. During the season, there is also a slight problem with parking cars (lack of a sufficient number of parking spaces under the apartments). In general, I recommend the resort for families with children who like to spend time actively and not necessarily on the premises of the resort, because its location is a base for trips in the area. To the shop and gas station about 500 m ."
2391,"fatal service, stinks in rooms, water problems. Motto of the hotel: milk as much as possible from the customer. I do not recommend it. The lady at the reception desk acts as if she was there for the punishment and is the queen of the world. just embarrassing behavior. not the way you treat someone who leaves money there."
2392,"I stayed at the hotel several times, every time - less cleaned bathroom, plus the noise from the room next door (the noise is normal conversation, there is bad isolation in the hotel), you can hear. After 2 or 3 stays I was forced to leave the hotel for nearby Ibis about 20 times - I could hear every word from the next room. I was not reimbursed for the hotel day, no one answered my e-mail about it."
2394,"I recommend the Scaliano Spa with all responsibility. Professional and friendly service, high standard of the hotel, great views. I encourage you to enjoy a romantic evening in the Jacuzzi with champagne, fruit and candles. The rooms are very clean, nicely decorated. The food is very good. Close to the cure park. We spent a very nice time here."
2395,"A FANTASTIC HOTEL. We were at the hotel between 21 and 28 July 2018. The hotel certainly deserves 6 plus. At the reception desk multilingual service, on the big plus that there are two Polish ladies : ) The rooms we got renovated, in beautiful colors: white, turquoise and gray. They are cleaned daily. The animators take care of the children and the adults will find something for themselves, such as a zumba in the pool: ) I recommend : ) Every evening something different, e.g. flamenco evening, brodway show etc. In my opinion, the greatest distinction deserves the chef and his crew - both cooks and waiters alike. The food is simply delicious and varied (every day something different, e.g. evening with pizza, evening with fish, various meats). Every day a large selection of sweets and fruit - children are delighted. The hotel is sensationally located in the center of the village and also close to the beach. There is a queue going directly to Barcelona or Blanes etc. Hopefully I'll be here someday : ) I can recommend this hotel to anyone."
2396,"New apartments in an uninteresting area, advertised with a swimming pool on site with the fact that the swimming pool is in one of the 4 buildings in which the apartments are located, in the swimming pool cold and not too clean water. We went in the autumn and the apartment is cool. Too high price in relation to quality. Apartments neat but raw, kitchen well equipped."
2397,"After a long walk in the mountains, we went for dinner to the White Raven. The place is ideally located to have a large number of hungry guests, coming down from the mountains or going down the gondola train. The climate is nice, although the idyllic highlander decor should be cleaned from time to time from the omnipresent dust. . . We have been waiting for the card for a while. . . It is interestingly written, although the catchy names of the dishes do not explain what is inside. For example, under the name of a meat pan there is a greasy sausage 1 piece. and grilled black pudding 1 piece. In addition to this there is a handful of frozen vegetables, a piece of bread roll, one hot potato in uniform divided in half and a non-eatable garlic sauce. Price. . . attention: 29 zł ! ! ! ! For four people, two have already eaten before the next two are served dinner. . . the famous sausage and a portion of old Russian dumplings, heated up in hot oil, from which, when cut, it came out. . . . . . . . Brrrrrrrr. . . . . . Drama. The charm was complemented by the Manager / Owner, who was taking advantage of the waitress who could not cope with the terminal - by the guests! Massacre, never again. It's better to approach Karpacz, where in the net, your smiling ladies will bake a piece of real meat. At half price . Plus for Żurek in oven-baked bread . In the card stands that with egg and sausage . There were only pieces of sausage . Eggs nobody saw but a good snorkel. Please avoid the White Jar with the ""Johnny delicacies"" wide arch!"
2398,"Beautifully located on the peninsula, around the lake. Modernly furnished, but . . . . .in the room I found only two clothes hangers. She got more only when she asked me at the reception. In the room you can very much hear conversations in the corridor, the children running around. The food offer is quite poor for a five-star hotel. The next (different) dishes were delivered gradually, even though the opening hours of the dining room already lasted. Dinner is only from 18 months, only a few dishes, only water is included in the price, other drinks are additionally paid. This is a hotel that reserves an exclusive wooden platform with sun loungers for the guests of the apartments, the rest of them have to use the usual loungers on the sandy beach. I have never encountered such segregation before. The service in this hotel is ""strange"". No smile, even a little ""welcome again"". The reception desk works without eye contact with the guest. When she asked me about something, she heard m "" I don't know, I'm 1 - szy day at work "" . That's what happens, but I don't need to know that, I don't need to have a problem through it. I'm not interested in it. She had a hard time booking. She was at that hotel twice, each time she had to contact me a couple of times because either no reservation was sent, or she was miscalculated. In this hotel there is an atmosphere of ""leave your money with us""."
2399,"As the head of the scientific team, Dr Henryk Jaremek, explained to PAP, the invention is based on the detection of temperature changes in tissue. In combination with other methods, it enables the diagnosis of patients regardless of age, structure and temperature of breasts. Therefore, contact thermography can improve screening tests. The effectiveness and usefulness of the device BRASTER Tester in the process of diagnosing the pathology of breast glands was proved by a clinical trial completed in February. ""The liquid crystalline state of the matter was already observed in the late nineteenth century. However, it was only in the 1960s that the interest in liquid crystals increased significantly - especially when the colour change properties of the thin layer of liquid crystal and their other no less interesting properties were discovered. The first LCD screens were developed as early as 1968 . For many years, liquid crystals have been the subject of interest and research work in aspects of their applications in medicine"" - explains Dr. Jaremek , Vice-President of BRASTER S . A ."
2400,"The manufacturer does not give a disc in the set, and this one is untypical (centring hole 20mm) - available only from Makita for about 200 PLN. per piece ! ! ! An alternative is a Dewalt disc for 50 PLN . per piece which fits, except that the disc is thicker and simple cutting with the use of the edge of the foot is impossible, only by hand - to the eye - it is inconvenient. Lack of availability of discs at an acceptable price makes the purchase of the device uneconomic. A small disc with a diameter of 110 mm is really enough for very little. Despite the obvious drawbacks, the device is made really solidly and using the original Makita blade it cuts perfectly."
2401,"advantages : + quite clean + nice person in service in the kitchen minuses : - the owner moves from room to room - our things in our absence without knowledge and consent ( ! ) - potatoes, fried pasta, rice and groats for breakfast, with several Georgian dishes such as beets, fried eggplant, cucumber and tomato salad; often the same for dinner - wi - fi barely worksWe chose this place tempted by opinions in travel portals, where various people write about the friendly atmosphere, Georgian hospitality and tasty food. Unfortunately. The problems started after the arrival, because it turned out that they do not have the rooms ordered by us. We were located in temporary rooms of low standard (for one night and we were supposed to spend four nights there), they said we would wait. The next day, indeed, the lady from the service led us to a better room (corresponding to the price we paid), where we left our things and went out into the mountains, unaware of how unpleasant a surprise awaits us when we return. The same person from the staff told us that he still had to clean the room, so we left our key to him. Tired of going out all day, we come back and ask for our key. There is no key. The Russian-Polish conversation has a finale in another room, with poor standard. It turns out that, however, our room has been booked and therefore SEND OUR Things without our knowledge, not to mention consent. Since then, Nino avoided us even with her eyesight and the staff stopped understanding. Especially during meals, which, praised many times in the forums, consisted of setting the tables with fried pasta, potatoes and rice. Between them sometimes you could pick up something Georgian, but the taste of these dishes was canteen style, not homemade. It has become a low class guesthouse, so if you want to get to know the culture, taste traditional cuisine and experience Georgian hospitality - choose to stay away from home. Nam Nino successfully spoiled the trip."
2402,"The doctor is a competent and concrete person. She already knew how to heal my skin lesions. She did not limit herself to the ointment itself but she also prescribed me an oral medication, after which the cause of the problem can be removed. And that's the point. As for the effectiveness of the treatment, there is still time for a final evaluation. I generally recommend to other patients Dr. Czubak ."
2403,"I have used the children's holidays offer for children - unfortunately, as for me, despite the incredible potential, this center treats it very unprofessionally. For a price comparable to 4 * * * * hotels, you get 1. Small rooms, no fridge, kettle 2. Eating really tragic - breakfast a small choice, basically only scrambled eggs + frankfurters, lunches very weak, no desserts, fruits. And also during the Children's Holidays - food for children massacre. . . risotto with mushrooms, all mega-spiced, generally you can see that the chef has no idea about feeding the kids 3 . Attractions in the area - all closed, the zoo, the sealarium, despite the fact that they opened for various groups, it was not possible to join, and unfortunately we came Monday - Saturday, so we did not catch on to these attractions. Even the ponies, which were supposed to be all week long, had a card and the door ""unauthorized access is forbidden"". . . 4 . Animations for children - two days poorly, another three came another animator and much better, but the playroom itself strongly mediocre 5 . Fruit breakfast for children - unfortunately sometimes the staff forgot to bring it out, only after a reminder appeared on the plus side - bar staff, mega friendly and professional, nice big pool, beautiful surroundings. It is a pity that the really powerful potential is completely untapped."
2404,"Every year it is visited by thousands of Guests who, choosing the Qubus Hotel chain, expect the highest quality of services. Therefore the facility regularly invests in increasing comfort in rooms and other hotel rooms. ""The hotel has been undergoing renovation works for about two months. When planning the changes, we were guided by the idea of providing our Guests with even greater sense of comfort. While changing the appearance of the bathrooms, we wanted to completely change these rooms. All the more so because the bathroom is one of the most important elements that hotel guests pay attention to. says Anetta Hanczyn - Rak, director of Qubus Hotel Złotoryja. The new interiors are kept in a light, beige tone and their colouring harmonises with the rest of the hotel rooms. We also managed to bring out the desired ergonomics and comfortable space. The new look has also gained a large, sunny terrace belonging to the hotel."
2405,"We came back from vacation in this hotel yesterday and could not wait for me to write a review. It is worth noting the location of the hotel - almost on the beach (just cross the street), very close to the center of the town and the train, which in just over an hour you can get to Barcelona (along the coast). The rooms are neatly furnished, cleaned daily and towels are changed. The hotel staff, both at the reception and the cleaning ladies are always nice, helpful and smiling. In the hotel's pool bar there are attractions for everyone every day - for children mini disco with animator, in the evenings concerts, bingo, dance shows etc. The bartenders and barmaids are polite, drinks - coffee and drinks are great! Food deserves the highest rating - we used the FB option. The dishes are varied, everyone will find something for themselves and most importantly delicious! There are also Spanish dishes like seafood and dishes from around the world. Worthy of many good restaurants. The restaurant service is amazing - full of smile and help. I sincerely recommend to everyone !"
2406,"A great doctor and a man, you could always call, get advice, warm and cordial even did not thank the doctor for his support in Dad's disease. The whole clinic on Pasteur Street is a great people even though Daddy left, and we knew that they were there to rescue us to the end and with heart. Thank you Szymańscy from Jelenia Góra."
2407,"Overnight stay on the occasion of the wedding in the part called "" Little Finland "" The cottages are located on a small pond with two double rooms with one bathroom. Good for families and people who know each other, because the door closes only to the cottage, but not to the rooms. Compact bathroom - like in Ibis. The rooms are covered in wood, a big plus are the nets in the insect windows and the smell for contact deterring mosquitoes. A big minus is the general acoustics of the object - you can hear everything from the outside and from the other room, even when someone is talking quietly. I recommend taking earplugs."
2408,"I bought 'em two Manta navigations, for myself and a friend. I was tempted by the low price and the fact that you can install AutoMapa . The purchase was made on 11 February 2017 and during those few months I can say with a clear conscience that it was the worst purchase in my life. Navigation often freezes (the map is frozen), it is hard to start it, often even a hard reset does not help. You have to connect it under the home charger and it will graciously start. If it loses the signal it catches it very long and sometimes only hard reset helps. The messages pop up on the screen and when you press ok the navigation resets itself. Using it is so tiring to me that I have had enough of it. Two Polish companies, i.e. Manta and AutoMapa, can't get along to make it work well, I am extremely disappointed. I believe that Manta abuses the information in its description, and I quote. However, there is nothing to prevent the user from installing another car navigation application on their own, such as MapaMap or Auto Mapa, which says that their device is compatible with AutoMapa, no, it does not, and it is the same with the other navigation system. This matter is suitable for the Consumer Ombudsman."
2409,"Informant 1 lecture Avoidance The above mentioned opinion is not 100% correct with this gentleman. Otoz, Dr. Chaos (such a nickname has been given in the middle of my yearbook) absolutely does not know how to pass on knowledge. The classes consist in randomly jumping off the subject and throwing concepts that someone who has not had contact with the world of programming will not understand (and someone who has, will have a meth in his head from a lack of information). He's even worse off: the lecture ends with a test that is impossible to be solved entirely by a normal mortal practitioner. Just 25 minutes of time for probably the same number of questions (or more, I don't remember anymore), constructed on the basis of the principle ""The death penalty is not a problem."
2410,"Hello, kindly, gentle. You can see that she listens and shows interest, scrupulously notes. However, she misjudged the age of my pregnancy and misinterpreted the blood results. I suspect that in my case, in any case pregnancy would not save anything, so I have no pretensions. This is confirmed by the fact that sometimes it is better to go to several doctors and no courtesy counts. Greetings."
2411,"New hotel, very cool (rooms from the lake side!), great swimming pool, saunas, location, area around the hotel etc. Restaurant - prepare yourselves for a disaster. If you still have a buffet as a taco are overwhelmed, so a few busy tables at lunch time causes total stillness (30 minutes of waiting for a glass of wine!!!) and chaos (the waiters get only selected tables, the dishes to the tables are brought so that one person completes the whole meal and the other person e.g. still waiting for 20 minutes for the first course, the staff without order and the composition runs the room). If you don't want to spoil your mood and lose an hour and a half for a simple lunch it's better to jump on the adjacent campsite for fries: ) Oh, so it doesn't have to be - the food is very tasty."
2412,"The first attempts to make a blood substitute in the world were made many years ago. However, until now, synthetic blood is not available. ""The most common cause of failure was the toxicity of the carrier itself, or that it carried oxygen too poorly. Blood is a very strong oxidant - it destroys tissue. It is quite difficult to keep it in check, i.e. keep the balance so that it carries oxygen but does not destroy tissues. An example is a stroke of blood to the brain. Blood that comes into direct contact with tissues simply burns them"" - describes Dr. Ciach. ""The only cells adapted to constant contact with blood are the endothelial cells lining our circulatory system from within,"" he explains. The technology was developed at the Faculty of Chemical Engineering of the Warsaw University of Technology and was licensed to NanoSanguis. Start - up was included in the investment portfolio of the StartVenture @ Poland fund, which was created in cooperation with the National Centre for Research and Development."
2413,"I have been to almost every hotel in the chain (except Bialystok), I am a gold card holder. So far I have been satisfied. Now, unfortunately. . . My accusations are not so much about the hotel itself as about the guests. The hotel is a combination. The noise, you're making a mess, the canteen and not the restaurant. The reception is rather moderately nice. You're just another of a thousand. . . The tropical years of greatness are behind us. The beds have been packed with towels since the pool opened. . . Five people in the pool. . . This should be FORBIDDEN! Rescuers should pay attention to this sick phenomenon . This is a family hotel, so looking for rest and silence is not here! I didn't feel like a guest here anymore. Just like that. Next time I'll try to compete - Hotel Mikołajki . One good thing - food . A large selection, but the conditions during the meal tragic. Sometimes there are missing tables and people with loaded plates in their hands stand and wait . No, not for me anymore. . ."
2414,"Hostel in the renovation so general mess. Full of dust and unmerciful noise . The workers are hanging around everywhere, so generally even under the windows they are not missing. Hostel staff, or rather the owner . . . . . . .to put it mildly, he has something to do with his head. . The insolence and hostility towards guests is a delicate expression of how they are treated. Never take a school trip there because there is no question of keeping children safe. The children get rooms far away from the teachers, they sleep on marital beds and the owner cannot understand why the teachers make a problem with the accommodation: ) a shock! CONCLUSIONING . . . . . . .AVOID THE WIDE CURVE !"
2415,"Hotel nicely located on a hill overlooking the city . This applies to rooms from the back of the building. On the other side there is a view of the parking lot or park. The hotel's best years are over. Especially outside the building you can see a lot of gaps. Rooms in different standards. The cheapest completely satisfactory . Bathroom without any problems . Well, that's one night's accommodation. Quiet neighborhood so you can get a good night's sleep. Very close to the castle and the center also not far away. The staff is nice and trouble-free."
2416,"The Doctor seems to be unpleasant. There is no possibility of full speech, because she interrupts all the time. At times you may get the impression that she has a disrespectful attitude towards the patient. She did not give exhaustive information about the patient. She has ordered the tests, not informing what they should prove. Maybe the doctor had a worse day. During the visit she felt uncomfortable as if she was there from the duress. She simply lacked interest on her part. I won't be back for another visit."
2417,"Thanks to the portal, a well-known doctor came to ProFizjo's office. Very good opinions encouraged me to make an appointment for consultations and I was not disappointed. Mr. Grzegorz listened to me, looked at the results of my research and gave clear and comprehensive information about the condition of my spine. It is now 2 months since she started to exercise under his watchful eye and I see a huge improvement. Mr. Grzegorz , is a wonderful physiotherapist with great knowledge and experience. His smile and sense of humour are very helpful in overcoming his own weaknesses while exercising. Now I am sure that my spine is in good hands. I highly recommend! Iza. K"
2418,"As for me most of the things on yes, but the quality of workmanship as for me is a failure 2 times in the service. Once the handset stopped playing after 2 days, the second time the baton was unstuck. If somebody will watch out for it I recommend it but if somebody wants to use it on a bike etc. I don't recommend it. A very big disadvantage is the quality of the headband that broke and 3 trips to the service are getting ready. At first they are not very comfortable and then it gets better (it is best to hang them on something similar in width to the head because the first two days are not surviveable."
2419,"I'm sorry, but I was disappointed in that doctor. She heard a lot of good things from her friends before. When my daughter was born, in despair that she was so early that she was seriously ill that she could die - the light of hope shone - she goes to Opole, to Dr. Walas. And our first impressions were positive. Such a nice, committed doctor. Such a nice team. Then the first rasps appeared. And that's what my mother thought, that she leaned against the incubator. And that's what the nurse did to the parents. And this in an unpleasant way he ""interrogated"" on his morning visit a deadly tired doctor handing over the duty. We thought that eminent people sometimes have difficult characters. But then his nervous actions became dangerous for patients. I think it was just a tired day, but the doctor didn't record the problems reported by the nurses, he asked for the same thing several times. The next day after the operation on the chest, the little one had the painkillers stopped and the doctor leading the daughter explained that the accelerated heart rate is a symptom of anaemia and not pain, and the grimace on the face of the premature baby is not suffering, but stupidity. Finally, he lost patience to us and despite previous arrangements, the child requiring a respirator periodically (without informing us) was transferred to another hospital. . ."
2420,"The advantage of this hotel is its location. It is located in the city centre, right across the street from the Old Brewery. The Old Market Square can be reached in 10 minutes by walk. I remember the hotel itself from the communist times, now it has changed for the better. You can see the interior and rooms have been renovated. It's a pity that the parking lot next to the main entrance was closed down. Now that the hotel's underground car park is full, you can park right next door in a private car park (4 PLN/hr - September 2015). The beds are comfortable, the room is quiet, you can't hear the noise from outside. Breakfast is standard, but tasty and the choice is large. In the same room where breakfast is served, there is a bar ( ? ) . There is a casino in the hotel, but I won't write anything about it because I didn't use 'em."
2421,"- In Poland, too little is said about what sepsis is, what are the treatment options, how to take care of a patient after sepsis. Therefore, together with the Association for Sepsis Research and Treatment ""Beat Sepsis"" we decided to launch a platform which will be a compendium of knowledge on this subject - says project coordinator Adrian Szulczyński . The PokonacSepse.pl portal contains information on the diagnosis of symptoms, prevention and the latest guidelines for the treatment of this disease. The materials available on the platform have been developed by experts in various fields, including microbiology, cardiology, surgery, nephrology and paediatrics, as well as specialists in intensive care and primary care physicians."
2422,"A hotel just in time for a one-hour stay. The room is clean and tidy. Very compact - the bathroom is tiny, ""plastic"" but clean. There is a small wardrobe, a small table - ideal for up to 2 people who want to spend time sightseeing in Warsaw and need an inexpensive accommodation near the center. Very good location for public transport - trams and buses to the center, near the Central Station, bus No. 175 on one side straight to the Old Town, the other to the airport (stop next to Hotel Sobieski 5 minutes walk). Very nice and helpful young man at the reception. He gives a grade of 4 taking into account the location of the hotel and cleanliness of the room. However, if someone is expecting a large room, a refrigerator, a full bar, etc. then this is not a hotel for this person - at least not at the lowest price per day."
2423,"Very industrial hotel. It seems all right - a large room (separately a place to sleep, but TV at the ceiling), a place to make tea (all stuffed in a small can), a kitchenette, but no fridges, a nice bathroom (but apart from a large soap and shampoo tray, no additional accessories). Everything seems to fit together, but the lack of climate - and Krakow is particularly acute. The room was not cozy, the bed was moderately comfortable, the pillows were heavily worn. At breakfast, right in front of my table, the staff threw the leftovers from the plates into the basket, which was open at all times. Then one of the men went to put the bread in the baskets - without a glove. The staff was nice, the hotel was clean, but not my climate, not my style. Since the * * * * * expects more."
2424,"Scientists are also interested in how different genetic variants control the expression of genes, because it in turn regulates more complex traits, such as those that are important for health. This approach has been used for example in research on genetic control of the size of the hippocampus, i.e. the region of the brain which plays an important role in memory processes, control of emotions, reaction to stress. ""We have found genetic regulators of gene expression acting in this region of the brain,"" said the biologist, ""We hope that this research will bring us closer to understanding the role of these genes in shaping hippocampus function,"" she added. Dr. Jasinska tells us what her work looks like. ""Within the framework of this research I do such different activities as fieldwork, i.e. examining animals on their natural populations - these include collecting observations and taking samples for testing, chucking, releasing them back into the natural environment - by DNA or RNA analysis for bioinformatic interpretation"" - she lists. ( PAP )"
2425,"The doctor is nice, but she gave me the medicines twice without any tests and it turned out later that the cause of the disorder was different and she didn't have a chance to diagnose it from the interview itself. It's not worth spending money on unnecessary drugs and wasting time. I advise against it."
2426,"My assessment is so far only preliminary and does not concern the quality or characteristics of the product itself but the way it is marketed. The product bought in SHOP DENT via the Internet has no information in Polish - neither on the packaging nor in the accompanying leaflet - from which you could learn how to use the product, what concentration is safe. After all, it is a chemical agent that removes scale, and therefore invasive. If I am not mistaken, you cannot market goods in Poland without information in Polish."
2427,"Best New Year's Eve she's ever been to. There's not even one thing you can stick to. The hotel staff is very nice and helpful, the organization of the event very good. The orchestra played a variety of music (something good for everyone:) . The food was very tasty and varied, even I would say too much. The rooms are also cozy and, most importantly, everywhere clean and neat. I will certainly not go back there and I recommend : )"
2428,"Being in November at the seaside, you are mainly counting on hotel attractions, because the weather is not very good for walking on the beach. We have chosen with friends the hotel because it has beautiful swimming pools especially the one with salt water in which you can relax in the evening with the fireplace on and moody lighting and the music coming out of the water completes the pleasure of relaxation. As far as food is concerned, it is tasty and abundant with lots of fruit and salads. However, we didn't like the fact that while playing bowling no one informed us that they are paid only we were credited with the amount of drinks we ordered. Anyway, the bartender was not very pleasant and the drinks were expensive and without revelation because a simple vodka with cherry juice and ice 25zl is a slight exaggeration. I also think that 30 PLN for parking in front of the hotel is too much. But generally I recommend this hotel because we came back rested and relaxed."
2429,"She reported me with a child with a sore finger to the E.R. . The doctor didn't even look well, he just rudely commented that he didn't want to come earlier, only at 11pm. 00 (it was already at 19. At 00, but due to the ""excellent"" organization of work, I was accepted after 4 hours). He unwittingly wrote out an x-ray referral. The arrival was justified because my finger was broken. Rude, rude, not to say rude. Maybe she could understand my frustration at the bad organization of work, but you can not show your dissatisfaction to the patient. Everyone should be respected, especially the patient by the doctor. Behaviour of such people creates a negative image of the doctor. I definitely do not see the passion that the doctor talks about in the introduction. I do not recommend contact with this uncultured person."
2430,"Maybe a good professional knows his stuff, but no delicacy when doing colonoscopy with inflammation of the intestine, he had a great fun that I was in pain and he was laughing! In addition to the teasing that she was pushing herself to the hospital as if she was dying of pain for more than 24 hours at home, no sense of delicacy and a sense of humor that offends any human dignity! ! No approach as to man treated me in such a state as an angry child who dreams of spending the candle in the hospital under an IV! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
2431,"The hotel is clean, well maintained. Situated in a good and quiet location, behind the street a pebble beach along which a nice promenade stretches. Meals are varied, but for those who do not eat seafood very poor choice. The hotel staff is ok (except for the bartenders - they behaved as if they were there for a punishment. In the hotel average age 70 + , not suitable for families with children. If someone is going on holiday with Ithaca on All Inclusive, they will find a slight shock. No snacks, drinks and alcohols only after 2 p.m., change meal hours, swimming pools open at 10:00 p.m. Complaints are of course not respected because they find some answer to everything. I DO NOT RECOMMEND LEAVING WITH ITAKA"
2432,"OW Columbus is an ideal place for every family. Mr. Wojtek and his crew make holidays in Rowy ALWAYS a success. Very nice rooms that are always clean. Great food for small and large. The resort has many attractions for children and the number of children makes children can ""disappear"" for a few hours.) The most important is the super nice family atmosphere. All always smiling helpful. I recommend a super holiday to everyone"
2433,"I highly recommend Villa Lavender, especially for staying with children - beautiful, spacious rooms (I was in a room with a large terrace in the garden), a lot of facilities for children (playroom, playground in the beautiful garden, armchairs, pots), close to the main promenade, but still on the side street (silence), an ideal place for trips to the beautiful Table Mountains. In the very nice and helpful service. We were in 5 families - a total of 10 children and 10 adults - we were all very happy."
2434,"The hotel's beautiful clean, friendly service with a lot of space by the pool and on the beach there was no need to get up at 6am to take the beds, the food delicious all day long you can eat. We were on a family holiday of 10 people including 4 children. Every day in the amphitheatre show time you can play until 2 am. For the children the club is open twice a day and in the evening mini disco. I recommend this hotel with a clear conscience."
2435,"She's a wonderful man. In addition to being a great psychologist and a lotion for the spirit, she also deals with suits for marriage annulment. She has dealt with my case honestly and with great care and commitment. On this ecclesiastical path it is important that someone who helps us is competent and professional. This is half the success. She has always been in contact with me at various stages of the bishop's court. She has always been in touch with me at different stages of the bishop's court. She is an angel, not a man. Thanks to her professionalism, after a year and a half she received a marriage annulment. I recommend and greet"
2436,"She was with a doctor with a three-month-old child who is suspected of milk intolerance/allergy. The doctor didn't even look at him, let alone examine him. He was unpleasant and it was clearly felt that there was no time for the patient. He answered all my questions ""I don't know"". They asked us for a certificate which would allow the paediatrician to write down cheaper milk. Unfortunately we did not receive it. We were only informed that one private visit was not enough for a certificate. The doctor seems incompetent, as my knowledge of infant nutrition was greater than that of an allergologist. What can be confirmed by the doctor's idea of a diet - only how to introduce it when an infant eats only milk. . . ."
2437,"In July she spent a wonderful four days with her family in one of the apartments. The apartment was spacious - two bedrooms and a living room, clean and well maintained, and in the kitchen the nice owner left the most needed products such as coffee, tea, fruit, cold drinks. In addition, we were close by everywhere, because to the Trevi Fountain - a few minutes walk. Next to the Hotel Piazza del Popollo."
2438,"A disaster like no other, if I wrote about everything that happened during 5 days of my stay you would be bored to read. In short, the cat jumped on the table in the canteen and pissed on it during dinner, there was no water almost 3 days with breaks (I can understand that the pipes broke, but not the behavior of the owner who was soaping his eyes saying that he will be in two hours and left people to suffer even without apologizing for the inconvenience). The lack of information flow between the staff, lack of possibility to use the pool (I would add that the offer had an unlimited limit, but I'm not surprised that the sanitary facility had so much time hesitated or put this poorly constructed ""miracle"" to use). The Internet is missing during the whole stay, the fight for food in the cafeteria and burnt light bulbs on the stairs so you can break down, for example, when you go down to the ""gym"" (even though they informed us about a fault when we were leaving, there was still no light bulb). The whole stay no one was cleaning in our room, as there was no toilet paper, you had to go ask at the reception desk with all the other people, and the lack of heating in the rooms so I got a pretty strong cold right after I came back. . . . . . .that's as much to decide for yourself if it's worth it. I'm a person who doesn't need much to be lucky, but I think when someone advertises on the internet and is called a spa then they should take care of the customer and not erase the money and have everything in their nose. A holiday without satisfaction is a bad holiday, I do not recommend! For this money (130 per day) you can find a much better place, with professional service and a non-saving owner."
2439,"The hotel is located in a building from 2 to 6 floors. Relatively low price with continental breakfast included. Location very close to Arreiro metro station. Access from the airport about 10 - 15min ( cost about 10 euro ) . Good starting point for exploring the various attractions of Lisbon . Across the street a bus stop . In the immediate vicinity there are also several inexpensive restaurants where you can have lunch, coffee or cake. On the other side of the street there is also a cheap Pingo Doce market - where you can buy the most necessary things of everyday life. As far as accommodation is concerned, there are rooms to suit the price. Some of them, however, need to be renovated (visible damp walls and mould on them, bathrooms that have not been renovated for a long time, a hotel on a very busy street - sometimes it is quite noisy from the street. As a plus you can assume - in most rooms well functioning air conditioning, efficient and failure-free free WiFi in the rooms, clean bed linen and changed towels (it is worth to leave a few euros on the bed for the staff will bring better results in terms of clean towels and bed linen). When going to this hotel do not forget to choose cash - in our case on two cards - none of them worked at the reception while paying for the stay. The service is nice and helpful, you can get along in English and Spanish. There are 2 lifts in the building."
2441,"also highly recommended, everything has probably already been said, nice, nice and student friendly professor problem "" spec y"
2442,"Well, I used Dr. Tyca's services many times when he had the office for the Renaissance (fatal conditions), but recently I had severe abdominal pains and appeared in him on John Paul II. The office was very nice, but the doctor was outraged that she had not registered with him before. He raised the prices, but he lost kindness to people. He finally performed an ultrasound on me and found nothing. A few days later doctor Krzysztof Szczepaniak, Ph.D. in the Home Army (he noticed something) recommended to do a vaginal doopler examination. He has much lower rates for services. Today I am already after surgery . If it wasn't for his doubts, he would probably have suffered from pain until today and it would have ended much worse because the endometriosis foci ""caught"" the intestines. It's a pity, because once Mr. Tyc was the best in Lubin not only in my opinion, but also in many other people."
2443,"The hotel is picturesquely situated, covered with the waters of the lake from 2 sides. There is a place to walk. Right on the shore of the lake, gym and playground. The room and bathroom are very spacious and modernly furnished. Large balcony - without armchairs and large panoramic windows overlooking the water. Eating ok . but without fireworks . In the hotel free atmosphere . The swimming pool is supposed to be long but narrow and with irregular 1 side - with different swimming. Attention: early and punctual closing - unless at 21 . The biggest minus for a children's playroom - small, not very attractive. With a mezzanine built in - I don't know for what purpose - where it smells badly. If it wasn't for weekend animations, it's just a colourful room with a few books and blocks."
2445,"Located 2km from the centre of Funchal in the hotel zone, the access to the hotel is very difficult for older guests (you could put on a moving belt). The room has not been renovated for years with old equipment with a kitchenette and a small balcony, two elevators working without floor signaling, good service, prices of drinks for dinner such as water at draconian prices (bottles not closed originally - water poured not closed originally for 3, 20 euros 0, 75l is an exaggeration, in the restaurant stuffy. Internet connections weak."
2446,"Mirowska Nella , PhD Laboratory of Physics Attitudes has space requirements and is yelling at students. Avoid like fire ."
2447,"The dose of exposure and the moment when it can be applied is important in the fight against cancer. Whether or not the moment is right is determined by, among other things, the partial oxygen pressure, which can be understood as the oxygen concentration. This parameter changes during the day and depends on many factors. With such information, doctors know that radiation will destroy cancer and not healthy cells. They can regulate the dosage of the therapy, which will make it less painful, more personalized and has fewer side effects. Diagnostics aim to expose the tumors just when the oxygen level is at its highest. The animal studies confirm this possibility. It is important in brain cancers, the eye, or small organs in children."
2448,"A magical place, a garden soothes the nerves and enchants with its tranquility. Hospitality makes you feel special. The aesthetics of the place, the creator's imagination, moderation, flash of madness make the gate seem to be a link with another world: ) My wife and daughter and I spent a very nice and peaceful and joyful time there. The food was delicious, the breakfasts were delicious, and the coffee was stimulating by its very smell. We recommend this oasis of taste, sophistication and calm."
2449,"In his opinion, one of the most innovative points of the Polish solution is the use of an appropriate mixture of polymers, which will be biodegradable after nerve regeneration. ""With their help we are able to direct the nerve during self-regeneration of the defect. Additionally, after fulfilling their function, the tubes will be biodegradable, i.e. they will dissolve in the body"" - he stressed . Thanks to this, after the nerve regeneration it will not be necessary to repeat the surgery related to the removal of the implant. Another innovative solution is to place a polysaccharide hydrogel inside the tube, which provides support for the re-growing nerve and is also a carrier of growth factors, i.e. biomolecules necessary for proper and fast nerve reconstruction. The hydrogel is synthesized inside the tube and at the same technological stage it is simultaneously sterilized - added Dr Wach ."
2450,"Tragic place . Like living from the land of PiSiors, with a rude owner. . . Dirty, shit. The rooms stink. Next to the restaurant - DORSZ frying room, with great food and cool, cheerful service, but these are probably other owners. The bar of the People's Republic of Poland with great food, the best said would be in Niechorze. As for the hotel, it is still necessary to mention the lack of parking. Internet is a mockery."
2451,"The hotel itself is very well-equipped, however, it has never yet covered such distances from the reception desk to its room, and bad luck would have it that it took away my bag without wheels. A very nice swimming pool and basically an aquapark with saunas, which unfortunately are a bit too small for the number of people who want to stay, plus there is a hanging bucket with cold water and a tub, which you can enter and cool down instead of just a shower. A tasty but overpriced restaurant. The staff at the reception desk would expect a little more creativity and professionalism, a little bit more information about breakfast and the location of the room and that's it. . . No one informed me that a credit card authorization was necessary to use the restaurant without cashing in the room number. Fortunately, I had cash with me in the restaurant."
2452,"as a prelate of the fair sex, I can tell you that the leader was generally ok. The fact asks a lot of questions, especially for girls, but then it adds up to a circle just studying one night and it is ok :)"
2453,"A hotel not from this era! Literally ! There is an unpleasant smell of cigarettes and old age all over the hotel. The rooms ""smell"" sometimes very old, unfortunately the wardrobe smelled so unpleasant that I could not even hang my shirt there. The bathroom is terrible! The white ""curtain"" which was very dirty was to protect the bathroom from flooding, unfortunately the shower was so close to the door that it was impossible and please flood ready. The cleanliness also left much to be desired. . . The room had no air conditioning. I literally disgusted to use the room - unfortunately. And the prices for the room were not low at all. The restaurant wasn't very impressive either. . . Breakfast was still on the upside, but the rest unfortunately not anymore. In general, I do not recommend this facility either for leisure or business meetings."
2454,"I hesitate between good and neutral. The doctor met me on a visit to Luxmed, she was quite nice and took the time for an interview and ultrasound of the heart of my 8 year old child. She didn't explain much, but she answered questions. She wrote us a referral to the hospital, where we did the appropriate tests, which did not show any abnormalities. Since we are not in Lublin, she talked to one of the nurses about sending the discharge and examinations by mail, which was not to be a problem. Today the doctor called and, in not very kind words, asked if we were going to pick up the results and when. Not the time and place to summarize the conversation, but I think that in the professional contacts of people of public trust a certain level of culture should apply. It was a triviality, while the level of condescension and rudeness reached zenith. I think that no one should be exposed to such treatment, hence the NEUTHER."
2455,"The best holiday we've had: ) so many attractions for children and parents that we did not have enough time to take advantage of everything (unfortunately we were only 7 days old). Definitely the best hotel we have ever been to: ) everything's great, there's nothing to get attached to. We highly recommend all families with children: )"
2456,"The hotel is beautifully located, but access especially in the evening to the easy should not be easy, very steep driveways and not very good signs. The hotel is very large, the space in the dining room is even scary. The food is very varied from seafood exquisite poultry and vegetarian dishes but unfortunately mostly cold. The area encourages hiking and the auqapark is very relaxing if there are no crowds. A luxurious hotel but I prefer smaller and more atmospheric - what a matter of taste"
2457,"""In Poland, thyroid cancer is diagnosed annually in approx. In Poland thyroid cancer is diagnosed annually in about 2,500 people, more often women. In 90% of cases the course of the disease is mild and patients live for decades without a relapse. However, in about 10% of patients the disease is very aggressive, quickly leading to metastases and death. These people should be treated very intensively from the beginning, but so far they have not been identified. Thanks to genetic testing it will now be possible"" - informs the Foundation for Polish Science in its communication. Doctors and geneticists from the Medical University of Warsaw, the Centre for New Technologies of the University of Warsaw and the Institute - Centre for Oncology in Warsaw have shown that the course of the disease is related to the presence of an inborn lesion in the DIRC gene3 . The presence of the mutation in the gene allows to qualify the patient as a high-risk group. Thanks to the fact that the mutation can be determined already at the stage of therapy planning, it is possible to modify the scope of surgery and complementary treatment."
2458,"I, on the other hand, have a final uninteresting adventure with the Doctor, although I was very pleased for a long time. Yes, she is nice, supportive, takes care of the atmosphere and commissions research. Probably when there are no health problems, the assessment can only be positive. I went to p Doctor 1, 5 years, of which we have been trying to have a child for a year, to no avail. The doctor started training to treat infertility and unfortunately I can describe her case as the result of her unsuccessful experiments. Knowing that I have a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), she recommended lutein from the 16th day of the cycle, which, as she found out from the professor at the Invicta clinic, works as a contraceptive in my case. . . And so we lost a year of efforts with our husband."
2459,"In my case, it was the same - additionally, an examination of the ear canal and nose patency and a smear - obviously not fasting, because I paid immediately; - ) ) ) ( by the way, EVERY diagnostic station advises to do fasting swabs from the throat! ) . All in all, I left the office was broke (the cost of the visit has grown to over 200 zloty! ) with, as it turned out, a completely wrong diagnosis (I was supposed to be sick at night in the sinuses, which later turned out to be untrue - it excluded 2 wheeled laryngologists and specific radiological tests) and referring me to miraculous physiotherapy treatments, which potential charity Mr. Doctor was not kind enough to explain to me. I was also pushing for an appointment for the whole series (and when I said I couldn't do all of them, the Doctor said ""at least a few to make them work""; -) Luckily, for professional reasons, I could not. The Doctor was very interested in my material status, probably wanting to find out how much he could get out of me. According to me, if a doctor makes an erroneous diagnosis, it is either incompetent or premeditated, not for the sake of the patient, but driven by a vile desire (you -) for profit. That's why I put the lowest possible score to Dr. Kozok. I agree with the opinion that his practices should be looked at by the institution responsible for the medical environment. I also add that the positive opinions about Dr. Kozok presented below look very suspicious - one can notice that they are created ""wholesale"" in response to any negative opinions and apart from the statements of the ""miracle doctor"" type, they do not contain any specifics - on the contrary to negative opinions. When I read the negative opinions, I said over and over again: ""It's just like me! ""because I was there and I saw it. Greetings!"
2460,"Some time ago, Dr. T. Matuszewski as a plastic surgeon was enlarging my breasts. It turned out to be a terrible thing, I don't have any money for a change and I've been struggling with these pads almost under my chin for years. As a very nice and friendly man, but as a plastic surgeon he gave a terrible stain. For bust correction I absolutely do not recommend. She would like to inform me that she took advantage of the proposed free check-up visit. I must admit that I am pleasantly surprised by the willingness to help and selflessness of Dr. T . Matuszewski . Everything is on the right track to remove the problem . I will not hesitate to inform about the results ."
2461,"What is most striking is that instead of elevators or traditional staircases, the hotel's floors are connected by ramps, which are easy to climb with both skis and bikes. The second specific element is that the vestibule of each room is equipped with a glass anti-burglary door, a ski or bicycle storage room. This solution is a bit contrary to the rules of modern hospitality and above all to the economy, because such vestibules take up valuable space, which could be sold as another hotel room."
2462,"The guy's a good talker, he's a good laugher, but he's a terrible guy. Attention This gentleman and this subject is the first threshold (maybe still half a line) on which the students are massacred. Attention and full mobilization ( this may not be enough )"
2463,"I strongly advise against it. He invested 80 PLN for, attention, 3 minutes of the visit. The visit was extended to 5 minutes as with the request to write a prescription, which he did very reluctantly with the rest. She showed me a file of tests - including ultrasound and urine test. On the ultrasound (done in another office), sand on my kidney came out, there was a large number of bacteria in my urine and the results were not too good at all, besides I have to go to the bathroom every hour. She found out that ""such my beauty that I often pee"" (doctor's words). On my words, that I am often grabbed by a sharp pain in the area of the left kidney said it was nothing like that. And the pain continues. In general, the doctor with grace allowed me to enter the office, and at least that's how it feels. In a word - much worse than on nfz! As if that wasn't enough, when the ""nice"" lady registered on the phone 10 times before, she said that she ""doesn't understand this name"". And from the doctor she got a prescription for. . . . . .over-the-counter herbal pills. I don't know what she paid m for. Paranoia. Shame, Doctor. . ."
2464,"I have been using the device for 2 weeks, unfortunately, the price is not adequate for the operation of the device, the shaver does not cope with neck shaving and I irritate when shaving dry, when shaving wet, there are no irritations but it is far from the manufacturer's description and accurate shaving because it is still not perfect and the neck is still unshaven. It's possible that I found some flimsy specimen that I can't replace, so I CATEGORIALLY advise against it! ! ! PLUSES: water resistance, solid workmanship, cleaning station, trimmer, brush, quick battery landing, nice modern design. MINUS: high price for which I expected a quick, accurate and delicate shave, unfortunately, the razor is a typical average for up to 250zl."
2465,"I was satisfied with the examination, as the doctor not only performed the recommended examination, which was consistent with the referral, but also, at my request, performed additional services. He provided me with mental comfort during the examination, because anyway the doctor, and I try to avoid them with a wide arch. I am satisfied with the examination. I recommend ."
2466,"I don't recommend, breakfasts are monotonous and of little value. The boss doesn't know what a customer is. He is there out of compulsion and effectively makes his stay more difficult. . . Watch out for the air conditioning option. No office is publishing information about it and there you'll be faced with unpleasant charges. WiFi is rubbish, it only works at the reception desk and is quick as a retired mouse, it's a waste of time! Generally, every step of the way an unpleasant disappointment, I am reminded of the film ""All Inclusive""."
2467,"Unfortunately I promised myself that I would not visit this place anymore, but unfortunately a friendly company from the south of Poland, booked this hotel and unfortunately I had to sleep in it again. BABY! Once again and again a great disappointment when it comes to cleanliness, service, food and general impression. This hotel really doesn't deserve 4 stars, I honestly don't know where it comes from, but it's possible that during the check they paint the grass green, but as standard something doesn't suit me here. I advise against Hotel ANDERS - I recommend a trip to Olsztyn and there accommodation in a different hotel than the one in which the only thing that is really great is the location and views, but it is not thanks to employees or managers."
2468,"The lecture and exercises are clear . Bogdan is a positively twisted man . With the credit for the problems, there is nothing you can do. I highly recommend."
2469,"It was my first time, sir. Adach is a nice man and concrete, I know what to do next, it is important to me because she had my research file and she did not know what to do, what to worry about and what not, now I know. She made an appointment for my next visit, then I will be able to write more specifically."
2470,"The Doctor is a nice person. Many times she has used her advice quite unofficially in the hospital corridor. She relied on her opinion when she was pregnant, she was going to breastfeed and unfortunately now I have to consult my baby. She wanted me to meet the same doctors in her life."
2471,"In simple terms, the system consists of a scoring of individual elements of the infrastructure and services provided by the facility and the qualification of the facility for a given category based on the sum of the points achieved. An important - and not existing in the Polish categorization regulations - element is the fact that the lack of e.g. a reception desk with a lobby or breakfast does not deprive the facility of the possibility to become a hotel. Today, after four years of operation, the categorisation system according to Hotelstars Union rules is already in force in 15 European countries. These are : Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and Sweden."
2472,"He wanted the doctor to clean my ear but said it wasn't necessary. He went to another doctor today who took a lot of wax out of my ear. He also said the larynx is ok and the larynx hurts and has a dry cough. One of the medications he prescribed for me turned out to be for hay fever and allergies that are not present in me and not in this case he went 'em there. After this medication I had my nose clogged with blood in the morning, I hope it didn't damage anything. The lady in the pharmacy also asked what kind of doctor it is, because there is no specialty given on the stamp. In a conversation, Mr. Nice. I don't know this gentleman because he was 'em in Grudziac passing by. I know one thing, I wouldn't go there anymore."
2473,"I'm sorry, but I can't say that I'm positive about the hotel. Apart from the size standards, it has nothing to do with the three stars. The room: cobwebs, paint is out, curtains by the rails Black and there is a piece of furniture - a coloured leather armchair from which leather is out. The bathroom has not been renovated since the 70s. You write that there is a parking lot - but it is accessible to the public several hundred meters underground and with suitcases you have to drag. . It's a pity - such a good location and so neglected."
2474,"A beautiful hotel, in every detail. The rooms were ok, we had a room of a higher standard, it was very spacious. Annoying fan in the bathroom running for a minute or more. Breakfast and dinner ok - a big choice, tasty but not always fresh bread. As for the SPA, there are no reservations - everything is as positive as possible. The biggest minus of the whole stay was the atmosphere in the hotel. The staff walking as if they had a stick tied to their back. Reception of the massacre - neither good morning nor smile - nothing! We had purchased a package with several treatments in the SPA. They were booked in advance for us in such hours that nothing else could be planned during our stay in the hotel - we always had to hurry. And the last treatment is already paranoia - it was ordered for the day of departure at 12 o'clock - where you have to check out at 12 o'clock. After reporting the problem, we heard that it was only for our hands, so we can pack up to the car in advance and just come up for a moment for the treatment. In the end, we did not go to the treatment because we wanted to leave early enough not to rush home. It was our honeymoon, but today I regret very much that we decided to go to this hotel. We spent a lot of money and in return we found ourselves in a place where everything is puffed up and buffeted, nobody smiles and even other guests look down on others."
2475,"Hello. I strongly recommend Dr. Rafał Olejnik. At the end of February I had a severe kidney stone attack. At first, I thought that this attack is a one-off event and more will not happen. Unfortunately, after a week I was attacked again by terrible pains. I found myself in a hospital in Opole. He was happy for me, because despite the strong pain I was able to withstand it thanks to the pain drip. After 5 days the pain attack was over. Unfortunately, the stones did not come out! I was discharged and advised to report to the clinic in 2 weeks. After leaving the hospital the pain made it impossible for me to take up my normal job, not to mention driving a car, which caused an immediate attack. A few days later I was admitted to the urological ward of the hospital in Kedzierzyn-Kozle. There I could also get to know Dr. Olejnik more closely. He is very committed to his work. You could say he puts his whole heart into it . This can be seen by the fact that after a whole day of hard work he can still smile at patients and find patience to once again explain to them things that are obvious to him and difficult or incomprehensible to the patient. The doctor finds time for each patient, creating a friendly atmosphere in the ward. This is especially important when you are waiting for a procedure or an operation and you are necessarily under a lot of stress and don't really know what awaits you. To sum up, doctor Olejnik is a competent, sensitive man who can talk to the patient. Once again I would like to thank Dr. Olejnik, thanks to whom my suffering has ended and my stay in hospital was not so terrifying for me."
2476,"""Same treatment is not acceptable,"" said prof. Hryniewicz . Antibiotics should be used only with the doctor's knowledge, while 5 - 10% of patients take them on their own. Moreover, patients do not take these drugs as they should, i.e. in the right dose, at the right time and for the recommended period. If they do not, there is too little concentration of the drug in the body, some bacteria survive and acquire immunity. The experts admitted that it is not without guilt that there are doctors who too often succumb to pressure from patients to demand effective antibiotics. As a result, they are often prescribed unnecessarily for viral infections that they do not act on, such as the cold and flu and pharyngitis. Only 15% of adults with upper respiratory tract infections have indications to use antibiotics, while 70% of patients receive them."
2477,"The Unicorn Forester's lodge is located in the forest, far from the main roads. Converted into a guesthouse, it consists of two buildings, one with a kitchen, dining room and several guest rooms. In the second one there is a large common room with TV and billiards, and upstairs there are new rooms. The main attraction of this place, apart from its location, is the possibility of horse riding. In August 2012, there were two large horses and one pony available. You can take riding lessons, ride on a lunge, and more advanced riders can take a ride in the forest. In the forester's lodge there is a representative of the smallest horse species, there are also two sheep and a very friendly female Sabinka. The rooms have their own atmosphere, but they are a little bit dusty - long-washed dust on the furniture, cobwebs on the ceiling, blankets, upholstery rather un-washed and unrefreshed. In the pictures it looks better. The whole kitchen, giving out meals for a dozen or so people, cleaning and preparation of rooms was done by only one lady. The local hostess was very nice, but she couldn't handle everything. The meals were very tasty, especially the soups we tasted. A couple of times we ate delicious apple pancakes straight from the frying pan. Unfortunately, the local excellent honey, served daily at breakfast, we did not manage to eat with fresh bread once. I generally consider my stay in Unicorn to be successful, the children were delighted with the contact with animals and did not worry about the dust. However, I think that the hosts could be a little more involved in running the guesthouse. They were completely relaxed, chatting with the guests (which they boasted about), watching movies on a notebook on the terrace and did not seem interested in correcting their shortcomings. For example, the guesthouse had six clocks, none of which were walking! ; ) Luckily, the mentioned slack also included the settlement issues - the owner approached us with confidence and understanding, and for my twelve-year-old daughter he counted as if she were a child, although theoretically she was already covered by the adult rate."
2478,"I highly recommend your doctor! Competent, trustworthy, with a high level of personal culture, a specialist who makes an accurate diagnosis. I am pregnant and I was afraid that there will be no effective treatment for me, it turned out that your doctor found for me safe and effective treatment. What is unique to me is that the doctor is in contact with the patient as to his or her condition (she received a message reminding me of the recommendations), in case of my questions the doctor was always willing to answer, or he or she called back when he or she could not answer the phone. I would like to add that I could go to the appointment the next day, after the phone call. Thank you, Doctor! ! Karolina"
2479,"At the end of my stay, while I was cleaning, a few personal items (small, but nevertheless disappeared) disappeared from my room. When checking out, the reception did not even apologize for the fact. They promised to solve the case quickly. I was supposed to wait for a contact from the hotel - but this did not happen. The correspondence e - mail initiated from my side was broken by the hotel. She called me. They were supposed to contact me. It's been 3 months since the fact and the case is swept through the carpet. ATTENTION - my sister met the same situation 3 months before me ! That's why I was sensitive to the fact. In my opinion the hotel staff is incompetent. After all, it is not a problem to check in the schedule who exactly cleaned our room that day and draw consequences. The hotel did not offer anything. What's worse, as she wrote, she didn't even hear a word I'm saying when I applied. The staff of the case is oiling and pretending that nothing has happened. From the hotel I don't want anything, no compensation - it's just about ordinary human honesty and taking care of the customer's welfare. A hotel with interesting facilities in general, but this should not happen. Theft of property from a room - in such a hotel? I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!"
2480,"Generally, the office is quite strange. It has been treated by Dr. Kuźminski for a long time, but last year in winter I had to use another doctor's help because the doctor left for a few days. In the office she found a renovation and a general contempt. And since the front door was being renovated, I was ordered to enter the office (and leave) through the window! ! ! Generally, however, with the services of Dr. Kuźmiński I am satisfied, but I absolutely confirm the necessity of sitting in the waiting room in a jacket, scarf, hat and gloves."
2481,"As for 4 stars poor service (I really don't require much, but daily room cleaning and normal pieinny bath towels are standard) erroneous spa entries (always the client's fault), and terrible translations into English! It's rather embarrassing."
2482,"International standards of electrical work are slipping, very boring? ? ? presence / or colloquium - the neutral stiffener can be (but only due to the type of credit) Prof . has the gift of immersion. Do not sleep, because it wakes up : lol : . If you hide the newspaper well, you will read: D Generally speaking, the advantage is that if you have 100% presence, you have 3. If you have not walked, you write a circle on which there are very good grades anyway. The student is too stupid (in some cases he is not wrong: twisted :), he does not say it directly, but the texts are typical, they did not read this information in the newspaper because you were interested in the mandarin or will add """
2483,"Rooms in very different standards. When you booked, you were informed that the rooms are being renovated and everything will be OK for our arrival. Because it was a group trip and they rented all the rooms we had to be the whole guesthouse for us. Upon arrival, it turned out that one room is occupied by someone else, and upon departure, we heard that you have a lesson not to connect groups with individuals! ! ! As for meals and staff I have no reservations."
2484,"I'll start with but. . . . .which is an awfully small and ugly bathroom. Dimensions 1, 5 and 2 m. Someone bigger will have a problem to fit in it. And it's basically just that, but, of course, you can get attached, with the furniture in the old room but generally the room is big and clean (describes a room for 2 people). There is a fridge, kettle, coffee machine, cups. The air conditioning is included in the price, the WiFi throughout the hotel for free. What this hotel wins with others and you can even experience this micro bathroom is a very nice, large and neat swimming pool, the area around the pool and a beautiful view of the mountains. The plus is that the pool is open up to 24, of course nobody drips then but there is a drink bar, music playing, you can sit on the deck chairs by the pool. There is never a war for sun loungers because there is always a lot of free time. The hotel itself is a small 80 pairs of rooms, also the peace and quiet without animation. Distance from the beach is 1 km, about 10 minutes and the beach is beautiful, long, sandy and well developed. Price for two deckchairs and an umbrella of 8 euros. Tigaki is a very nice town, basically one main street along it with bars and a couple of shops. Lots of Greek taverns with really good food, 4 travel agencies organizing tours in Polish. To the city of Kos 10 km bus 2 , 10 euro one way. Bicycles: highlander day 5 euros . To sum up: if I was going back to Tigaki, I would probably choose this hotel because it is just nice. As for the bathroom, what do we treat me and my husband as such a curiosity and it does not bother us especially. Especially, that we came here to lie on the beach, eat good Greek food and a little sightseeing and not think about the size of the bathroom."
2485,"Course : Company Finances Evaluation : I recommend [ / b ] If anyone is interested, this course is even interesting. If you do not want to listen, you do not have to. You can learn something calmly just to not talk, because for talking is absence. He gives marks based on presence. For all or one of them there is 5.0, for every next 0, 5 marks down. It is possible to get 5.5 on an individual query. : )"
2486,"The easiest way to list the advantages and disadvantages of the place (from the point of business departure) Disadvantages - poor service (cleaning rooms and related activities is a big minus, unfortunately, either the management is lame or the staff is not listening to the employees) - meals in the restaurant (e.g. breakfasts until 10 : 30 - unfortunately, around 10 : 00 everything is swept away and there is no chance to add food) - evening and night service (nothing can be done here - no iron, water, etc.: the night service refers to the morning shift - preparation of the rooms (for the last moment cleaning and preparation of everything; faulty sound equipment). - poor wifi (in some rooms it is impossible to connect them) - price (definitely looking at the whole thing too expensive) Plusy - charming surroundings (lake, large green area) - beautiful, modern building (relatively new and not very damaged, although in the room it was found on the damaged door handle) - good food (varied, tasty breakfasts) - views, views and once again views - de luxe room large and comfortable Summary: as for 5 stars average. Work on the organization and service because you won't get far in the area itself."
2487,"When in 2014 she first bought m in store E - Glamour Euphoria (scented water) was m delighted, beautiful scent. I often change the perfume so after using the bottle ( 100 ml ) returned to him in 2017. Buying in the same shop as usual professionally only perfume not these. The same thing but, however, retains less like a floral, not lasting just 2 hours those clothes smelled even 2 days and here nothing. I can barely feel it. She wrote me to the store got me an answer that the smell has passed the so-called . reformulation of whatever it means and a lot of people just have reservations about durability and smell, the first purchase was still from the old line and now only the new one is available. I don't know how much truth in this I don't know about that but I do know that the companies are doing different stocks under cost cutting. Well that bought me only 50ml I will somehow get tired. It's a shame because it was a beautiful smell. I'm going back to the Burberry The Beat interesting how it will be here."
2488,"I don't recommend this place to NIKOM. 1 - to get to the front door you have to climb probably 100 stairs . 2 - you enter the bunker like the receptionist's lights are off - you have to wait until you get out of the back room . 3 - a room on the 2nd floor - high steps in the staircase are not very handy to enter and there is no elevator and you have to look for the room in the dark - it is good that I have a flashlight on my phone . 4 - the room can't be, although an old rotten apple covered with dust fell out of bed. Bathroom does not houseta. 5 - breakfast - due to lack of guests breakfast was served in the reception hall. Modest 2 slices of cheese, 2 slices of cold meat, some tomato without taste and juice diluted with water. The general impression was very unpleasant, I felt like an undesirable person. More I will not come there for sure! ! !"
2489,"- room daily cleaned and towels changed - breakfast buffet (toasts, croissants, bread, some wedding meat, cheese, jam, honey, cereals, milk, quark, drinks) - nice service - wifi is only a free hour a day for the device - a little too far away from Toledo street - the district seems to be not interesting but it is safe, returning from Toledo to the hotel about 20 in the dark through small streets without any problems and no waiting times"
2490,"I had no pleasure to host two nights at the Chopin Hotel in Żary. The room did not resemble any folder rooms, it was average, the cheapest faucet in the bathroom, a tap in the washbasin short you can barely put your hand to wash your hands, a shower like this does not run down. The advertised delicious breakfasts are not tasty old products. The staff different one day friendly and brazen. Name Chopin? I don't know why, someone didn't have it in their head that they called him that. It would be better to have dirty windows."
2491,"I also have this problem with New Year's Eve. Booking in November . No response to emails after the holidays, and on December 30 a phone call with information about the cancellation of the Event and reservation . Also, we were already on our way. If by the end of the week I do not receive any information - I will report the case to the police."
2492,"Jerzy Starak, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Polpharma said during a press briefing that the first Polpharma Group biotechnology product will be registered in the USA in the first quarter of 2019. The product is to be introduced to the American market in 2020 and to the European market a year later. ""In the U.S. the patent expires earlier, in Europe we can only do it one year later"" - he explained . He expressed hope that ""the therapy will not change, because if it changes, the investment will pay for itself much longer. Starak announced that the next biotech product of Polpharma, a drug for multiple sclerosis, will be filed for registration in the U.S. in 2021 and will be implemented on the American market in 2022. He noted that work on one product takes about eight years."
2493,"DEAR LADIES, I RECOMMEND! ! ! ! ! ! DR . ISMAEIL SALLOUM IS A TRUSTWORTHY DOCTOR. HE CAN TALK TO THE PACTITE SO THAT SHE CAN UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. I HAVE BEEN GOING TO A DOCTOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS WHO WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO GAVE ME HOPE AND CURED ME - - - WITHOUT SURGERY - - I HAVE A HIGHLIGHT ( pomarances in size ) A BOX ON THE IATHER and WHICH THE BOTTLE BURNING OF THE EXPERIENCE ( incredibly painful ) And THE BOTTLE BOX ONLY, . . . .MANY OTHER DOCTORS REFERRED ME TO SURGERY AND SAID THERE WAS NO CURE FOR IT.

2494,"I've been to your doctor's twice. The first time she came together, the doctor was not nice, but she ordered all the research and so on. . . . .the second time, she turned out to be a nice person who diagnosed my problem correctly. . . . .she explained everything thoroughly. . . . .the first time, I and my clear conscience consider Dr. Otto's day ""a bad day"": - )"
2495,"This is a doctor with a vocation who will listen and advise you. In addition to his knowledge, he has an extraordinary sensitivity to other people. The best doctor I have ever had to deal with in my life, he is simply a very good man who is guided by the heart, to be his patient is an honour! I can recommend the Doctor with a clear conscience! ! ! ! ! !"
2496,"I go to see a doctor in Elk and sometimes when you have to wait a long time for a visit also to Augustow. He is always nice, he listens, he asks questions. When there was a problem with the implementation of the prescription, he quickly called back, contacted a medical representative and a pharmacy. So far my problem has not been solved yet. But I hope that one day this will happen."
2497,"In January this year, Mrs. Monika and Mr. Mieczysław organized a super party for my parents at the Hotel. It's been a long time since I've seen such a professional company, service and such good food at such events. I highly recommend this company and on my mind I feel like going to some delicious dinner. Waitresses smiling were still in the room making sure that we do not run out of anything."
2498,"If you don't have children, you'll end up here instead of resting, just don't come here. Everywhere you go, screaming, crying, children of all ages and mothers with children not yet born, who apparently chose this place or a nearby lake for the birth. The beach is a small eternal sea because it is in the shade. The children's entertainment is made by megaphones and on stage there is no noise from between 9 and 22 there is no quiet place in this resort, not much if you go to the other side of the lake you can also hear them. There is no peace and quiet within a 2km radius. Breakfast is ok big choice on the Swedish table. For other forms of food I suggest you go outside the resort. Food 3 out of 10, unsavoury lunches, buffet, price to quality in the restaurant with a choice of card is a joke. Steak = minced Ravioli chop with boletus = frozen iglotex in a diluted cheese sauce with melted cheese. Board of fish ? = Mint and another fish (weight 160g), chips and salad = 38zł Attention if a child unexpectedly makes a pile in the restaurant functions selling pampersow in every size I suppose z on pieces . You want to sail it as far as possible from the depths of children's entertainment, which is located right here in the middle of the woods, has passed from civilization. The price of the stay was guaranteed 2 hours of sailing, but apparently the petty officer has us in deep respect, despite our attempts to determine when he will be able to make the cruise. Asking for 4 days hasn't worked, we give up our stay 3 days before the end because we can't stand it anymore."
2499,"The Hotel Mitsis Rhodes Maris has five stars, but it doesn't deserve that much, it has very good reviews on various portals, maybe that's why it was so disappointing in what it found. After arrival on the site it turned out that there is no room available for us, we were accommodated in another hotel, only on the second day of the afternoon we could go back to Mitsis Maris, that is two days of weekly rest were disturbed to a large extent. The rooms deserve at most four stars, they are damp, they smell of mould, they do not have a typical air conditioning, only the air conditioning, when switched on it smells even more mouldy. The hotel staff is helpless in many situations. Tasty meals and a large selection of dishes, but always queues at the entrances to restaurants, in cafes a large selection of alcohol and drinks, also different types of coffee, hot chocolate. The hotel is close to the beach, pebble and rocky pebble beach, but pleasant, with enough sun loungers, but by the pool of sun loungers very little and busy from the very morning."
2500,"Positive surprise for a two-star hotel - I have a lot of experience and the possibility of comparison. The hotel has been refreshed - the worst views from the photos no longer exist. The service is nice, and helpful, the rooms are cleaned every other day thoroughly, towels are changed every day. Food - there are fewer dishes to choose from as in better hotels. Whereas what is tasty and the cooks know their stuff. Delicious fish. For dessert after lunch and dinner melons, watermelons, peaches, oranges. Very tasty cakes with creams and delicious mousses. NOTE: in my room, there was no air-conditioning, nor did the people I met on the spot. This can be a big problem in the hottest months,"
2501,"Bacteria can take DNA from the environment and exchange genetic material among themselves. As a result of this process, known as recombination, they may become antibiotic resistant or effectively resistant to vaccines. Although the recombination process was discovered almost a hundred years ago, it was only with DNA sequencing - a method to read the genetic code - that we began to learn how often this process occurs and how much change it causes. Using the DNA fragments of bacterial strains, scientists can create an evolutionary family tree, showing at what point the bacteria have acquired new genes and how this has affected their evolution. This knowledge is particularly useful in analyzing the pathogenic bacteria that we fight with vaccination. Through sequencing, we can analyze the evolution of bacteria and, based on this information, try to predict when and where antibiotic-resistant or vaccine-insensitive strains will appear."
2502,"Average centre . Beautiful surroundings, average kitchen . Apartments I do not recommend . . . dirty carpet, cold, tap loose, radiators do not work . For this price. . . . .never again. This is not a stay worth the price. Definitely."
2503,"She wouldn't go there a second time. I don't understand the delight of the hotel. The room's awfully small, it's been a long time since she's seen me so small. After inserting the baby cot, there was practically no way and where to go. The praised breakfasts were no different from those served in other hotels, the choice and presentation of dishes did not knock down. The dishes from the card were average. Small swimming pool, 3 people in it is already crowded, maybe that is why there were only 3 sun loungers available. As for me it's too far from the market, maybe other guests do not mind. Very courteous service, especially the maids. Here a big smile towards them."
2505,"Since there were no tools for measuring hand muscle strength on the medical market, Olsztyn's specialists decided to create them. As a result, after several months of doctors and mechatronics technicians' work (in cooperation with the Institute of Fundamental Technological Problems of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw), a device was created which measures muscle strength in the hands of people suffering from SLA. It looks inconspicuous: it's a small box with two tinglers. The patients put their fingers on these two tinglers and press the tips with all their might. ""The device is very simple, but it is of fundamental importance to us because it measures the pressure of the patient's fingers. Thanks to the fact that the device is graduated we know whether this force is decreasing or constant"" - explained PAP Dr Siwek. He added that since the device is light and small, eventually patients will take it home and the results of the muscle strength test of their muscles will be sent by the device itself to the hospital."
2506,"I have a question. Is Dr. Jaworowski, about whom you write about, a son or a father, because Father Andrzej Jaworowski accepts on Centrum A and son Andrzej Piotr Jaworowski on Frycz Modrzewski . I have to choose a doctor and I really don't know which Jaworowski you are praising: Is it a father or a son ."
2507,"A great lecturer, he understands that a student is also a man! The student will not be harmed. Maybe not too interesting (a bit boring), but it is one of the most cool lecturers on the polybud. I recommend, recommend and once again recommend. No 1"
2508,"I've come to Dr. Gaidosz for a last-chance test. He has been suffering from depression for many years, and he suffers from many serious illnesses, which makes it impossible to take most of the psychotropic drugs. My condition was already tragic, I did not get up from bed, I did not eat, I did not see anyone. All day in bed in a dark room. None of the earlier doctors were able to help me. I decided to visit Dr. Gaidosz as the last rehearsal. And a miracle happened. I was cured. I don't know how it could have happened, but it worked. The Doctor is a miracle worker, he saved my life. He's incredibly good, warm, kind, dear. He treats every patient well and honestly. He's trying to find out as much detail as possible. He's a competent doctor and just a good person. He's really trying to help. I recommend him wholeheartedly. If you don't believe in the cure anymore, try going to Dr. Gaius, you won't regret it. Thank you for everything!"
2509,"She would recommend a doctor with a clear conscience. Accurate, gentle during the examination, pays attention to the patient, is able to listen with understanding and draw conclusions - which unfortunately is not a common phenomenon among doctors. He makes a correct diagnosis. In addition to undoubted knowledge and skills, she is characterized by personal culture and an unforced sense of humor."
2510,"Mrs. Ula came to me after a very bad experience with other psychologists. The first series of meetings helped our marriage, but not for long. After the dramatic experiences she decided to come back - apparently not everything was explained. After a six-month break Mrs. Ula remembered absolutely everything that was said during our previous visits. I was very impressed by her memory. The second series of meetings brought completely different results. Mrs. Ula's questions were so pertinent that they allowed me to find the real source of problems and the way to solve them. Ula is a great specialist and I can wholeheartedly recommend her, even though she has given up on giving us further consultations."
2511,"I discourage everyone from seeing this lady. I have been attracted by the good opinions and the website of the office and I went for the treatment of acne, hair loss and skin condition. From the very beginning, the lady has been acting as if she is doing me a favor, accepting the patient. She did not help at all. She said briefly that it was all hormonal fault, where I told her that my hormone results were very good. In addition, I was hoping that she could help me get some masks and cosmetics for my skin, and she said it was the right thing to do. So I ask you, what do you pay for? Lost money. Besides, it's important to expect that everyone will hear the whole conversation in the waiting room, and you make me feel like you want to get rid of the patient quickly."
2512,"The hotel is located on the outskirts of the city, it is far away everywhere, so if you want to see something, you should rent a car. It is close to the beach, the sun loungers there are free, which is a plus. There is a possibility to rent a car at the hotel. As for the advantages, that would be enough. The rooms may be a bit like the ones in the pictures, but unfortunately it's not the same. After the entrance, the first thing that caught the weight is the unpleasant smell, then the dirty curtains, the smeared mirrors, the miniature shower without a curtain. Unfortunately, during the bath the whole bathroom was flooded with water. No fridge in the room (its presence was mentioned in the hotel's offer) and a broken handle in the door (the door closed only with a key. . . So if you forgot to turn the key, everyone passing by the room could look there, and what's worse, enter). The staff was moderately nice. Only the owner was able to communicate in English, all the others pretended to understand something, and when you turn away from the guest you make a face like ""what did he mean? "" . The owner promised on the first day that the door will be fixed and the fridge will be placed in the room. . . . .unfortunately we didn't live to see that until the end of our stay. The food was pretty good if someone liked the food from the school canteen. Sometimes there wasn't much choice, because if you looked at what was served to the buffet, you sometimes refused to eat. Juice and beer watered down. A big plus is ice cream after lunch and dinner. They have very good wines and coffee. Cleaning the rooms inaccurate or not at all . The swimming pool is unfortunately neglected there, the drinking cups are banging in it and unfortunately it doesn't smell good there. They have a children's playground, which is also very cool. General assessment 3 / 5, because there was no tragedy."
2513,"Bioethicist prof . Jacek Hołówka from the Committee of Philosophical Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Pedagogue - Warsaw School of Social Sciences is of a different opinion - he believes that research on human embryos should be allowed. However, he agreed with Zoll's statement that the compromise adopted at the moment in some countries and setting a 14-day research limit is something arbitrary, it is a convention. However, as the Hollowcore noted, there are many similar conventions in society, such as the amount of the penalty for rape and the age at which a person reaches maturity.

2514,"Hmm, the nice lady from reception asked for an opinion about the hotel. Well, I can't remember your name, but you were nice. And the rest? Before making a reservation, she had some doubts, because she once heard me say that it was a hotel ""from prl"" . But I didn't have much choice, so she took a risk. The service was very nice, although at the reception desk she had to prove that the stay was paid for (despite having a text message confirming payment). Room? Beautiful view from the window on the 5th floor - to the bay and the square - especially at night. Very comfortable bed. Although my opinion is superfluous here are decorative pillows, which probably are not changed too often (she personally took them off my bed, because I do not know who slept on them before). A big desk. A fridge cabinet - perhaps waiting to be repaired, because the cabinet is a bit broken. And a strange smell in the room? ! You already know where this ""smell"" from - there is no ventilation in the bathroom, everything ""goes to the room"" . Using the toilet required pumping the ""jack"" of the cistern, only after 3 times you could drain the water. Nightmare! RestaurantThis breakfast, for 3 stars, is rather without revelation. The advantage was the possibility of baking delicious waffles with your own hands! This compensated for everything. Restaurant in the lobby. For wine gourmets a lot of choice, the service helps in making decisions: ) Pets are welcome, even without asking, they get a bowl of water. I recommend smoked fried sardines - a delicious snack. To sum up - when booking, ask about the room standard and then the rest will be ok."

2516,"First of all, a great tribute and thanks to the owners for the renovation of the Teutonic Knights' castle and the installation of a hotel in the historical style. The entrance, interior, character, props, courtyard absolutely match the style of the castle hotel. It is situated on a hill between two lakes in the centre of the town of Ryn. Rooms in historical style, but vary in size. The equipment corresponds to 4 * . The swimming pool and sauna complex is located on the ground floor with a beautiful cellar arrangement of the brick vault. Unfortunately, the swimming pool, which is small in relation to the number of rooms and guests, is used for taking pictures and wading than swimming. Breakfast in the restaurant matching the castle dining room in a modern version . Breakfast buffet is extremely diversified abundant, mostly with very good products. Everyone can arrange it for their own needs, also fit. Among the hotel staff there are extremely professional and cordial people, but unfortunately, some sellers and the process. I don't know if with a higher occupancy rate there is enough for all the parking spaces."
2517,"The weekend at the Odyssey Hotel is very successful. The apartment is spacious, clean and nicely furnished. Sauna area, with a salt pool at the top. Treatments performed professionally. So relaxed we haven't been dumb for a long time. But the greatest furore was the cream of tomatoes, pesto, parmesan and Greek yoghurt: ) The restaurant's portions are untraceable . But everything's so delicious that it's a shame to leave. We'll definitely go back to that hotel again: )"

The specialist pointed out that children should not be exposed to strong sunshine at 11-15 hours, and that they should be treated with filter creams, protective clothing and headgear. ""There are two ways of sunbathing: natural or artificial, but it should be remembered that the number of melanoma cases has doubled in the last 10 years. This also applies to solariums.

You are characterized by great dedication to your patients, indescribable professionalism and patience. Thanks to you my son has the opportunity to function normally and enjoy life. May God always graciously touch your hands and mind during surgery, here I will pray. There are no words to describe our gratitude for what your professor does for us. Mama Kacper from Slupsk"
2520,"Upon arrival, we did not receive all the detailed information about the services and attractions we have in the package. We had to ask our mother about various things, such as a fruit cocktail when and if we were actually entitled to a package or how to use the Finnish sauna. Generally the service was very good but at the reception desk not all the ladies were as open to the guest as they should be"
2521,"Nice and clean, very nice hosts. Own descent to the beach, away from the hustle and bustle of Sarbinowo center. View from the window (through the trees, but) to the sea. In minus: a little bit tight (narrow staircase, a little uncomfortable bed), little available power sockets, only one lamp to read over... . a double bed."
2522,"Professor Baron, maybe he's just so boastful, she's been treating me with him for over six months and nothing. She treated me for bruxism. . . . He was not cured by the rail, he rebuilt my bite, which was ok before. Now the pain is still not enough, I can't eat everything normally. And I will add that she lost me through this pseudo-healing good 1500 PLN. I personally advise against"
2524,"They spent a week at the Preluna Hotel. The hotel has a great location right next to the seaside promenade and close to the bus stop. The hotel staff is very nice. And so much positive information . Breakfast was a nightmare. The island is famous for its crispy bread, juicy tomatoes and sweet fruits. Meanwhile, the hotel offers clay barrettes, tomatoes from the ripening room and poor fruit. We lived in an apartment on the sixth floor and the elevator was closed for several evenings. The ants running in the apartment (the big red ones, always in the evening) filled the chalice of bitterness: (As a consolation she got a m from the cleaning lady ""Pif - paf"" for ants. . . . . . .I fought bravely, albeit with little effort."
2525,"So far I can only say that he is a very cultured man. On her first visit she noticed that she can listen to the man without interrupting in the middle of the sentence, others can't always ask questions that are of interest to them, the Doctor waits patiently for the patient to speak and then goes on to the questions that are of interest to him - - - I hope that culture goes hand in hand with knowledge."
2526,"Unfortunately, we spent New Year's Eve 2017 at the Polanica Hotel. There is no proper organization , Vodzirej Merlin do not recommend . Invitation to the New Year's Eve ball, just a simple ticket like to the movies. Eating more for the eye than for taste. None of the employees felt responsible for removing dog urine in the lobby. Obviously there is a lack of managerial staff. I'll never visit this hotel again. I'll never spend New Year's Eve or any other event if it's run by Merlin's Chief."
2527,"I wasn't satisfied. She had hyaluronic acid injected under her eyes and unfortunately, after the treatment for about a month she looked terrible because I cracked a lot of blood vessels and she looked m m as if she was heavily beaten. Perhaps there was some tendency for my blood vessels to crack, although at the previous doctor (recently moved to Warsaw) nothing like that happened. But what Dr. Rogala injected me remained in the lumps for a very long time, it did not spread evenly, so even at work she had to wear dark glasses during the whole period."
2528,"Iwona Sajór from IŻ reminded that an example of a malignant cancer, in the development of which obesity and the nutritional factors leading to it play a very important role, is breast cancer. ""It is mainly about a high intake of monosaccharides, total fats, but also saturated fats, cholesterol and at the same time low intake of dietary fiber,"" she explained. According to her, in order to reduce the risk of breast cancer, one should eat a lot of vegetables, preferably different colors. ""With vegetables we cannot exaggerate, there is no upper limit on consumption. But there is a lower limit - we should not eat less than 400 grams per day,"" said the specialist. We must also remember to include in the diet fruit, whole grain products, skimmed dairy products, fish, eggs, lean meat, and avoid processed products with high calorie content."
2529,"As PAP said, Dr. Ing. . Beata Piłat from the Faculty of Food Sciences at the University of Warsaw in Olsztyn, the sea buckthorn has not been widely known in Poland as a bush bearing very healthy fruit so far. It was and is treated mainly as an ornamental plant which can be found in parks and sea dunes. The medicinal qualities of the plant, whose orange and sometimes red fruits like corals stick to the twigs, are known in Russia and Belarus. In Russia, scientists have patented the ok . 100 different methods of using this plant. Medical literature describes the salutary properties of sea buckthorn: it increases the resistance of the human body because it is one of the few plants that has stable vitamin C in its juice compared to other fruits. As Dr. Ing. explains. Beata Pilate sea buckthorn fruit does not contain the enzyme ascorbination, which contributes to the breakdown of vitamin C . Therefore, during heat treatment, the losses of vitamin C in sea buckthorn fruit are small."

2531,"Hello. I was at one of Mrs. Beata's personal development workshops and I am delighted. There was a very nice atmosphere during the workshop. Mrs. Beata paid attention to each of us and the exercises that we had and the discussion allowed us to look at ourselves and our problem differently. In my opinion, it is worth to devote time to such workshops because the evaluation of a professional will always analyze and evaluate the matter that worries us differently and help to find a solution. In addition, objective evaluations of other people allow us to look at ourselves in a different way and draw appropriate conclusions: ) ."
2532,"The hotel is perfectly located at the foot of Jaworzyna Krynicka, walking from the mountains towards Muszyna Zlockie. The kitchen is very tasty. The swimming pool and water park are very decent, although the water is a little too warm. I was there during the heat and unfortunately the air-conditioning was not working. However, in this case you can count on a discount. Unfortunately, this will not compensate for the difficulties of staying in a stuffy, small room."
2533,"We were on vacation there with a girl and everything is okay, really. The rooms are clean, neat, elegant. Bathrooms the same - everything's OK. We were there with Groupon and everything was beautiful - even a room with a balcony we got, but . . . We had an offer with breakfast and lunch. Breakfast - you know the Swedish table - OK. Dinners - tragedy, massacre, we were there for a week and only on one day lunch was quite normal. Also, if someone is going to go there, I recommend the rooms and accommodation, but please take the offer without lunches. By meals the evaluation flies from 5 to 3."
2534,"The doctor is very polite and kind, which in my experience with doctors should be clearly stated, because it is not so obvious. He answered the questions very objectively and accurately. He presented exactly possible treatment options and honestly determined their effectiveness taking into account the medical documentation. Compared to a visit to the Oncological Hospital, where the doctor received us simply heaven and earth."
2535,"I do not recommend it - after a few months of ineffective treatment (after six months he admitted to me that he is not able to make a diagnosis), he confused me with someone else, gave me the wrong drugs, after which she felt terrible, she was not able to function, so she lost my job, she could not get over it. . . . .visits generally boil down to writing prescriptions and taking quite a bit of money for it. . . . once he accused me of medical terminology, which she did not understand at all, he said that he does not know what is wrong with me, that he is not able to recognize, he called me to another person asked for a consultation because I am a hopeless case. . . . .after that visit for a week, she didn't leave my house because she hit me so hard. . . . .you don't deal with people like that, you don't have to be a psychiatrist to know that."
2536,"She had a colonoscopy commissioned and was referred to this gentleman. . In a private office he prescribed me medication, gave a number to himself and told me what the colonoscopy was about and promised to do it on an anesthesia. . . .when the day of the procedure came and the nurse told me to dress up in my colonoscopy shorts, which I also did. She put me on the surgery table and the doctor performed a colonoscopy without an anaesthesia. . . She would rather have my parent child than relive it again. . . I was rolling away from the pain on the table and the nurse was holding me so she wouldn't run away from me. . . . .after the whole procedure the doctor patted me on the head and said that he wanted me to come to the office for medication (about 200 PLN visit). . . . .I do not recommend it. You should have informed me that I would have to pay for the anaesthesia because the National Health Fund does not refund it. . ."
2537,"The hotel in the pictures presents itself beautifully, but it is only an appearance. The food is served in a nightmarish dining room, not white and fairy tale like in the pictures. Waiters unprofessional, dirty plates on tables stand even 30 minutes. Dinners without words, you should eat breakfast: ) ""Gym"" - a broken stepper, a bicycle and a mini atlas. . . On the bedside table in the room so much dust that you can write poetry. I do not recommend ."
2539,"She wouldn't call m P . Doctor a genius. Maybe she found me on his worse day, because he answered my questions only briefly. She made an appointment for me to check that everything is ok with my first pregnancy. The gynaecological examination was quite painful. The ultrasound showed a small pregnancy bubble. She found out that it was probably a biochemical pregnancy that I would lose any day now. He ordered to do the hcg results, come up in 7 days and that's it. It literally pressed me into the chair. Cost 150 PLN . Taste remained until today ."
2540,"Location quite close to the center - on foot ok . 20 minutes - we were just fine with it. From the car park side the rooms are quiet, even though the hotel is located on one of the main streets of the city. You could see that the rooms are painted and at least partly the hotel is renovated. The downside is certainly the lack of air conditioning, which in this year's hot weather causes great discomfort, especially if the room is on the 6th floor. Breakfast is fine - you can surely find something for yourself."

2542,"A great doctor, nice and friendly, devotes a lot of time to the patient (first visit about an hour), explains everything perfectly and answers every question. After half a year of treatment, the results are close to perfect as well as my mood.

The U.S. could regain 17% of the global tourism market share by 2020 and create 1.3 million new hotel and tourism jobs if a visa reform is introduced to facilitate the arrival of foreign tourists, according to a report prepared by the U.S. Travel and Tourism Industries : A Year in Reviev 2010. S . Travel Association . USA Despite the revenues which indicate the post-crisis rebound of the market, the tourism industry lost 112 thousand jobs in 2010. This was the third year in a row when employment in the tourism sector was decreasing. Since 2007, the number of jobs in tourism has decreased by almost 1.1 million and this decrease turned out to be higher than in three consecutive years after the events of 11 September 2001. These reductions have affected the accommodation sector the least - in the last year. These reductions affect the accommodation sector the least - last year, employment in hotels and other facilities operating in the U.S. decreased by 13,000. This is less than 1% of the employment in hotels and other facilities operating in the US."
2544,"I went to see your doctor because of a long, suffocating cough. The doctor listened to me and looked into my throat and found a slight murmur on the larynx and a slightly reddened throat. He prescribed me an anti-inflammatory medication and recommended that I inhale saline. The second day after the visit the cough didn't go away so I went to an ENT specialist who found that I had purulent laryngitis and abscesses on my tonsils which I will probably have to remove surgically, prescribed me a strong antibiotic, syrup and throat wash. He also forbade inhalation because it could cause pneumonia. My experience with Dr. Frost isn't the best, even though he kindly threw 'em in the mud 150 PLN."
2545,"Already on the phone I felt the concreteness, but also kindness. Only in May I will be able to be with my fiancée, but I will go, although it is 200km from us. I was calling the doctors from the very top of the ranking, but it was only at Dr. Iwona Wojniak that I stopped them, because the conversation on the phone encouraged me for the first time. This is only the beginning, but I am encouraged. Additionally, the opinion after reading the doctor's wise advice on the forum on the internet made me feel good."
2546,"The location is very pleasant, by the Spa Park. We had a room with a balcony from which there was a view of the Spa Pond - beautiful mornings. The room was spacious, clean, the bathroom was also without reservations. A very comfortable bed. Quiet, quiet, and the biggest attractions are within walking distance - and a water pump room, and a skull chapel. Equipped with fridge, kettle, cups, cutlery - such a basic set. We were also very pleasantly surprised, because there were no problems with much earlier check-in: ) : ) : )"

The first circle was not hard to find out how much more I would have sat over the anal one, and probably I would have passed it. But with the evaluation is terrible, you have a task or not, which is the scale of points. It's easy to get points at the board, but it doesn't take much, because during the exercises we always had to repeat the lecture and when we did 3 tasks for 2 hours it was really good. In the nature of things, we did 1 task once and it wasn't quite for the whole 2 hours of 8) . The second circle of similar difficulty as the first one. I got 'em to this gentleman after the basic exam when in one task at the very end of the result instead of + was - and gave me 0 points for the whole task.

And that's why he sent me to the amendment. And that one was 8) because someone else was checking it. There were 5 people in wheels and 1 on the basic exam.

The second pregnancy entrusted me to Mr. Szewczuk, it started with hemorrhages on the uterus and ended with a very rare fetal position - a transverse one. The doctor was very good at everything, he didn't wrap up, he didn't sweeten, he didn't sugarcoat, he did what a professional should do, he kept the pregnancy, he ran it, he solved the caesarean section in due time without causing any complications. I recommend from the bottom of my heart, he's a great doctor and also, cool, nice and cheerful, guy and for that a huge plus. Greetings to B. Bukowska"
2549,"We spent a fantastic family holiday in a tree house in the Charlotte Valley. The cottages are spacious and well decorated with taste. All around is silence, charming greenery and grazing behind the fence of the neighbouring Capybara Zoo (such a big rodent). A place attractive for children. The food is excellent. Beautiful SPA and swimming pool . Additional ZOO attractions, horses, to the beach in Ustka 15 - 20 minutes by car. The staff of the resort is very helpful. Small problems: from the cottages to the main hotel building (for meals) is quite far away, the resort area could be better cleaned, the cottages were not cleaned during our stay. The cottages are of different sizes, if you are travelling with a family of 4 people, ask for the cottages: 2, 3, 4."
2550,"Generally not so good. Arrived em for the weekend because there were no places in Gołębiewski and I am very disappointed although I thought that Gołębiewski is already old . The price was similar to what I pay in Gołębiewski . Therefore, I compare with Gołębiewski . Aqua park already needs renovation and is generally not too interesting . At the level of Gołębiewski is a shack . There is nowhere to teach the child to swim - in Gołębiewski is a lot of places to do it . I was chased out of the pool because the child is not swimming very well - he can only be in the pool if he can swim 25 m . - It is not allowed to learn even with a board under the care of a parent. Another child was chased out of the pool with the parent and the pool was empty and the ladies of the lifeguards could gossip further. There is no other place to learn to swim. Very monotonous food at Gołębiewski level is a school canteen. For a person who does not eat meat there is nothing. The bathroom smells of food from the kitchen and the smell spreads to the whole room. Positives: Location near the center. Wifi works well. The decor of the room is fine - I had an apartment because there were no ordinary rooms. I don't know if the usual ones are also at this level. Nice quiet room."
2551,"Our plane was late, we arrived at 10 p.m., the hotel did not provide us with a meal, which we lost through no fault of our own. It was not enough, we could barely get along in English. The room smelled like a stink, the humidity, the air-conditioning practically didn't work, in the other room rented by our parents the TV set and fridge didn't work. Ants on the floor, cockroaches on the parents' side. Tragic interior and fungus. In my opinion such finished rooms do not deserve even 3 stars. Medium food . I was counting on eating some good fish, and here only herring and mostly beef. Alcohol is not much to choose from, ice cream only on the beach for 1 - 1, 5h and only 2 flavors. The pool's cool, but hard about the place. After breakfast there is practically no longer any chance of any place. The rooms are cleaned, but superficially. Some sockets do not work, tiny TV set. For starters 2 small water from the fridge. Most Russians and Turks. Generally unlucky we hit the road, I do not recommend : )"
2552,"The location is a clear advantage of the hotel. At the beach itself, a wonderful view of the sea from the bar on the 6th floor and in our case only from there. The superior family room turned out to be a dark and cold (though clean) room with a view of the building, which provided us with an annoying wake-up call every day at 7am. On booking.com there is not a word about this nuisance - so be careful . The reception desk seems to have understood the problem, but in fact it did nothing but ""gesture"" to offer us parking for free. The service is generally friendly and kind, although there are some unpleasant exceptions: both at the reception desk and in the restaurant. In my opinion the standard of service is definitely below 5 stars. Frequent comments about the crowd in the main restaurant turned out to be unjustified. There was always a lot of space in the additional open room. Breakfast is quite tasty and varied. The a ' la carte restaurant turned out to be a failure: the time waiting for any dish was over an hour ( ! ) . It is said that it is connected with the reduced composition of the kitchen in the low season (seriously ? May weekend is low season for the hotel ?) Swimming pools, SPA area according to the description. Tidy, clean - although without any frenzy. Ordered treatment was cancelled two hours in advance. The general impression: the hotel is ok, although from 5 stars you just expect more."
2553,"The earlier the cancer is detected, the greater the chance of a cure, which in oncology means at least 5 years of survival without a relapse. As Michał Siwik reminds us, endoscopic examination of the large intestine, i.e. colonoscopy is free of charge and available for every person after 55. The colonoscopy is free of charge and available for every person over 55 years of age within the framework of the screening programme. Patients receive invitations to examinations which allow them to detect cancer at an early stage. Each of us has a chance to reduce the risk of cancer. During the examination pre-cancer lesions, i.e. polyps, are already detected. Patients who come to the doctor's office only with full-blown colorectal cancer are in a very difficult situation. Nevertheless, even in these cases the most modern medical and therapeutic procedures are used, which extend the life of a patient with the cancer. ""Every year patients have access to more and more modern treatment, be it chemotherapy or surgical methods. People with generalised colorectal cancer, i.e. those who have already metastasized to the liver, have access to new drugs, targeted at specific molecular targets. Last year the Ministry of Health decided that drugs that were only available in the third line of treatment were transferred to the first line of treatment,"" says Siwik ."

When I got to the hospital during my pregnancy with problems, he would come and keep an eye on all the tests and results, even though she was not his private patient. I regret very much that I did not manage to give birth with Mr. Doctor (first the renovation of the midwifery and then the liquidation: () It is a doctor who does not stress, introduces a calm atmosphere during the examination and a really kind person. Thanks to him she also found me a brilliant ultrasound specialist Dr Dudarewicz"
2557,"Before Christmas, Dr. Gresse performed breast enlargement surgery on me. The consultation before the operation was full of professionalism, the doctor explained everything to me in detail, he chose an implant that fits my figure perfectly. And when it comes to the procedure itself and my mood afterwards, I can also write about it in superlatives. Already for 3 days, I did not have to take painkillers, the swelling came out of my chest after the day. This is an evidence of experience in performing such operations by your doctor. I personally recommend it. If she would ever decide to have any surgery or plastic surgery, she would surely choose Dr. Gresse."
2558,"Dr. Adam Świda Course : Company economics I recommend [ / b ] RECOMMENDATION For your attendance : D nothing to do you can read a newspaper or a book : D The guest is 30 years old so spox : D He reads the list so you will not sign up for the overdue attendance . He once let us know the list, but then he said that he will continue to read it because it was so much faster (it's not surprising that people wrote down their attendance earlier or even in reserve : D hehehe ) He had 3 absences out of 10 probably and gave me 4.5 You can get along with him or bring him a release : D RECOGNISES : D"
2559,"A very kind and cordial doctor who listens well to the patient's problems and tries to understand them and advise accordingly. After prescribing medications which of course can improve the state of well-being, you have to face the problems and try to solve them yourself or with the help of a psychologist."
2560,"They got 'em a room in the basement where it was damp, stinky and the internet broke down. Breakfast at the sisters' place is terrible, buns inflated with air, jams like from a motel on the highway and old weathered breakfast muesli that lie from the unknown when in a big bowl with nothing covered. For all this, the sisters were not very nice to me. My experience of staying overnight in nuns has always been very positive, but this time I was as disappointed as possible. When I asked 'em if I could leave my computer at the porter's office because I had to send a large file to my employer, you answered that you wouldn't help me anymore, and before that all you did was graciously print out your train ticket. To make sure that there wasn't enough of this, you didn't give me the rest by ""mistake"" with absolute premeditation of which I am convinced. She will not give up the nuns, only this one is extremely disgusting."
2561,"The doctor was supposed to improve root canal treatment after another dentist who could not find the third root (without a microscope). After an hour of work under the microscope she also did not find, she said that the tooth is to be torn out because it has curved roots (in the description of the clinic on Batory is the treatment of curved roots) and that from tomorrow no longer works here (the clinic on Batory) so goodbye - and for this valuable advice paid m 700 zł (600 unsuccessful root search and 100 consultation previously) . I envy other satisfied patients. . especially the doctor's commitment. She would have given me a failure in root canal treatment - but why did she take a difficult case in the last moments of her work? ? ?"
2562,"New strategies for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of bacterial diseases are a huge block of tasks involving seven research groups. The mechanisms of replication and segregation of bacterial chromosomes are discovered by prof . dr hab . Jolanta Zakrzewska - Czerwińska . Dr Wiesław Świętnicki fights against pathogenic E . coli, new vaccine preparations are developed by prof . Czesław Ługowski . Whereas prof . dr hab . Maciej Zabel develops a method of binding antibodies to a nanodetector capturing rare cells in blood . The prevention and treatment of periodontal diseases is being worked on by dr hab . Teresa Olczak , diagnostics and prevention of bacterial diseases is dealt with by prof . dr hab . Andrzej Gamian . Cancer diseases are the area of interest of prof . dr hab . Piotr Dzięgiel . The group dealt, among others, with research on breast cancer. The scientists were looking for markers, i.e. substances secreted e.g. to blood, which would allow to recognize the presence and course of the neoplastic process. The team was very successful. We managed to develop a simple diagnostic test with the use of material from a thin-needle biopsy of a breast tumor. The test can indicate to oncologists what type of cancer they are dealing with, whether it is benign or malignant, how to plan the surgery and further therapeutic treatment. The scientist has also established cooperation with a diagnostic company, which is interested in developing a test for early detection of breast cancer."
2563,"Quick visit, express diagnosis only price 10min 160 PLN. Doctor ok . I subtract a star for the cost . If it wasn't for an urgent matter it would be undecided to pay a visit . I will write only that if a man has no money he may become a cripple or even get rid of life by state institutions (NFZ) . A man pays his contributions and nothing can benefit from it."
2564,"I recommend very much, even though he did not cope with my son's skin problem (a very heavy form of AD), he did not leave us ""On ice"" he directed further to a specialist friend of his and made sure that the son was accepted by him for a visit. . . I recommend it with all my heart! ! ! ! ! !"
2565,"I've been going to Dr. Baron's for about. 17tc . Earlier I went to Mr. Barczak (1 visit), where the doctor, despite the information that I had earlier bleeding the day before, did not perform ultrasound and to Dr. Baron. Feliksik, who for the visit cancelled almost 200zl. I think he was a good doctor, but after the visit to the Baron I find that you can still meet a good doctor at the National Health Fund who will explain. One of the more delicate gynaecologists I had. This is the first pregnancy, I am 20 years old. Even though I vomited up to 22tc, a few visits to the hospital, everything is fine. I don't have to worry about anything, the baby did his first act on time, he lives 2 / 12 / 13, that is in 19tc. I don't have to take vitamin because my body rejects it, a good diet is enough and you don't have to stuff yourself with chemicals: ) Dr. Baron commented negatively on the previous doctor, I did not have prenatal tests and anatomy of the fetus, unfortunately it was too late, but he gave a referral and wanted to do everything to push me into free time, failed, but I appreciate the effort, it is nice when the doctor gets involved with each patient individually. The receiving lady, nice, before the visit does a thorough blood pressure measurement, this is recorded on the pregnancy card, additionally they do the echo of the baby's heart on professional equipment. As for the equipment in the office - professional, good and new equipment. The only reservation is the bathroom for patients, but hygiene is taken care of at home.) I recommend this doctor, even though a few years back I was very skeptical about him. I changed my mind. Greetings, Alicia Krzyżostaniak (patient)"
2566,"IT 1 wasn't bad in general, what we did at the exercise we could practice at home - maybe it wasn't an easy subject, that's why the ways to write down the code written at home were different. You could use books - this is a source of additional knowledge: ) there were some cards - but not so difficult. when accepting the project he asked about everything - you had to know what it was about. In the end, however, it turned out to be very good - the credit program was relaxed and the grades were very high. He said that he was doing this (""dock"")."
2567,"One of the worst hotels in which I've slept in, the room is a clinic, it looked completely different than in the pictures. The walls were dirty, the carpet from the People's Republic of Poland, the seats were some kind of massacre, they had that twenty years. In the restaurant 4 waitresses could not handle five tables. I waited 40 minutes for a tartar. The pool is 8x3 meters. In the jacuzzi you can do laundry, there is so much chlorine. Value for money - a disaster. I won't go back there again."
2568,"A very factual physician, he explained the findings of the service check-up, which he performed during the paid visit. He conducted a thorough interview with regard to his health condition. I do not know how effective it is because the examination showed that I have nothing to worry about. So I don't have to continue to treat myself."
2569,"A very good doctor, advised me on glasses with different parameters than I always had and finally I can see well. I had to switch to new glasses a bit, but it's ok. In the optics next to the office there is a large selection of frames, average prices, average as in Kielce."
2570,"A family-run hotel where the staff do their best to make sure the guests have a good time. Breakfast of 5 euros is worth a try, although it may not be very varied. During the 1-week stay with 2 times the cleaning of the bathroom failed - the shower poured water outside the curtain, had to be wiped, and the staff removed the rug and did not bring a new one. . . In general, ok ."
2571,"The Gardena Powermax 37E mower seems to be a good choice, it has corrected all the revealed defects of the 36E model. But I find that the working width of the knife on this mower (37cm) is designed to contact the width of the housing. And yet, you mow in different conditions and the housing works like a car body - in total, the knife cuts the housing from the inside (at least in my copy) . Nothing big, but in a mower aspiring to a high level of workmanship and design it is a significant drawback."
2572,"The Parador also offers services not found anywhere else, such as a free breakfast for pilgrims wandering to the tomb of St. James the Apostle... After all, this building used to be a hotel - a hospital for hikers finishing the many kilometres of trail leading to Santiago. According to the rule in force at the time, every pilgrim could stay here for three days and was entitled to three meals. By taking over the hotel as a chain, they decided to continue this beautiful tradition, which they announced on the day of its inauguration, July 23, 1954. And so, every day the first 10 pilgrims get free breakfast ""overlooking the cathedral"". How are they chosen? They must have a Compostela, which is a certificate confirming the pilgrimage (only those who have travelled at least 100 km on foot or at least 200 km by bicycle or horseback can receive it; the Parador in Santiago is your No. 1?"
2573,"Under the motto Euro 2012, the 5th Hoteliers' Ball was held under the patronage of the Małopolska Hotel Chamber Gremium in the Leopolis Hotel in Kraków. Participants of the ball were dressed in evening clothes with accessories symbolizing ""sport struggle"". Many of them had flags painted on their faces, interesting and funny hats and fan scarves on their heads. Some of the ladies, very fancy, dressed up as cheerleaders! The Ballroom was decorated in the colors white and red, also the restaurant staff had accessories in national colors. During this evening the dishes served were round in shape, which also symbolized the ball."
2574,"I have already had three visits with the doctor, all three were delayed - 30 min, 45 min and again 30 min today - as for me it means disrespect for the patient. Embarrassing. The visit itself, as usual, was nice but again it turned out that I will ""die"" - the results of TSH are going in the right direction (I suffer from Hashimoto) but today it suddenly turned out that I have a tendency to diabetes. Before my second visit I was supposed to do a glucose and insulin test, which of course the doctor didn't even ask me and today she fired that glucose too high. And suddenly she started asking about my weight and unsuccessfully looked for how much it weighed me at the first visit - then she didn't even ask me about it and now it turns out to be an important factor. And it turned out that I probably have too low a level of vitamin D - also on the basis of blood morphology, the results of which are almost unchanged from several studies. As for me, the doctor searches my patients for new ailments every once in a while in order to have a basis for the next visits. I sincerely advise you to look for another endocrinologist - if only because of the notoriously late doctor!"
2575,"In Poland, there is a standard for going to a restaurant. Unfortunately, Dwor Kresowy adds invaluable contribution to this culture. It starts with the fact that instead of waiting everywhere for a card and so on you have to press the button, no information. Then the staff mistook the dishes, brought spilled soups, trampled on their feet. Of course, no apologies. The best was at the end. With a gentle remark to the manager (or perhaps the owner - she wasn't very kind to introduce herself), the investigation literally began, questioning a colleague with whom I was on the order. Is this a standard of customer service? Maybe it is about the continuation of the traditions of the USSR, and finally the end of this country and this culture of customer service. It's just a wonder that there's already a highway next door and no one will want to go down to this restaurant any time because of the sweat."
2577,"beautiful and recommendable place, peace and quiet, cleanliness and elegance, a great place for families with small children, helpful and friendly staff, good food, the possibility of renting a reverser is a great proposition for those who appreciate peace and active recreation, SUPER PLACE WORKSHOOD RECOMMENDATIONS"
2578,"I didn't like the visit very much, especially when compared to the positive opinions she found here. First of all, you enter the office directly from the corridor, from which you can perfectly hear what is going on inside. And everyone can enter the corridor from the street. This does not seem particularly comfortable to me. Secondly, I have not encountered any courtesy, sincerity, commitment or professionalism. Mrs. Bogacz was rather passive, she didn't have much to say except in general terms. She was not nice. Generally, she felt sharply floated. It was a bit sad when somebody came in and choked really hard things out of herself. I would definitely not recommend it."
2579,"A large proportion of young people still avoid physical activity. ""Only a slight improvement after Poland's accession to the European Union can be seen. At present, only about 30% of boys and 20% of girls are physically active enough. The activity of both sexes is clearly declining with age,"" pointed out Prof. Brown. Fijałkowska . The number of children with unhealthy diet is increasing . Scientists estimated that unhealthy dietary choices (e.g. chips, fizzy drinks, fast food) are currently made by 21% of children aged 11-12 years, 28% of children aged 13-14 years and 33%. 15-16 year-olds . Although the prevalence of smoking is decreasing among 15-16 year olds, it is gradually increasing among younger children, especially girls . ""This is a serious problem and a big challenge for all of us"", Professor Warmus was concerned. Piotr Jankowski, Chairman of the Health Promotion Committee of the Polish Cardiac Society."
2580,"After the first visit I give you a good grade. For a good approach to the child (the little one was willing to be examined), for a good interview, for listening to problems and giving advice (and not, as with other doctors, being wise and criticising the parents' conduct). Good, because we have a preliminary diagnosis so far and we are testing drugs. A bit expensive visit - 200 PLN . But it is worth spending it for the child's health."
2581,"The hotel's pretty cool. Very nice and stylish decoration . Rooms without additional things that are in hotels 4 * standard i.e. shampoo, slippers. Lack of bathrobe in a spa hotel where you have to go to the pool is something incomprehensible. Hotel clean and cozy rooms. The food is very good, but the service is very low. Incompetent waiters. When asked why she was the only one who didn't get a meal despite everyone having already eaten, he answered "" . . ""No kitchen what I can"". The bartender didn't want to fulfill the simplest request. The hotel has potential, but by the service is unused."
2582,"I highly recommend all women to contact this doctor. He received me in the Bielany hospital for the first delivery by CC and I was very impressed by all his care from the moment I was admitted to the ward until I left the hospital with my tiny daughter. I was surrounded by an attraction only in private institutions, he was committed, caring, very communicative, he answered calmly and thoroughly to all questions, he warned me about what was going to happen, what tests were going to be done, how long it would take, what they were used for, when the birth would take place, what it would look like step by step. He visited me after the birth, he was interested in my and the baby's well-being. Just a real doctor - a professional - friend, not just a medical craftsman. Personal culture fantastic. At the next pregnancy I'm sure I'll trust this doctor."
2583,"The hotel is located close to the center of the resort, on an interesting hill, the rooms are large and spacious, clean, with a beautiful view of the sea and Albania, you can go upstairs on foot or wait for the hotel shuttle bus which will take you to the rooms. The food is very tasty and varied, there is something for everyone. The only thing that's going to happen is that the internet is supposed to be at the reception, but it's working terribly well at all you can't connect at all."
2584,"He used em a few of these types of clamps for home use. Wolfcraft, Topex and all are bad and this Stanley is the worst. I'm currently looking for another. It's a shame the money soon broke down. Generally, they all have a similar disadvantage - the pin is made pretty fast, then the clamp screw is processed and the squeeze stops holding. Some solution would be to weld something at the end of this bolt or to thread the end and tighten the nut [ I chose em variant 2 ] . Generally, I do not recommend the damage and nerves and money ."
2585,"Unfortunately, in my case, the terms ""factual"" and ""concrete"" are negatives. She has received a number of advice and recommendations for breastfeeding - or rather not breastfeeding, which she did not ask me to do. This advice, very emotionally expressed, has nothing to do with the current medical knowledge, the WHO recommendations. I don't know how in today's times of easy access to knowledge, training, improvement of doctors one can talk such nonsense, based, in my case, on nothing, because the monologue started as soon as she said to me that I am breastfeeding - BEFORE the study. The results of the study I have b . good - which was not even asked about. It was assumed in advance that my body is a ruin (on the contrary). Also, we have, which are breastfeeding and do not want to be overwhelmed by intimidating comments, not only the mp itself but also the physicality (figures, breasts) should choose another doctor."
2586,"The test starts with a short fairy tale shown on the screen to focus the child's attention on the monitor. Later on, it presents the right stimuli, i.e. faces, each for one second, followed by images in different parts of the screen. ""Everything lasts a total of 3 or 5 minutes, but for such a toddler it is a lot of time anyway"" - stresses the PAP interlocutor. Eye movements of a child's eyes are automatically recorded by an eye tracker, i.e. a monitor with a built-in motion sensor and a camera. Thanks to that scientists can measure very precisely how long babies look at the face, how long they look at a given picture, how quickly they transfer their eyesight from their face to another object appearing on the monitor."
2587,"Very spacious apartments at a good price. Very clean . Super contact with the owner . Kitchen equipment just right for preparing a meal . When we entered the terrace, a great view emerged in front of us, a panorama of the sea towards Kathisma beach - what beautiful sunsets. . . . .ah, SUPER. There was a piece to the town but still the location of the apartment was just right for exploring the island."
2588,"As the best holiday I've had Very nice staff, waiters, bartenders, in the hotel clean and tidy, I'm sure I'll come for next year's food as very good to me (I think everyone will find something for themselves) (as long as they don't give enough pizza because it's very delicious) greetings New Year's Eve."
2589,"Very good location for skiing in Ischgl, a hotel in a quiet, secluded place you can sleep with windows open and at night nobody will wake us up. The rooms are clean, cleaned daily. The hotel is alpine, but with a hidden modernity. Very good sauna center, there is also a small swimming pool, but with a water whip. Breakfast efforts very rich, dinner meals are in modern style. Sometimes too much - served on fancy plates, boards, stones, spoons, containers. Eating dinner can take up to 2 hours. The offer includes afternoon snacks from 15. 00 - 17 . 00 . Very nice and professional service."
2590,Why are there so many jobs to be created by the Hilton? This is the Hilton's estimate of the hotels being built under franchise and management contracts. The starting point is the ratio: a team member for one available room in existing facilities (managed or franchised) taking into account the specifics of the region. The new and converted facilities have been split to show the number of new jobs and jobs to be maintained by rebranding the facilities to Hilton Worldwide. Source: Hilton Worldwide Photo: Finishing works in one of the Hilton Worldwide facilities.
2591,Hotel and service super . Food varied . We recommend tours with a guide Bozen is great . Animations interesting and daily something different . The bartenders nice do not regret alcohol . Ground staff speaks Polish . I recommend hotel and travel agency TUI . Next trip I will definitely use TUI services.
2592,"The more so as Gdynia is one of those cities where hotel business is not easy and investments in accommodation facilities are more risky than in Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw and even the Tri-City (Gdansk and Sopot), which is co-creating with Gdynia. Most tourists visit Gdynia for a few hours and stay overnight either in other cities forming the Tricity or in facilities located outside large urban centres in Puck County. Also business travelers ""come"" to the city, do business and ... go away."
2593,"Sports psychologists recommend so-called imaginative training. You can try to run the entire marathon route in your mind, taking into account the established strategy and involving as many senses as possible. ""Sit down in a quiet place, close your eyes and imagine how you run the whole route kilometer by kilometer. Take into account as many details as possible, including what you see on the route or on the face of a sports watch, but also observe various noises such as your heartbeat, the cheering of your fans, monitor your own well-being, taste the food and drink you eat and test ways of dealing with emergencies. Before you stand on the starting line, you will be prepared for various eventualities. It is worth sticking to this plan, because euphoria during the first kilometers can make the pace of the run much faster than intended, which in subsequent stages will pay off with a drop in form and motivation"" - experts advise."
2594,"I support you with the comment below. It's 100 percent correct. I had exactly the same situation: all in a hurry and without any diagnosis I was given medication for 45 days (which reasonable doctor gives medication for such a period without any tests? ) for almost 200 zloty, which, as it turned out, did not help, I felt even worse after them. I have to say that I have not only paid 150 PLN + 200 PLN for a 5-minute visit, but I am still tired of my intestines. The office looked like a family doctor, that is a desk and bed nothing else. I advise against all this lady ."
2595,"I think Dr. is good at setting up, etc. But since he's been using shock waves, he's just pushing people and he's been using almost everything. And the price for the shock waves is really high. Somewhere else in Wroclaw you can use it really cheaply. I really recommend it, but don't let it get pulled over."
2596,". . .A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENT. SOMEHOW NOT WORTH THE PRICE ! It was very dirty in the hotel, the 3 rooms that we booked were not cleaned at all, a thick layer of dust on the tables, lamps, cobwebs with spiders on the ceilings and on the bedside tables, dirty stained carpets. In one of the rooms there is no air conditioning and in the other one there is a lock. The large breakfast room has a buffet plate with chopped orange, grapefruit and 1 kiwi. . . . zenada . Dinner is 50 zloty per person, served cold, dripping with fat. Service on a terrible level. The manager, after hearing the complaint, did not even apologize, but asked: 'Well, what do you expect from me? ! ! ""and what do you expect me to do?!!!"" No customer service procedure. I usually paid compensation. At the time of the check-out, the whole amount of money was counted impertinently, and the attempt to talk to the manager again ended with the statement that she was not in the hotel. The owner of the hotel, even in the pictures, suddenly stated that he is not the owner! ! ! I have made a written complaint at the reception desk. The receptionist assured me that the manager will call you back. A week went by, and then no one called back or responded to the complaints. . . . . .the hotel has nothing to do with the 4-star hotel. I warn you about the quality of the service and the standard of this establishment."
2597,"Dirty bathroom, mushroom, cockroaches, dirty bedding, walls, bruna bedding floor lack of cleaning after reporting a dirty room lady with service came and washed the toilets with a towel for hotel guests, dirty corridors probably never cleaned the elevator I leave without a comment yet such something never saw m , swimming pool tiles cracked in some places lack of leg cut with a meeting with such a pool making Eating a cook is not Greek no Greek can every day the same rice bread and eggs lack of snacks lack of drinks promised ice cream only beer in plastic during meals of the queue because there were no plates and cutlery on account of the eye saw me kitchens and the sanitarium should close it we ate somewhere else like the others PLAZA not cleaned up there is no possibility to compose the bottom there It is not safe for everyone if you want to compliment each other you have to go to the beaches of other hotels GREGOS mess this company is not an agreement the lack of our reservations no help from the resident has seen admitted that they have a problem with them and went zero help do not care about their customers today I report the case to the court along with all the participants I point out all those who were there are outraged that the Greek sent us to this hotel as the previous holiday that left . Do not buy a trip to this hotel"
2598,"I consider the visit to the doctor very positive, because at last I see the light of hope for the improvement of my condition. The doctor seems to be a very helpful man who wants to improve the patient's condition as much as possible. He immediately took up the modification of the pharmacological side of treatment. If she were to speak about the downsides, it is only that the doctor does not deal with the therapy, which in the description of his competence is very confusing. For the first visit she went with the idea of starting the therapy and here unfortunately I was disappointed. Besides, I really hope that this doctor will really help me."
2599,"She was at Dr. Słopień's and I don't generally judge him badly or well. Standard. I wasn't impressed, the visit was quite short and not very detailed. Dr. very kind, but as I say, I don't know if she would have decided to choose Mr. S³opien as a permanent doctor. One time - no problem."
2600,"Worst 3-star hotel I've ever been in. The only advantages of this hotel are the nice ladies at the reception, cleanliness and great bartender Toni. The rest is some drama. The food was a nightmare adapted only for the English guests. All the dishes prepared with powdered cubes, etc. about the monotony of the food not to mention ! Throughout our stay, my diet was based on bouillons and fries because every dish was either salted or over-salted. But that's not the end of the story, the cleaning ladies during our cosmos were tearing out the plates from under our noses without saying a word about whether we're done. If we've sat too long, we've cursed under our noses in Spanish. There was also a situation when a lady with a refuse cart stood at our table and started throwing leftovers from other plates with us. I don't have to add that such an attraction automatically reduces your appetite while you're eating. . . And finally the cherry on the cake or bartender Michael brazenly consuming gume with ham hamish pronouns and comments about our origin! To sum up, if you don't want to ruin your holiday, go to another hotel! ! ! ! !"
2601,I was on two visits to Mr. Wiśnowski and unfortunately he did not help me. Poor interest in my problem. During the visit I had more ideas about what could cause my ailments and how to treat them than the doctor himself. I personally see no reason to be delighted with his person.
2602,"The building offers 53 rooms, a conference room, a restaurant and underground parking. According to the announcement, hotels in Gdańsk, Łeba and Samotwór near Wrocław will start operating this year under the name Best Western. ""This year we have already signed agreements with five hotels, four of which will start operating under the Best Western brand in autumn. This way our offer will be enriched with nearly 200 rooms. And this is not the end yet. We plan to close the year 2012 with at least 20 hotels. , says Gheorghe Marian Cristescu , Regional Sales Director of Best Western for Poland . During the first half of the year Best Western chain joined one hotel in Poland (Best Western Poleczki) with 24 rooms, thus reaching the state of 12 facilities offering a total of 1288 rooms."
2603,"I am very pleased with the visit, but I give four stars because I have not finished my treatment but I am just starting and I do not know what the results will be. Doctor is very nice, she is interested in the patient, devotes as much time as necessary, asks questions and suggests her conclusions (accurate), very carefully checks the topic of treatment and suggests interesting things, it is hard to meet such a nice doctor, but she also gives four stars because of the lasers she did not know much about m and I do not know if it is safe and what are the contraindications."
2604,"I am once again in this hotel and you can see that the hotel saves on guests in terms of room equipment. I have had the best room booked and standard was missing a second pair of slippers, a bathrobe. Mineral water for the second day also not replenished. No razor, no toothbrush. Only after the phone call the missing things were reported. The location of the hotel is great. The view of PKiN is beautiful, especially at night. Nice wrestling and sauna. Breakfast is good and varied. Service as always nice, smiling and helpful. Despite the savings on guests I recommend this hotel to everyone staying in the capital."
2605,"Advantages: the hotel is located right on the sea shore, renovated, good food, indoor pool, health treatments, well maintained green area, elevator. The rooms have deck chairs, windshield, TV, hairdryer, towels, fridge, bathrobes (at the reception). I recommend rooms with sea views, on the 1st floor, on the large terrace. In the afternoon, you can sunbathe on them and contemplate the views, such as sunset. Disadvantages: the room was not cleaned even once for 7 days, the terrace was very dirty! ! ! and it seemed to have been cleaned since last season. The door to the terrace did not close. Expensive parking and unguarded."
2606,"The hotel has only double rooms, so called family suite is a room with beds in the corridor during our stay many people from different travel agencies advertised these rooms because they expected two separate rooms and not one separated by folding doors, no beach and access to the sea, very good food, and unfortunately, hopeless wi - fi should be assumed that it generally does not exist. A good thing is the adult zone."
2608,"The doctor treats a person close to me and I have a positive opinion about him - he has performed the operation on the stomach, he is competent, responsible, quite nice. We go to him for check-ups, already 3 years. Sorry to read the comments that he is conceited, etc . Dear predecessor, if FREQUENCY you feel that he is so bad, it means that you still go to him. Why? Or maybe you trust him? . . . . . . . . . ...or maybe you're jealous of him. . . . . ...mate?"
2609,"The quality of this hotel is evidenced by the fact that to get here I have to travel almost 5000 kilometres. I've been here all seasons. He used to spend time here with his family, friends, he was at a business meeting and he used to play at New Year's Eve balls. Every time it was special. And this time he didn't disappoint 'em. For those who have not yet arrived here, some important information. Great location with a fantastic view, close to the ski lift to Jaworzyna (important in winter - skiing), super-clean rooms with extra evening service, restaurant with breakfasts which are hard to get out of (homemade cold cuts and bread), A bar with a cigar smoking room and alcohols from all over the world (I recommend a compilation of Japanese whiskey and a good cigar), a spa center with a swimming pool from which you can admire skiers on the slope and a cosmetic institute with a top-level sewing. All this is important, but the uniqueness of this place is the people employed here are fully professional and friendly. They have visited many high-class hotels around the world, but the service offered by pesonel Erisa is second to none. I envy the owners."
2610,"Nice hotel, although by the main road, but she didn't hear any cars. At any time you can eat soup of the day and drink coffee, chocolate or tea for free. Clean, friendly, nice. You can come with your pet. Admittedly, the rooms could be larger, but as for a weekend outing or a stopover on the road and that at a low price (75zł per night on New Year's Eve) is great."
2612,"Well, visits over the years have come to nothing. Dr. Sankowski was making up another misdiagnosis. Unfortunately, he didn't come up with the idea that my problems could be rheumatic. He also did not diagnose joint hypermobility - one of the reasons for my fatal cartilage condition. Another doctor was able to find it after just one visit. Generally - I do not recommend . The doctor is nice, but I think it is the least important in the treatment process."
2613,"The doctor appreciates the silence during the visit. When she watches the results of the tests, she does not comment on them, she writes down various things in the patient's file. When the patient has any questions, he just listens to them and does not necessarily answer them. The doctor shouted at me that I only came to her when she was 5 m pregnant. The strangest thing was that the results of the hormone test were as normal as possible. I had the impression that the doctor was trying to ""find something"", but I don't know for what purpose. I won't go to that doctor again."
2614,"I had a chance to see the doctor because of the constant coughing as a legacy of the cold. She seemed to me to be a very factual and competent person, she prescribed my treatment and had me examined to make sure it was not something more serious. However, the next day she was at another internist's for consultation on the results of the tests she had ordered. It turned out that the treatment the doctor prescribed for me, namely cough syrup, is not necessary and I should not even use it because I am pregnant (which she informed me about immediately and which is also visible) and it has quite a strong effect and is used, among others, in pneumonia. Unfortunately, I have already managed to buy it and it was also quite expensive, so basically I spent my money on a medicine which I cannot use and additionally I have to buy another one prescribed by another doctor. This time it is completely safe for me and my child. My comment is neutral because she did not have enough contact with the doctor to give a fair assessment. Although I am a little disappointed with the whole situation, the visit to the doctor's office took place in a nice atmosphere."
2615,"I can fully sign this comment with my name: ""This was my first visit. The office looks well equipped, the visit took place on time and lasted a whole 30 minutes. The examination as for me detailed - both the patient interview and the examination itself. My problem is the throat, the doctor also looked in detail at the nose and ears. He made a preliminary diagnosis, had additional examinations done, explain everything. The patient gets a printout with all the information - both the potential causes of the disease and a description of what tests to do, how to take the drugs. You can see that the doctor is looking for the cause and is not going to only alleviate the symptoms or cure ""blindly"". This is what I expect from a good doctor. Also this was my first visit, but I am satisfied with it. """
2616,"Shatkowski Jan, PhD Physics h 2 can be [ / b ] at the end there is a text, issues in a - 0 + to read his lectures it's not gonna be like that in my case. he likes to experiment so it is different with these giants I have been trying to get through to a small number of people not knowing H 2 lectures are boring no need to walk"
2617,"We've been with my husband twice. It was always great. All services at the highest level - from the reception desk to room service, in the Fala restaurant, in the swimming pools and in the SPA. The rooms are very comfortable, clean and large. Food is delicious, very large selection, beautifully served on Swedish tables, varied, fresh. Large, clean, warm water pools. Brine pool - a dream! ! Rescuers attentive, kind, friendly. In general, the whole staff smiling, eager to help, kind and helpful. Really appreciative words. We'll definitely go back there."
2618,"We managed to book a hotel room for about 100 PLN, which is a great price. The beds were super comfortable, like in ibis. There is a bus stop and a city bike station nearby. As we requested, we were given a room on the top floor, and the staff were nice enough to exchange early check-in for late check-out. The only downside was the lack of a phone bill with the hotel, she spent about 10 minutes on the hotline and nobody spoke up. In the hall in the morning apples were distributed, which was very nice : ) I recommend this hotel ! From room 923 you can see part of the Palace of Culture ; )"
2619,"Lego costs 4x more? Well, folding this set right away shows why. There is no tragedy at all, after the element holding the wheeled trolleys, which I can't exactly push in. The rest is composed as much as possible, the durability is also ok. The rest is made of harder plastic and yet it scratches more. Fingers hurt because of the hardness after a few minutes of folding. And the problem only begins when you have to separate something from the plate. The nails fall off, often you have to use other tools (teeth, knives). The wheels in the axles so come in that eventually they make a hole in my hand almost a centimeter deep. . . The tank does not fit perfectly either. The wheels of the cars ride poorly because something rubs off. The tracks are wobbling and much harder to fold compared to Lego. The compound locomotive looks lovely (not counting the stickers, which are better to give yourself and not stick), in fact, the whole compound set looks good. It's fun to play with. To sum up: it is certainly not a complement to Lego Trains. However, as the expense of 500 PLN exceeds the possibilities, and the child wants very much, as much as possible. But you can afford Lego give up on Dromedar / Ausini."
2620,"The unpleasant service, 90 € for 6 hours of sleeping in a double room (entrance directly from the trip), is a huge exaggeration for such squalid conditions. Parking is additionally charged on the street without supervision. Pictures of rooms with pictures of cakes and desserts? - What is really advertised. He was 'em on the spot and as soon as he entered 'em so soon he left 'em this place without getting into a discussion about . price . If it was lower the score would have given m - 10 points. I definitely don't recommend it."
2621,"These innovative heart valve prostheses are designed for both adult and pediatric patients. They may be particularly important for younger patients due to the potential for growth and remodelling of the implanted valves, which creates hope of reducing the risk of re-surgery in this group of patients. According to the FRK promotion department, work on bioactive heart valve is based on the latest solutions in tissue engineering, bioengineering and material engineering. As a scaffolding for the creation of biological heart valves, acellular pig matrices on which autologous cells are cultured are used. In order to achieve this goal, a comprehensive system has been created to ensure that bioprostheses are cultured in bioreactors reproducing natural in vivo conditions, which should ensure high durability of the valves."
2622,"""We've achieved our planned results. We supported both the larger and smaller animal dentures for a month. The dentures worked properly, confirmed their hemodynamic performance, functionality, and the way they interacted with the heart and circulatory system. The dentures were free of clots, none of them had a defect, the animals did not have any inflammatory reaction"" - he added. Currently, there is only one German paediatric denture on the market, used in several dozen children also in Poland. ""Heart failure in adults is a more frequent problem, it is even a social disease. However, heart support in children is also developing. It is a more difficult field, because dentures need to be miniaturized, but it is a technological challenge that needs to be taken up, because children's heart support systems are needed"" - said Roman Kustosz ."
2623,"Much of the time we have been travelling around Wroclaw recently, we have been visiting hotels and as it happens, once is better and once is worse. . . In this case, bad memories remain. We don't want to be claimed, but we advise you to improve a lot of things and start from scratch such as cooking, cleanliness. . . We do not recommend!"
2624,"She's been treating me with a doctor for over a year. I still had problems with the infection, which the doctor prescribed me various antifungal and antibacterial drugs, but none of them helped. The drugs he prescribes ""blindly"" and as you can see from my example they are completely wrong. At first I considered him to be a good doctor, but over time I found out that he was another doctor who ""goes for the number of patients and not for the quality of treatment. Maybe the result of neglecting a patient is the number of places he works in, so much so he gets lost. I have the impression that at the moment he only cares about the money he gets for each patient and about her leaving his office as soon as possible. DEAR DOCTOR, MAYBE YOU SHOULD RESIGN FROM WORKING IN SEVERAL CLINICS AND FOCUS MORE ON THE HEALTH OF THE PATIENTS, BECAUSE THANKS TO US YOU STILL HAVE A PLACE TO WORK."
2625,"I had only one contact with the doctor so I can't say that he is very good on the basis of one visit, no less surely he is a concrete man and with a very high level of knowledge, he doesn't promise golden mountains, he tells you how it is and what you have to do with it. I recommend"
2626,"The group of prof . Małgorzata Lewandowska - Szumieł from the Medical University of Warsaw has extensive experience in the selection and settlement of cells for a given case of bone tissue. This group deals with the method of settling a porous structure created by engineers, resembling a sponge. The group is now preparing to study the effectiveness of colonization in mouse research. The Oncology Center is leading the project from the medical side. The task of the group dr . Janusz Jaworowski's group is to select appropriate patients, to work out how facial bone defects look like - in order to then develop model implants and examine them. Designing and testing the course of bioimplantation surgery is very important for patients. Patients are already being operated on using a computer system and surgical navigation."
2627,"I'm not judging Dr. Luboñski yet. I was with him once. Now I have a second visit. But I have to say he knows what he's saying. She had an arthroscopy 7 years ago, after which I was promised that I would be propelled into the basket as before. Unfortunately, my knee was unstable right away. Sport - only in the stabilizer. She thought it had to be like this. Two weeks ago she had a trash injuries and a knee block. It turned out that I had ripped off my anterior cruciate ligaments. And the doctor confirmed and announced a reconstruction procedure. She decided to wait in line for the procedure financed by NFZ. I deserve something from them since they botched the previous procedure. As far as referrals are concerned - dr Luboñski does not have an agreement with NFZ, so he does not give referrals for MRI. I do not penetrate. With a heavy heart she paid me for a private examination, which they did practically overnight. 630 PLN . in Avi Centrum . A visit of 150 PLN . each time, a commercial operation in the clinic of the Ministry of Interior and Administration - 7 thousand . ha ha ha ha - I prefer to rely on the mercy of NFZ . If I do not have an operation by the end of January, I will go privately ."
2628,"Good morning, Sorry, but I can't recommend this doctor. She made a private appointment for me to visit her thyroid. As I'm suffering from hypothyroidism, I know what an appointment with an endocrinologist looks like. She came in with a ready-made thyroid ultrasound and tsh. The result of the tsh very bad, she was convinced that on that day I would get another dose of the drug to start stabilizing the tsh level. The doctor said that the result was bad, but you have to do additional FT4 tests etc. Of course this is normal but you would have to start treating the patient from the visit. She had a lot of questions and she wanted to tell me that my thyroid is giving me a bone. Unfortunately, I wasn't given any. She was in the office for 5 minutes and she paid 130 PLN only to hear that you have to do additional tests. No endocrinologist had ever treated me like this before."
2629,"Not only the Hilton but also the IHG is trying to enlarge its portfolio, the Hilton is trying to do this InterContinental. In addition, competition in the market for the lease or management of hotel facilities is growing. Accor and Louvre Hotels have already taken the first steps. ""Adam Konieczny points out that the year 2012 brought about a major development of franchises of the largest hotel groups, in particular the Best Western chain. Accor has also focused on developing this form of cooperation, especially with regard to existing hotels. Budgetary chain hotels are becoming more and more popular, and this year brought many new openings, including Ibis and Ibis budget hotels in Warsaw and Kraków as well as Campanile and Premiere Classe in Wrocław."
2631,"The hotel is quite good class, but they are not 4 European stars, only much less. Beautifully situated by the bay, with a wonderful view and a small charming beach, unfortunately very rocky. The village itself is small, with no attractions, one shop, one tavern. A well-stocked shop on the hotel premises. It is worth visiting the island and take advantage of organized trips or rent a car. A place for those who want to relax and calm down, rather not for funny young people. Internet access only at the reception, in rooms paid for, very weak. No Polish channels on TV."
2632,"Surely this gentleman is qualified, so I won't deny it - after all, he has a p- o. However, the approach to the patient is a different matter - NOT APPLICABLE. The patient is not treated as a human being but as a medical case. In the hospital, she works on a piecework, she does a great deal of grace to examine the patient, who preaches him ailments after the operation or floats her away at all - inhuman. I hope that they will finally privatize our health service, because in total we pay anyway. And if they do contracts, then they will be forced to treat their patients with respect and dignity. With all due respect, Doctor, but please think about your way of being and your approach to another person."
2633,"After one day we resigned (family 3 + 2 children). Generally weak standard . Rooms ( 2 ) even quite large, but the furniture is already present. On a fold-out 2-bed Half is a hard plank - no chance to rest. The soundproofing of rooms . For example, in the bathroom, dry exactly what the neighbor is doing. . . Neglected object: squeaking doors, burnt bulbs, carpets probably 20 years old. . . The TV remote control is not only sticky from dirt but also disintegrates and is taped. Breakfast is the peak of insolence. Half ( ! ) of a tomato for 5 people and margarine for bread . The cheapest sausage and slightly slippery not the first freshness. Generally, culinary is a failure ! The advantages are the location - close to the park and the center."
2634,"A wonderful holiday stay . A place worth recommending . I think it will delight the most demanding. Delicious breakfasts with a rich offer will satisfy the most sophisticated tastes. I was delighted with the honeycombs in frames. Taste cups went crazy. Delight for the palate . The abundance of dan during the dinner All delicious . . Discreet service, refined interiors . I am a fan of palaces and castles - I love their climate and history . This castle is certainly worth a visit. The most famous stud farm - a magical place. Janów does not delight in itself, and it is a pity. With such a neighborhood as the stud farm and the castle it is really surprising. Unused potential . But the castle is a base for exploring the surrounding charming places and unspoiled nature. I'm delighted with Podlasie and I'll be coming back there."
2635,"After we went on a weekend with the children reading positive reviews but we were very disappointed with our stay in this hotel, probably the worst place I've had breakfast so far is some kind of embarrassment I was in front of my children who are used to a different standard on the tables dirty, dishes not homemade, no bread to wait for, a poor selection of cold meats, burnt pancakes, poor when it comes to vegetables, Coffee as water, the dishes of the card also do not delight plus just for room service waiters try as they can but if they do not have the possibility of the kitchens there are no miracles, as far as the apartment is concerned the carpets need to be replaced feel the dust that floats out of them generally the rooms need to be renovated because they repel the decor from 15 years ago, the same bar that can be called a burrow, for over 1000 zł. For 24 hours I require although after no breakfast and exclusive room it was my first and last time in this place I never write a bad opinion about anyone but this place deserves my hope that the owner will take it to heart."
2636,"Serious bone damage can occur as a result of e.g. cancer or accidents. A common solution used in humans has been to place a metal implant in place of the damaged bone. However, this implant must have remained in the body for the rest of its life. In the case of animals, more serious bone damage - e.g. in the paw - usually resulted in amputation of the limb. Meanwhile, researchers from the Faculty of Material Engineering of the Warsaw University of Technology have developed a bioimplant - a solution that helps to rebuild damaged bone tissue. It's a polymeric scaffold printed on a 3D printer and porous as pumice stone. After being implanted into the body, cells of the patient's bone tissue can grow on it, gradually rebuilding the bone."
2637,"Location is not bad - close to metro stations and tram and bus stops, although the area scares a bit. Tasty breakfasts, nice staff. The room is small, but clean, although I did not like cleaning at 4 pm and later and forgetting to supplement cosmetics in the bathroom. Wifi works quite poorly. Overall, however, the place is quite pleasant, just in time for a few nights in this beautiful city."
2638,The architecture of this hotel is really sensational and this is certainly a big advantage of this hotel. The interior design and available facilities are also a plus. The big downside is that you pay for the room by booking directly at the hotel and for example: for a traveler is cheaper. . . .
2639,"She signed up for a private visit after reading positive reviews. But I won't put it out. She was with a 1.5 year old child on a visit. He had a problem with nails from his feet. The doctor gave himself a flashlight on his nails and, quoting a few possibilities, started to talk about what could be here for the child. Instead of writing down some ointment - because I suspect it would be suitable - he finally gave a referral for blood draw on the iron level. At the end he said that you can go with the baby to the beautician! By the way, when asked about the red and rough cheeks of the child, he found that they were not greased enough. As it turned out later: ointment was enough on the child's nails :) instead of forging with a needle. As for the cheeks, apparently the doctor did not recognize himself on allergy! ! ! ! ! I don't recommend it! ! ! Lost money! !"
2640,"The property does not warn before or after the reservation that there is a BATHROOM BOX downstairs, also not recommended if you want to get some sleep. In addition, at midnight, a fan ( ? ) was turned on in the kitchen, which by rhythmic knocking made it impossible to fall asleep until 2:00. The hotel is asked to renovate the ceilings with moisture, broken fixtures and cracked furniture. For such attractions 70 PLN per day."
2641,"Hello, unfortunately I also share the opinion of a PC person, a very expensive diet, I ""guessed"" myself with another person who had an almost identical diet, in addition the price of the 14 day diet is high, and in fact the 14 day diet is a 7 day diet only rewritten for 2 days. Mrs. Anna has already gone for the number of patients and not for the quality, which is a pity: - ( . For me the settlement system is also unclear: - ( . Greetings"
2642,"An old socialist hotel in a neglected area, the main entrance at the heap of death. In the room there are old uncomfortable beds, no kettle, an old TV tube. The bathroom is dirty, molded, malfunctioning bathroom fittings. Towels of doubtful purity . From the pool bar there is loud techno music until late at night. The food is cold, monotonous and of low quality. Free WiFi weak only next to the reception desk, payable also without revelation. All in all, it is a waste of money for such a ""dream holiday"". I wouldn't recommend it and I'm still surprised that such an object is on offer in the office."
2643,"I've had this juicer for over six months. On the one hand, I am satisfied because the juice can be prepared really quickly, unfortunately, it is not a flawless device. First of all it makes a lot of noise. I don't know why the chips from fruit and vegetables don't automatically go to the bottom of the waste container, but they only collect at the top, which after a while causes clogging and prevents further work. Another disadvantage is that it is difficult to disassemble the device in order to wash it. The main element, the sieve, has to be removed by force. It has tried different ways, but to take it off you have to pull up very strongly. As far as the price of the juicer is concerned, it is rather at an average level. She decided to buy a juicer from this particular company because she had a multifunctional food processor with MPM and she was very pleased. This juicer, unfortunately, is rather average."
2645,"One of the most wonderful places that we discovered for holidays with children (6 and 8 years). The rooms are very nice and clean, the garden is full of attractions for the whole family, and the food is very tasty, varied and unlimited, which will please every hungry person! The family that runs Kowalowe Wzgórze is so warm and committed that you will want to come back here 100%, and your children even more so, because the presence of other families with children guarantees great holiday friendships! There are a lot of attractions around, every day you can visit something interesting in the area, and in the evenings there is always something going on, you will be able to milk a fudge, make butter, ride a horse on a vault, take advantage of art workshops, see how honey is made, play billiards, play in a hammock, eat a sausage from the fire. . . . until it's hard to count! The hosts are happy to tell you what else you can visit, they also have additional discounts! We personally recommend Teplice Rock Town, Radochowska Cave, Bardo Rally and all the surrounding gold, coal and uranium mines. For history enthusiasts the whole Riese complex is close to everywhere! Prices are, in my opinion, very reasonable for Polish standards this year, especially that everything is clean and neat! I recommend with all my heart, you will not be disappointed!"
2646,"With a clear conscience I recommend Dr. Madej, he was with many specialists who could not help me. But the doctor found 'em understanding my problem. P . Madej was very committed to curing my smile and thus my health. After the treatment I speak much better, I have better diction and most importantly I do not gnaw my teeth I can enjoy my straight and healthy teeth. I also want to mention the cost of the treatment, which did not strain my wallet. Madej approached my problem individually as opposed to the other doctors who wanted to do the standard treatment, which I was not enthusiastic about. Visiting the office in Nowy Bemowo (Widawska) is a pleasure because Mrs. Madej's passion and commitment to her work will translate into the satisfaction of the person sitting in the chair. I did not think that visits to the dentist can be fun and this office is a confirmation. With full responsibility I recommend ."
2647,"A crazy nice and warm person. She prepares tasty and nutritious sets of meals for the time specified by the customer. I have never been hungry, and sometimes it was difficult to pass the portions specified by Mrs. Marta. It is hard to believe that with your own enthusiasm and the advice of your dietitian we achieve victory - that is the assumed weight. My service has been professionally conducted thanks to the website and the guidelines included in it. And the details were discussed by phone. I am very happy to recommend Mrs. Marta to those people who do not seem to be able to achieve the goal by themselves - she will help, she can do it. Agata"
2648,"The form is over the content ! Very expensive hotel 4 * which should have some 2 * . There are many attractions such as: bowling, skates, horses, aqua park, etc. Everything is tacky. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. It is possible that couples with a child can be happy"
2649,"Hotel generally ok . Clean and that's enough. The rooms are even spacious, and in some cases air conditioning. WiFi works decently. Breakfast in the form of a Swedish table a little poor but let it be. Parking is additionally paid. Proximity to the center undoubtedly an asset . For one night, I can recommend it for business. Greetings"
2650,"Applies to a laboratory in organic chemistry I . General evaluation : super ! ! ! Very interesting activities and the way of conducting, relaxed, friendly atmosphere. Knowledge until it comes to mind: ) The final assessment consists of: a colloquium of theoretical knowledge, attendance at classes, two analyses, keeping a laboratory diary and a literature problem."
2651,"In this hotel only rooms are ok. . . . .that is clean and bright. But we're not going on holiday to sit in a room. Unfortunately, the food is average. Breakfast is served as a buffet and every day one and the same and very modestly. Dinners, although we have had our dinners bought out, we ate outdoors. The biggest problem was with parking the car. . . Massacre! The only advantage is the view from the balcony to the Atlantic and very close to the beach!"
2652,"An unquestionable advantage of the hotel is its location - very close to the sea and the boulevard leading to the center of Gdynia and to the beach and free parking. After entering the building we move in time to the 70s / 80s of the XX century. On a good day came out a confusion with the payment, because the staff said that they did not give 'em full details - fortunately, I had a printout of the reservation, so the clash won 'em and managed to arrange everything. I had a room in Lux version, a little bit small. The friends' room lacked a window handle - the opening after it was clogged with something, but you have to admit that it was very clean in it, the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was OK, there was a very good roulade of baked bacon, but there was not enough for everyone. At a good price it would have benefited me once again from the accommodation."
2653,"She spent several days in this hotel during Easter. A very pleasant stay. The hotel is mostly renovated, the rooms are very nice, new and clean. The restaurant and the food is also great. Only the recreational part remains much to be desired, the swimming pool is old and dilapidated and simply put, unattractive. The playroom for the younger children is pretty cool for it, something like a mini prank park. The hotel has a lot of activities for children and teenagers, you can play table tennis, foosball and console games. There are also outdoor tennis courts at the hotel. Very close to the sea and the beautiful beach, which compensates for any imperfections. Nearby a nice restaurant at the beach ""Marina"". You can also walk to the center of Sopot. Price for a stay in this hotel very affordable . To sum up, with a clear conscience I recommend ."
2654,"We were in this hotel a group of more than 80 people prepared a conference room to play in which there was no place to dance (the dining room stood empty where it could accommodate 100 people lightly) on Friday cold water for bathing after the intervention of the receptionist Saturday boiling water. Good food . The rooms were relatively clean, but the communist regime was aware of itself. The hotel stayed in the 90s - those ."
2655,"Half of the world's research and statistics on an occasional basis clearly show that the biggest scourge of hotels are petty crimes: thefts and seizure of property of not very high value. In these cases the greatest harm to guests, but also to the hotels themselves, is the violation of privacy and loss of trust in the level of security offered by the hotel. However, the criminals loot not only guests' belongings, for which the hotel is responsible, but also the equipment of the hotels themselves. On February 5th in Kielce, an unidentified man in one of the rooms first broke a brass shower on 9 parts, and then broke two more faucets from the sink."
2656,"I'm an ""old diabetic"" but I haven't seen such things yet: 3 insulin therapy, insulin analogues, free penins and glucometers, individualised diets, movement prescriptions, and daily access to a doctor without registration. Computer analysis of glycemic profiles . Has anyone seen such a Diabetes Clinic? ? ? And on top of that, you can talk. THANK YOU! ! !"
2657,"A week spent in August showed many disadvantages of this place. If you respect money, don't ever leave it there! The building is completely neglected, dirty. . . the staff is forced to work there as if they were working there as a punishment. the impression is that the owner has decided to ""roll up"" the business and does not care about anything anymore. a room with a warped door, barely closing, unpleasant, with a bed sticking out of the dirt, a crooked garden table covered with worn out and a hole in the kitchen. in the bathroom, an old sheet on the floor - pretending to be a pavement. One of the ladies from the service was asked to ""clean up"" the room but she did not even advise to look . TV for half the stay did not work, and about a decent working internet can be forgotten (there is no option to load and watch any movie) . Breakfast - a failure. on one small table, the cheapest and the most sublime food from Biedronka - one kind of bread, margarine - there was no butter, marmalade - such as for dough, the cheapest pâté, one kind of sliced sausage, for the whole week's stay once a ""dish"" on hot - sausages. For the last three days, you could drink only chemical fruit tea because the usual one was missing. After asking about the most common tea, the lady from the staff hid in the back and did not give any answer. For a tasty coffee you have to go outside the ""villa"" . The courtyard, just like the building, neglected and with a general mess. of course, in every place you can find something positive - here you can only mention the company of a charming cat walking around the ""mansion"" . . . . . .but one cat ""villa"" will not save the place so to sum up - to avoid this place! ! !"
2658,"The doctor is a nice man, he talks a lot about ailments, he gives a lot of professional terms, it's a pity only that every time it's completely contradictory information. Because of that she made an impression on me not very interested in what she is doing because it is the only way to explain it. I do not question the competence, but I personally went to another doctor, because my problem has not been solved despite repeated visits."
2659,"We were 2 weeks at the turn of July and August (11 people in total). Views of the beautiful food pride service friendly bartenders serve pride drinks ( especially beach bar ) . The rooms we had in the bungalows were a revelation with a view of the sea. a lot of stairs, but after the meals, the traffic is recommended."
2660,"The ideal place to relax . For three stars just great. Quietly and quietly in the heart of the forest. Very good access, well signposted. The room where we lived was large with a comfortable bed (double) . A large balcony. Tasty meals, big choice. Nearby beautiful lake, a lot of nordic walking routes. It is worthwhile to stop for a while."
2661,"The hostel is well located (close to the old town, next to the tram stop, 24h pharmacy, 24h deli, pizzeria). We used two rooms, two rooms with bathrooms. One room was quiet but very dark (poorly lit - only the wall lamp and the floor lamp), the other one was well lit but the trams passing 2 meters from the hostel were breaking off. In the room there is a tiny metal table, 1 chair (minus a 2-person room), a large double bed and a sheet for a single bed (the effect from under the sheet was sticking out from each side of the mattress), a TV set on the wall, a wardrobe, in the bathroom there is no shelf or table - nothing can be put down, no rag to the floor, leaving the shower always left puddles. The advantage was that the bar in the building did not work. The kitchen on the second floor is but as if it was not there because there was no electricity. Breakfast is modest (yellow cheese, melted cheese, bread, margarine, jam, honey, flakes, milk, coffee, tea - all the cheapest ARO). Plates and bowls - partially broken. The service works for the benefit of the staff - helpful, contactable, smiling. There is an elevator in the hostel"
2662,"A person incompetent for such a position . Thanks to her, I had a repeated fracture, more than half a year of treatment was in vain, due to erroneous expert opinions and doctor's recommendations. She didn't care that I was out of work, had nothing to live for and wanted to heal the fracture as soon as possible. During the visits I didn't find out more during the treatment I was helped by physiotherapists who suggested various possibilities. With incomplete adhesion the doctor stated that I am healthy and sees no contraindications to perform even heavy physical work. Nowadays I am a person who can't screw on a screw or hold a drinking cup upright - the doctor doesn't see any mistakes - all the fault of a patient who is ""pushy"". This resulted in 4 operations and disability for the rest of my life. I advise against it."
2663,"Dr Lenecki is a professional ; ) . For some time now, I have been having a headache. In one of the hospitals I had an X-ray taken and the doctor who examined me then diagnosed me with sinusitis and prescribed an antibiotic. Despite the end of the antibiotic there was no improvement, another doctor and another antibiotic. Situation as before. It was only after a long time of torment that I found Dr. Lenecki, who after seeing the X-ray and the description of the disease by previous doctors grabbed my head and explained to me that the problem is not the sinuses, which are clean and there is nothing in them. My problem was allergic rhinitis, where no antibiotic therapy was needed. After Dr. Lenecki prescribed me regular pills and drops for allergies, the symptoms disappeared. From now on, I only go to see the doctor, even though sometimes you have to wait in line for a really long time ; ) ."
2664,"The guy is okay, he gives a pretty simple rump on his lap. In case of failure you can get along - in my case, in the year of analysis II made a total of 5 appointments."
2665,"The hotel, in comparison with other places we visited, was quite poor. The cleanliness of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired. The internet is paid €20 per week (and it's not good enough to pay for it anyway). Deposit for bath towels € 20, spas € 12 per person for 2 hours of use (entrance from 14 years) no kettles in the room, fridge to use for € 10 / week the same safe. I have not seen swimming pools cleaned in any way for a week. I'll sleep it entertaining during the day. Not at all. I wouldn't go back there anymore."
2666,"Blaupunkt tokyo 110 - very nice appearance, large, easy to read RDS display, has forgotten by other manufacturers function, mute . As for the loss of waves as described by other users it is unfortunately true, today in one of the company vehicles I had a strong signal wave set up, where suddenly on the overpass lost the range, I thought I was silent - suddenly found it with a roar and a double sound announcing ; ) The radio looks very cool, there is no cd reader, it is usb, as for the power of signal reception Blaupunkt did not show off."
2667,"We spent two nights at the hotel. The room was clean and a large, comfortable bed. We also used the restaurant. Very good and varied breakfasts. The dishes from the card also worth recommending. There is also a spa, fitness and swimming pool area in the hotel, which we did not use. Attentive service. Nice atmosphere of post-industrial buildings. We liked the lockable ""locker"" for bicycles."
2668,"Unfortunately, today, my husband and I came to the Diamond Hotel for the weekend, and unfortunately, at the very beginning, we were disappointed - we received a room with a view of the concrete wall. . . Despite the request to change the room, I was informed that this is what standard rooms in a 4-star hotel look like. She has never seen such a room in any hotel before: ("
2669,"A team of young researchers from the Jagiellonian University in Kraków under the supervision of Professor Tomasz J . Button from Kraków and Prof . Andrzej Wysokiński from Lublin showed that living in a polluted environment negatively affects the cardiovascular system of young healthy people. The study was conducted on the initiative of medical students of Jagiellonian University and was financed by the grant ""Generation of the Future"" from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. ""We compared the risk indicators for cardiovascular diseases in inhabitants of two Polish cities - Krakow and Lublin, which are similar to each other in terms of demographics and climatic conditions, but differ significantly in terms of air pollution. This applies in particular to pollution by particles with a diameter of 2,5 micrometers ( PM2,5 ) and 10 micrometers ( PM10 ) "" - explained PAP prof . Button . He reminded that Kraków is one of the most polluted European cities, while Lublin is located in the centre of one of the least polluted areas in Poland. The data obtained from air quality monitoring stations show that in the last 10 years the concentration of PM2 , 5 and PM10 in Cracow was about twice as high as in Lublin."
2670,"I highly recommend to everyone this small but charming hotel. Nice design and very nice service. There is a parking lot in front of the hotel. You can take an elevator to the floor. The hotel has a swimming pool and a nicely decorated sauna. The food is tasty, the Swedish table. The hotel's surroundings are picturesque. Have a nice stay!"
2671,"Dr. Sobieszczańska is a great specialist, I think the best in her field, and she has met many of them. The visit in the office goes exactly as I expect, that is in the atmosphere of full professionalism. Whenever I come to her with my problem, I get effective advice and help. Perhaps it is a matter of always being prepared for the visit and choosing the words precisely. What I value in cooperation with Ms. Doctor is a brilliant and even intuitive communication. I myself, in my everyday work, rely on competence and full involvement in performed tasks. I'm glad that my health is taken care of by a person who has similar values."
2672,"Their results indicate that guests treat the fitness studio as one of the key elements in choosing a hotel. The new program available at Westin hotels also eliminates the frequent problems associated with the lack of space for sports equipment in the luggage and this was also given as one of the elements that prevent them from practicing sports on the move. The Westin Warsaw celebrated the global introduction of the Gear Lending programme developed with New Balance for the lending of sports shoes to guests. The hotel staff celebrated this by running together. More than 20 employees of The Westin Warsaw took part in a 5 km run, the route of which led through the Saxon Garden and Nowy Świat."
2673,"Moulded-in rooms with wallpaper falling off, untrained staff! ! ! Stinky and undisinfected bathrooms! ! ! My clients got indigestion after dinner! ! ! I suppose the cognac served was a fake! ! ! Or at least an old weathered crap! ! !"
2674,"Very good value for money ratio. The guesthouse is very nicely located, there is peace and quiet everywhere. The rooms are large and nice, but not very well cleaned. The food is very tasty, there is no problem with arriving before or after the times of serving meals given at the reception. The service is nice and helpful. The downside is the distance from the lake (800 m, including a piece through the forest), the lack of a guarded beach and the possibility of using the wi - fi only in the reception building. Good base for trips to Gietrzwald and Olsztyn."

2676,"I strongly recommend, she gave birth to two of my children under his control. Always nice, smiling. Distracted, that's right, a little twisted, that's right. But I don't agree with the allegations that he lacks competence. She was with him and in private, and in the hospital - the women in line may have complained about the waiting time, but there was no one to complain about the treatment. She listened to the stories of women who had been struggling for years to get pregnant and it was he who helped them, which was also the case with my friend. Sure, there are downsides, especially when it was a few years ago, now it is probably different - it was coming to the hospital clinic. But it's like being born in Copernicus - you either want to be born in luxury, or you want to be sure that you are under the care of the best specialists and you can table inconveniences. Greetings, Professor, it's been a long time since we've seen each other: ) ."
2677,"it was my first time at your doctor's, I'm not from Bialystok, but I can't compare how gynaecologists are in my town and Mr. Mikołajewski is a big difference, he knows his profession, he's nice, he's polite, he knows how to talk to a patient, he just knows what he's doing, I greet him warmly."
2679,"Apartment 4L, I do not recommend because of: - squalid tenement house, dark rooms (you have to turn on the light during the day), - lack of cleanliness in kitchen drawers (dirty dishes, burnt pot, lack of e.g. glasses, cutlery), - bad smell of moisture in the bathroom, water from the shower had no proper drainage due to clogged drain."
2680,"When a doctor enters key patient information in the application, the system will generate recommendations of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), which are the same as those in force in Poland, tailored to the specific clinical situation. The doctor, knowing what is recommended, will make his own decision. ""Oncology aims to make the treatment of patients individually adapted to their clinical situation. Therefore, it is important to assess the patient in clinical terms and to characterise the cancer in biological terms. Knowing the biology of cancer, doctors can conclude on the course of the disease and on the drugs that will be most effective. The results of the latest scientific research are included in the recommendations for treatment. Doctors are obliged to follow these recommendations, which is not always the case in practice"" - admits Dr Ługowska ."
2681,"My husband and I have just returned from our New Year's stay at the Lubicz Hotel. The whole complex makes an impressive impression from the outside despite the still unfinished area around the hotel. The room is nicely decorated, clean and cleaned every day, but we definitely ran out of reading lamps in bed - unfortunately, in most hotels there is a problem with this - and lamps with a fixed material shade do not solve this problem. I was a little bit angry because I forgot my mobile lamp attached to the bed frame from home. The pools were great, although they could be a bit cold in the morning, the saunas were ok. The problem is often the parking spaces in the underground garage, although we managed to park there, many people complained that for 30 zloty they have to stand ""under a cloud"". The food is abundant, the breakfast is great, the buffet is rich in salads, cold cuts, cheese. Dinners are great, delicious soups, each time you can choose between two types of fish - always great and we focused on that. Generally a hotel worth recommending"
2682,"Hotel very interesting , "" other "" than all , large rooms , comfortable beds : - ) ...and the climate is clean and generally cool everywhere. Unfortunately, I give only three stars: - (just during my visit in the hall downstairs it was a wedding and the whole night was very loud and you could hear the fun. . . nice but not for someone who wants to rest and sleep. . . The kitchen is like this. . . - I don't recommend steaks, a dry, not juicy cook has to practice making them a little bit more and you have to wait too long for food. And one more thing I don't know who you were in black glasses, but if it's the hotel manager then it should be a little less noticeable because it sows unnecessary fear and arouses stress not only among your guests. . . A big plus for the restaurant staff, very nice and competent waitresses."
2683,"My humble person is discouraging him. The good doctor doesn't say at random that the patient has a malignant tumor with metastases and that for the time being, get out, get out, 'cause he's going on holiday. While in another clinic in Lodz it turned out that the cancer is actually but not malignant and to be cured. And my grandmother for a week was broken down. So even a simple man does not act like this doctor."
2684,"She tried to tell me by phone how to get to the hotel, but she heard me only that I have to get a taxi from the station. It took Black Friday and the whole center was crowded, so it was impossible. She came to me on foot, but she didn't get me instructions on how to do it. There is air conditioning at the hotel which was not long ago cleaned because after a night in the room I got up with an infected throat and for a few days I can not speak. Please clean the air conditioning system for the sake of the people sleeping in the hotel! On site, the new people in the service were already nice and effective in providing information and lending the hair dryer . A modest but sufficient breakfast ."
2685,In such a climate so that there are no air-conditioning in the rooms is the top. The rooms have windows like in a cell or there is no air coming out of the chimney. We rented a fan for 3 euros a day it was a bit better the noise came down a little bit better the lack of care youngsters robbing the door screams general haos
2686,"I have had this screwdriver for a year now and it has been repaired twice during the warranty period, the head has been sprinkled on a slightly different and hopefully more durable. The screwdriver is quite strong, perfectly balanced and works nicely. The batteries last quite a long time with continuous operation, the second one will recharge if you have anything because the charger just fell down: (and the screwdriver will probably return to service because you can not buy the second one anywhere even from the manufacturer. The head starts to move sideways, but this can be caused by a fall from a fairly high height. Quite a good screwdriver for the right money but better to add and buy another blue manufacturer"
2687,"Girls, I warn against this ""Doctor"" going to him for 5 years and saving me contraceptive pills all the time. The liver tests had to be done by me in private. When she stopped taking the pills and after many efforts I got the coveted pregnancy, she tried to register me at the clinic to Dr. . However, the waiting time was so long that in the meantime she miscarried m . I was devastated and helpless when I finally got to see Dr. Knurowski. Knurowski he underestimated my miscarriage. She asked me for tests to exclude thyroid problems or high levels of prolactin. The doctor stated that such tests do not fall within the scope of basic examinations and he will not give me a referral. He said that I could do such laboratory tests privately. I have no words to describe how I feel after this visit, how I was treated. This ""doctor"" can only write out the pills and rip them out of the booklet. . . ."
2688,"A very good and competent doctor. He explains all the issues related to the disease so vividly that every patient will understand it. He answers every question comprehensively and is also very nice and friendly. Since I needed additional research, the doctor, through his contacts, set me up with the best specialist. By the way, I'd like to add that I've been waiting months for such a visit! Further treatment goes beyond the responsibilities of Dr . Tomasz , informed me where I should go further and asked for information about the progress of treatment. With a clear conscience I recommend Mr . Thomas . Such physicians are really rare, which is a pity."
2689,"Innovative work on the implementation of a hybrid ultrasound tomograph for women's breasts was co-financed by the National Centre for Research and Development, which supported it with a grant of PLN 6.9 million. According to PAP NCRD's office, it was the support directed to entrepreneurs from the competition ""Industrial research and development works carried out by enterprises"" under the Operational Programme Intelligent Development. This is one of NCRD's main programmes addressed to entrepreneurs. Its innovative formula - reduction of formalities to the necessary minimum, the call for applications carried out in stages and the short time of issuing the decision on co-financing (60 days) - is very attractive for companies. NCRD grants for the implementation of R&D projects by entrepreneurs are granted by NCRD on a competitive basis, on the basis of experts' assessment - explained the NCRD press office."
2690,"The treatment should start with a change of diet, which should be a low-purine diet, with less meat, giblets and seafood as well as alcohol and fructose products. ""However, in this way, uric acid levels can be reduced by 10 to 15%. Therefore, if this proves to be insufficient, pharmacological treatment is necessary - said prof . Widecka said. Pharmacotherapy consists mainly in using a drug that blocks the activity of xanthine oxidase, which reduces the concentration of uric acid. ""The treatment starts with a small dose of 100 - 200 mg/day and increases to a maximum dose of 700 - 900 mg/day if necessary. In general, the so-called maintenance dose of 300-600 mg/day is sufficient,"" explained prof . Widecka ."
2691,"It is hard to believe that at the fingertips of the capital we have an ""object"" that allegedly has two stars. . . ...as I'm about two too many for me. All the negative opinions about this place posted on the web are true. Ford, stink and poverty. Breakfast cuts off the legs, or rather the lack thereof. The lady of the staff and the elderly gentleman are talking such nonsense that they want to laugh and cry at the same time . To sum up, if it is not possible to spend the night in another place, avoid La Grandpa's wide arch and one more thing, the lady behind the bar dilutes whisky with water. . . The night I froze 'em: ("
2692,"Despite a clear request for a hot broth, he got 'em only slightly warm ! ! And for the chanterelles from the frying pan, an extremely simple dish, the waiting time was 1h and 5 minutes. The waitress did not even say a word that she is interested in whether we like it or not. Generally very poorly and I do not recommend it."
2693,"I'm sure the great advantage is the research that the professor commissions. The advantage is also that you don't have to drive too often to visit because many things can be done by phone. This is the first doctor who looked at me in full, listened and answered questions. Together with the professor she was trying to get me a child ; - ) After several months of unsuccessful attempts she referred me to another doctor who was supposed to take my treatment. Eventually, it turned out that I was already pregnant at that time, so the treatment was effective. I generally recommend it."
2694,"A great hotel and service. Actually, it was planned to be an autumnal day, but the weather was playing tricks on us and so we spent a wonderful winter week. The rooms were very well equipped, cozy with very good sntardart, so we did not miss anything. Delicious breakfast as well as very tasty and hearty lunch and dinner. Fantastic beds - the gateway to the Karkonosze National! AD - AD - 22 - 44"
2696,"A cracked wall in peace . No ventilation in the bathroom . On Saturday evening, the Muslim rumbles until 2 o'clock in the evening. There was a terrible instant coffee on the sniafama and there were apples made of fruit. In the toilet in the hall at 9 a.m. on Sunday, uncleaned vomit."
2697,"I was at Mr. Matthew's for knee pain in Bochnia Hospital (visit within the NFZ). Poor Mr. Doctor could not devote as much time to his patients as he should and probably would like. I was waiting for a visit for about half a year and it turned out that the visits take place at the pace of the production line, there is little space for establishing personal contact. Just as soon as possible, just as efficiently. . . . .it was not bad, but there was something missing - time."
2698,"The visit lasted 10-15 minutes (with the procedure!), Mr. Zakrzewski made a diagnosis of the disease and decided to laser remove the lesions on site. As it turned out after the treatment, the lesions were completely unsuitable for treatment in this clinic, due to the lack of appropriate laser. He emphasized this after the treatment, saying that he has the wrong equipment for this type of cases and invites you to Warsaw, where he uses one that will help in this case. However, the doctor decided to check if the laser would work in this case. I will skip the fact that without anesthesia, where during such procedures anesthesia is standard. Of course, the cost of the visit exceeded 600 PLN, and the disease problem remained. Additionally, he was not helpful, not interested in explaining the problem. In contrast, I will give you what the treatment of this problem looked like later in the clinic in Budapest - first consultations and pharmacological treatment (as it was said - essential in this case, because the disease can come back after the laser). The laser can be used to remove any changes without any problems, without any pain, using an anaesthetic, a pleasant atmosphere, communicating in English and removing any changes without any problems. The cost of the whole treatment is 800 PLN."
2699,"The doctor's office is in Otwock. The office is nice with rehabilitation facilities. The visit was conducted in a factual atmosphere, you can see that the doctor takes the work seriously and thoroughly. But one thing I missed very much: the doctor is so objective that sometimes it is too cold and dry. I understand, there's nothing to laugh at, neurology. But some smile would come in handy, some good word - it reduces unnecessary distance and fear, creating a good psychological basis (neuroses bow!). There have already been many professors and they, the ""great"" professors can be more friendly."
2700,"As he added, HIV, although it is extremely ""clever"", has only three enzyme proteins that regulate its life cycle and infectivity. Prof . Jaskólski and Dr. Wlodawer examined two of these three proteins: protease and later integration. In the following years, the researchers determined the structures of the proteins of other retroviruses - including the HTLV virus causing leukaemia - and helped to explain the mechanism of action of the drug effectively fighting lymphoblastic leukaemia in children . ""Here, it was exactly the opposite. The leukemia drug, asparaginase, was found by accident, but the chemical mechanism of its action was not known. Our structure explained to us how the molecule of this drug is built and how it functions. This opened up possibilities to improve its therapeutic properties, e.g. by eliminating side effects"" - explained prof . Jaskólski ."
2701,"I've been treating for RA for over 20 years. The doctor is another rheumatologist who treats me. She devotes a lot of time and attention to the patient and tries to find out as much as possible about the disease and adjusts the treatment to the person and not only to the disease. I think he is one of the really good doctors in this specialty. The disadvantage is unfortunately the long waiting time in front of the office for an appointment (sometimes up to 1, 5 - 2 hours). That is why I give the grade ""I recommend"" and not ""VERY GOOD"" as I was going to give ."
2702,"A double room is a pleasant surprise - the area is larger than in 3-star hotels. Clean, elegant. The staff is courteous, nice and always available. Breakfast is modest, but well - something for something. Location - very good - from the Central Station you can walk to the National Stadium on foot. Outside the window construction works - a little loud. The room is full of switches - one for the light, the other for ventilation - you don't know what to do; - ("
2703,"It is inconceivable that the doctor should not inform you that the time for which I was enrolled is not a term for my individual visit but an ""open"" term, where the ""first come, first served"" principle applies. The first visit was individual and the second was supposed to be the same. Despite the discomfort of the loss of time (I waited for 1 . 5 hours) paid the same amount of money to em as for the appointment for a particular individual hour. However, the worst thing about your doctor's admission was the lack of discretion and respect for sensitive problems of patients. In the waiting room, where 7-8 waiting patients were sitting exactly and clearly (despite the radio on) you could hear the doctor talking to the petitioner. In my opinion this is unacceptable. As far as the treatment is concerned, the doctor did not come out for a standard scheme of action, he wrote a prescription for a drug which he could easily get for himself."
2704,"It is more difficult to study them, especially outside our facility, but they are an excellent and reliable set of data for analysis. They help to build visitor segments that largely reflect actual group behaviour. Needs and expectations with regard to the group of services that consumers are looking for . They relate to the benefits that potential guests can gain. What can the hotel offer them, especially against the background of competition? A very pragmatic approach, which allows us to influence the purchasing behaviour towards us with a high degree of probability. At the same time realizing that actually the lack of loyalty of the guest (caused by orientation to direct benefits) can cause an equally quick escape to the competition. They refer to the purchasing power of people ."
2705,"The joke apparently evokes the situation in Gdańsk described, among others, by Polish media. To support the thesis about the excessive appetites of hoteliers ""Deutsche Welle"" quotes Jan Wawrzyniak, the head of the Berlin branch of the Polish Tourist Organisation, who says : ""In fact, the hoteliers have apparently recalculated themselves"". The fact is that in March or April hotels in the host cities limited the availability of rooms in the reservation systems, artificially creating prices. Only in June, when it turned out that there were no people willing to spend too much money on accommodation, the hotels introduced more rooms. However, since many fans have already bought cheaper rooms in other localities, many of the rooms were left unused."
2706,"Perfect location is the biggest advantage of the hotel. Delicious food, a wide range of choice plus the possibility of dining on the terrace with a view of the sea. Beautiful rooms with free WiFi access. Nice service. The only downside is the paid parking at a high, but adequate to the quality, price per stay."
2707,"""We have tested our media on three species of bacteria that cause meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. We detected their presence correctly in 95% of cases, and the species identified us with a certainty of 98%. And since we are talking about extremely sensitive Raman spectroscopy, it was enough for us to find a single bacterial cell to obtain such precise results,"" stresses Dr Kaminska. The whole process of analysis is largely automated and reduces the contact of the laboratory technician with the sample to a minimum. In order to perform the measurement, it is only necessary to take a microlitre portion of cerebrospinal fluid under the laminar extract to a syringe and then place it in a syringe pump connected to the Raman spectrometer. In order to increase the reliability of the measurement, the recorded signals are processed by software using advanced statistical methods and the operator only has to read the result ."
2708,"I live abroad. Finding specialist help in my native language involved online meetings. In search of the right person, I was browsing the internet and sent me a lot of emails. From the first message and then the phone call, Ms. Klara told me that she understood the situation she was in. From the beginning, the meetings were held in an atmosphere of trust and kindness. During each session with the help of a therapist she opened up to her needs and discovered the source of her emotions. I am still in need of specialist help and our cooperation is not finished, but I am very grateful for the help that Mrs. Klara has given me so far. With all confidence, I recommend."
2709,"I agree with the opinion of my predecessors. Dr . Szyller led my pregnancy and took very good care of me. He says clearly what makes us feel more confident and know where we stand. It's just a shame he doesn't work in any hospital. Because it's very important. If everything is going well it is ok, but if there are complications it is difficult to count on help in the hospital of doctors for whom we are alien. That was my case. I was at the end of the 41st week of pregnancy, and I had no symptoms that I have to give birth. No one was able to take my rabbit. Luckily, I was taken care of in time by Dr. Bishop. Grabska. She saved the life of me and my son. She started to act, not like the others made her wait. She had a cesarean thorn. Thank you very much for that. That's what she meant by saying that the attending doctor is useful in the hospital. Both doctors deserve recognition. I highly recommend them."
2710,"The hotel is situated on a hillside of a bustling white sand beach near the picturesque town of Moro Jable (I recommend visiting it). The food is good and everyone will find something for themselves, unfortunately, in the all-inclusive package only 5 alcoholic drinks the rest for an extra charge, no music by the swimming pools, no hair dryer on the balls, elevator only in the main buildings, where we lived on the 2nd floor, daily carrying of our child's pram and luggage on the day of arrival and departure very troublesome, a small number of waiters especially at dinner."
2711,"I'm very happy to see Anna and I sincerely recommend to everyone. I decided to consult with a dietitian not only to lose weight but also to support a proper diet my treatment. I received from Anna a professional advice and diet plan which was not easy to construct because it had to take into account my health problems and also work in 3 shifts. I treated this consultation primarily with training to eliminate nutritional errors and to learn how to balance meals. After a month of strict adherence to Anna's recipes, I started to adapt my favorite foods to the healthy eating principles learned from Anna. She was also given advice and support outside of the office, and this was free of charge, answering all questions in full. After several months of following Anna's recommendations, not only did my health improve significantly, but I also lost weight from size 44 to size 36 without ever being hungry or frustrated. My whole family has also benefited from the change in my eating style - the household is healthier and much slimmer. I'm going to continue to follow Anna's recommendations because they have proven themselves in practice."
2712,"By winning a well-known and respected hotel chain Iberostar hoped to be satisfied with the choice. Unfortunately, the hotel turned out to be a total mistake. If a holiday would cost 2 thousand zlotys certain facts could be silent but for the amounts you pay for this hotel you get very poor quality. The hotel seems to be new, but you can see that it has already worn out a bit. The beach is not far away but it's not like it's directly next to it. The hotel is quite far away from the center of the village, so there is not much happening there. There are no attractions in the hotel, the animations cry out for vengeance to the sky. Maybe for seniors okay but for young people unfortunately not. The pool is quite small and there are not too many sunbeds either. The room has nothing to worry about but the problem was with the air conditioning, which the hotel at specific times turns off, explaining the environmental protection. The worst point of the hotel is the restaurant, which is too small and often lacked free tables. It was also absurd that you couldn't often sit at a particular table because the staff prepared the table for the next meal, at breakfast they already prepared for lunch, at lunch for dinner and so on. As for the food, I am most disappointed here. A small selection of meals, no variety, every day the same. Often it was like that for breakfast there was just nothing to eat and on the next meals the best thing was pizza. Coffee, tea and juices could only be drunk for breakfast, for the next meals the coffee machines and juice machines were covered. I wonder why the hotel has such high prices for the stay when there is not much good to say about it. Mallorca is beautiful but I don't recommend staying in this hotel. There are many cheaper hotels that provide a much higher level and choice of food. Unfortunately my choice was not successful."
2713,"My syphon lasted for 5 years, but unfortunately, working with it ended up flooding two rooms, pulling out the shower tray and forging parts of the cabin because of the inner part of the shelf. The cost of repair 3 thousand zloty. If I was doing the bathroom again I would certainly not have decided on this product, unfortunately now I had to buy it again to not rework the installation, the recommendation of an expert. Another thing is that my cabin practically did not have insulation under the shower tray, so the first professionals did not do their job properly, hence the huge damage. If you decide on this product, I recommend that you take a close look at how the trap is pulled out, that the drain does not clog up, and if so, seek professional hydraulic advice before you flood."
2714,"At first sight a very nice, modern hotel in Lodz with good conference facilities. It seems to be in the centre but "" in the middle of nowhere "" . Probably the hotel would get a better rating, but as usual people have failed. The management, to be precise. We organized a very successful conference there. We rented a lot of rooms and lecture halls. And it's hard to get attached to anything, if it weren't for the fact that at the very end the hotel deleted us for. . . . .over 100 parking spaces, of which we used maybe a third. To our arguments to count the actual number of people using the car park, we were told that ""this was the contract. Hands are dropping. Thus, for a couple of thousands of easy money, the hotel lost one good customer and probably many more of the conference participants we meet on a daily basis and we did not fail to discourage them from using DoubleTree by Hilton in Łódź. Unfortunately, such bums show a true approach to customers, which, apart from the slogans and corporate dagger, is simply ignorant and, what can be said here, not very professional."
2715,"I have treated two of my teeth with Mr. Rafał and I am satisfied not only with the results of the treatment but also with the whole treatment process in which I was informed about the course, risks and success of the treatment. All this made me feel calm about my health and dentition. I recommend it to people who value professionalism."
2716,"I bought this phone a month ago, just to use the Internet, because I have another phone to make calls or write text messages. The first day I bought this smartphone, as soon as I started using the internet, I was still stuttering that the massacre, pissed me off so much that I stopped using it. The reason is that I can't afford an expensive phone and for this one I paid em over 300 PLN so over half of my pension. Besides that, the battery quickly discharges enough 2 minutes of calls and I have to charge the phone again. The only advantage is the recording of calls and the appearance of this phone . I am really very sorry that I decided to buy this phone. I'm sorry about the money!"
2717,"We love watching these hilarious videos. They are not directed, they show the natural reactions and reflexes of people to unexpected circumstances in which, by coincidence, they find themselves. Not all the jokes are complimentary, some are even unsavory, but you can always choose something that will hit you and at the sensitive point of your sense of humor. However, she definitely did not want me to be in the place of these people. You have to have an incredible distance to yourself to accept the words: smile, you are in a hidden camera!"
2718,"""Breast cancer is the most common female cancer and any new device that improves the detection of breast cancer contributes to saving lives. The ultrasonotomograph has the chance to become a new tool to help you detect breast cancer more effectively, and in the future perhaps even a new standard of diagnosis for this cancer. The new device combines the numerous benefits of various existing methods and removes some of their limitations. Unlike mammography, during ultrasound examination, the breast is not compressed and is not exposed to X-rays. The images obtained are three-dimensional, just like in computer tomography, but without the use of harmful radiation"" - explains prof . Jóźwik . ""The hybrid ultrasound tomograph scans the whole breast using ultrasound waves of about 2 MHz frequency from many directions around and at many levels, and then processes the acquired data and reconstructs images of any of its cross-sections"" - said Andrzej Wiktorowicz from Dramiński S . A ."
2719,"I've been a pilgrim for a dozen years, I was tempted by this partner in November 2016. Easy to start and work well, lightweight, handy, convenient but too small an oil filler hole and too small a volume of fuel and oil tank - you have to often refill them, the air filter basically clogs up once after about a week of work (about 3 hours of daily work of the saw) - cost of a new 10zł, and after 3 months the gas line broke (each press of the gas cuff breaks the line - such a strange design solution) - the cost of the new 40zł, as for me a little too high cost of maintaining this saw - I am disappointed with this model of partner."
2720,"I wanted to register yesterday in 4WSK to Dr. Gavrísia , but I was told that the enrolment for the second quarter will only be in February, and the first one is no longer available. Could someone kindly who treated himself in 4WSK to Dr. Gavríś answer me how this quarterly registration looks like? Do you have to come on the first day of registration and stand in line, e.g. at 4 am because there will be no more places later? You hear various things about registering to good specialists and so far I have not had the pleasure because I was not sick. . . Besides, I have a question whether if I get an appointment and get treated, will I have to wait for the next one for 3 months again or will the doctor himself set me a deadline? And is such a quarterly way of registering for specialists as in Weigel's case rather the norm or does it look different in other institutions (with NFZ agreement)? Thank you in advance for your answer. I think it will also be useful for others who are not familiar with it. . . Greetings"
2721,"First the advantages: the hotel is very nicely located, modern and clean. You can see that it has the potential to create a climatic place there. Unfortunately, a lot is still missing and here are the downsides: the hotel does not open its windows! There is no point in paying for the view of the lake if you can't go out on the balcony in your own room - despite the beautiful weather. But the central air-conditioning system blows constantly. The breakfast room is spacious, with a balcony, but also closed. It is not possible to have breakfast in the air. We were hit by a company event and access to the terrace was defended by a security guard, who did not allow us to leave. The staff was also bloated and not very polite, especially at the reception. Much better is the lobby bar and spa. Beware of the pool - such a huge facility and such a number of guests is far too small! 8 people and it is crowded. Similarly, saunas - max 4 people. I would like to point out that parking is additionally paid for, which a guest will only find out about when they pay the bill. If it is not enough, the price of the parking should be calculated overnight so that there is no surprise. In addition, it would be possible to arrange the waterfront, make a bridge and what someone has already mentioned - a kettle in the room and not tea from the coffee machine for 9 zł. On average, very average."
2722,"""The number of transplants from living donors since 2001 has exceeded the number of transplants from deceased donors worldwide, but in Poland we are still on the grey end, because in Poland this level is only 3%. Meanwhile, transplantation from living donors is the only possibility to improve the quality of life and treat patients who are treated with dialysis on a daily basis"" - said Witkiewicz . Prof . Hubert added that in France the transplantation rate from living donors is about . 10% . "" However, they would definitely like us to increase it to at least 30% . We managed to achieve such a value in the hospital in Nancy and this is definitely due to the robotic method"" - explained the doctor ."
2723,"I wouldn't recommend it unless somebody doesn't care about the standard, the room on the mane wall, the awful bathroom and toilet, only the room as such, but the lack of even a radio without talking about the TV or the phone. You can hear the sound of water flying from other rooms, the room smells of cigarettes despite the smoking ban. Breakfast is terrible, coffee is disgusting, very temperamental choice and there is still something missing to ask for cold meat or cheese."
2724,"I don't recommend it. We got a doctor and his son, suspected of celiac disease. I (mom) have a gluten intolerance, so the very loose and frequent pile of pile made us look for a solution to this problem just in this direction. The child additionally (year and a half) gained only 400 grams for half a year. The doctor said that the child does not gain because I give him too little wheat! And yet, as you know, the wheat is getting fatter. . I was very surprised by this statement, especially from the mouth of the gastrologist. Low germination indicates bad absorption, which also suggests coeliacs. As a part of the advice we were given a recommendation not to appear at the doctor's office anymore, and if necessary, he advises to do the test for coeliac disease on his own, because she does not see any indications. I would add that the visit was under the NFZ, and the research in question is reimbursed, although very expensive. In my opinion the doctor was neither kind nor competent. I think that if it was a private visit, where the research is done and so at your own expense the conversation would look completely different."
2725,"""Nature has given us the best baby food. It is, of course, breast milk, which is why I am in favour of feeding babies with breast milk for a long time. The World Health Organization recommends that babies should only be breastfed for the first six months of life, and if this is possible, feeding should continue for two years. However, it is clear that natural feeding is not always possible,"" said Dr Joanna Bryś of the Warsaw School of Life Sciences. In situations where infants cannot drink their mother's milk, special nutrition is used. However, the ones available on the market are not perfect, they can cause constipation and calcium losses in the youngest children. ""I was fascinated by this subject and started to research infant nutrition"" - describes Dr Bryś. It turned out that the cause is the wrong kind of fat contained in modified milk."
2726,"It's the only word that's pressed against my mouth. Booking for a double bed, on the spot it turns out that the room is more like a brush box with 2 beds. The room is a ""higher standard"" room with an extra charge. A room for the undemanding but to call it a higher standard would not tempt me. The balcony is connected with all the rooms on the first floor, which you can walk through freely, and if someone just let a pet out on the balcony, you can wander around under someone else's dog's window. Cleanliness at a relative level, parking fee 15zł per day but the barrier raised all the time so that every visitor ""for a moment"" can peacefully park for free. I ask myself, what do I pay for? I do not know if the rooms for non-smokers and smokers are shared at all. Throughout the whole stay the stench of smoked cigarettes was coming out of the room next door until you could feel it when you walked into your room. The bathroom is a clinic with a toilet at such a height that 1 . 80m person sits down and his legs are hanging in the air . . . Really? I understand that it's 3 stars but when given? such a strong 1 . 5 would say m . Gym. . . . . eh here he didn't expect 'em and he didn't get 'em so he didn't let 'em down too much. Administrative failure. . . The fee charged at the beginning of the stay turned out to be uncollected at the end of the stay at check-out. . . The hotel staff asks the guest to explain the alleged underpayment of other guests ? We have not heard about data protection as I understand it ? Wi - Fi is so rather conventional, for 3 days I was able to use it once and I would not call it ""use"". At the very end of the day, the KITCHNESS - the meals are prepared without any problems until you want to eat them. To sum up, if I don't pay my money back, I will not return it to you."
2727,"Dr. Iwona is a professional in every way: ) Going to the dentist I always feel a terrible fear. Dr. Iwona is forgiving and delicate, very kind, patiently explains every problem and what I like the most is the fact that she is very firm and concrete in her actions. For me it is a clear sign that the specialist who takes care of me knows perfectly well what and how she does. It allows me to feel safe. I know that I am in good hands. And also a smile and warmth. . . . . . .after fear and no trace. Mrs. Iwono, thank you."
2728,"For some time now I have been visiting various doctors because my son, fifteen years old, is growing up too fast. . . .and his heart is not following him. So what's wrong with what happens sometimes. I was referred to Dr. Rycaj by chance. . . . .it's probably lucky for me to meet this doctor on our way. Very kind, kind, competent. Humble in the face of what life is about. . . . . .uplifting. . . .of us parents. . . . .in more than one case very desperate. . . . . .afraid of what will happen next. . . .and yet capable of making the right decisions and comforting us.

2729,"I was only on my first visit, but I am pleasantly surprised. Until now, I have been treated ""in the dark"". ...and she didn't really know what was wrong with me. After today's visit I feel like I've been taken care of by the right person. The doctor explains everything thoroughly, she asks about the symptoms, she is very nice and factual. I will see how the treatment will continue, but after the first visit - a huge plus.)"
2730,"A terrible place, dirt and dirt again. On the floor, stains, hollow bedding, walls seem white but fresh paint have not seen for a long time. It seems like a LUX room ( funny ) . Access cards to hotel doors more often did not work than they did, not only we had this problem. The staff supposedly understood the reported problems but . . . I don't recommend it. The best theme is with the ""stars"" of the hotel. All the 4 * , logo, website, facebook.pl, etc . And here, surprise at the reception desk, we found out that there are 3 . The photos on the website look beautiful, in fact, not necessarily. Breakfast was, say, ok ."
2731,"Weekly trip with a 3-year-old child. Apartment in the building Eta (at the very end of the building, but quiet neighborhood (there was no noise and bustle from the Sigma building). The apartment is huge, neat and clean, fully satisfied our expectations. On the plus side you have to add that the radiator in the bathroom operated dynamically, and the air conditioning could be set for heating (we hit the coldest beginning of June for 40 years with rain and cold). The room was cleaned daily with a daily exchange of towels. On the plus side of the apartment should be counted that the free WI - FI from the lobby. The surroundings of the hotel are well maintained (trimmed lawns and hedges, daily washed deck chairs around the pool). Water in the pool at the beginning of June is cool, but this is the norm. The beach is huge, but quite neglected. Rarely raked and cleaned. It is easy to find glass and cigarette butts. The indoor pool is quite large, with heated water (just in time for rainy days). Tasty cuisine, although some claimed to be monotonous. In my opinion you could always choose something for yourself ( Sapphire restaurant ) . In Diamond Restaurant more intimate, but less choice and often eating too cold. During the season it can be really crowded. Apart from the hotel, there is nothing interesting in the immediate vicinity. To the city by car or bus about 3 km. I recommend renting a car and going to Nesseberu (16km about 15 minutes) or Sozopol (a bit longer). Overall, the trip was successful."

2733,"We went to the guesthouse near Kotelnica with a 4-year-old child and friends on New Year's Eve. It was our first and last stay in this place. The guesthouse has a great location for skiers, close to Terma Bania, the rooms are clean and that would be as good as it gets. Rooms for 2 people with a child are very small, there is no fridge in the room and the TV is very small. It's more like a monitor than a computer. There are no cosmetics for bathing in the bathrooms so we had to buy it right away. The sockets by the bedside cabinets in the last days of our stay were not working and after connecting the iron to another socket, the traffic jams in the room blew up. . . . The food is very fragile. Breakfast without revelation, during the 6-day stay, dinners were only 2 and also without revelation. We were with a child and it was completely missed at dinner. There was no plate or even a chair at the table for him. We had to use a child's chair that was unstable and we had to be careful not to roll over with the child. The New Year's Eve party also disappointed us. There was no mention of alcohol, so we prepared our own bottle of whiskey. When we entered the hall, we realized that there were 4 bottles of vodka on the table. Nobody from our company drinks vodka and there was a problem. . . The landlord came and asked us to bring our own alcohol into the room and if we want something other than vodka, we have to buy it in his bar. . . . .in a bar where, of course, everything is much more expensive! For the whole event there were 2 jugs of compote (for 9 people) and water with lemon without a surcharge, but to get the water we had to drink compote because there were no more jugs in the hotel The food was poorly seasoned, more sanatorium than in the hotel. You can see that the owner wants to make money by giving as little as possible of himself."
2734,I hope it turns out to be a good hotel and my family will be happy with this vacation? ! I think someone will tell me the truth and I will decide on this hotel when I read the opinions of all the people they are different! !
2735,"""We know that parasites have an amazing ability to inhibit the immune response of their host, which allows them to settle for a long time without causing an inflammatory reaction. Thus, in persons with autoimmune diseases, the presence of intestinal nematodes in the body results in the inhibition of an excessive inflammatory reaction and, as a consequence, the symptoms of diseases such as non-specific inflammatory bowel diseases and even multiple sclerosis (MS). Our experiments were aimed at indicating the mechanisms that are induced during treatment with live nematodes in mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis - the SM model. During the experiments we identified a new population of leukocytes, the number of which increases significantly during remission of the disease in mice infected with nematodes"" - explained Dr Donskow - Łysoniewska . Further studies have shown that it is possible to activate and increase the number of such leukocytes not only in vivo, but also ex vivo, in blood taken from diseased mice. ""The discovered mechanism is very likely to work for other autoimmune diseases as well, as it may be universal. We are about to start experiments on mice affected by Alzheimer's disease"" - adds Dr Donskow - Lysonskaya."
2736,"Everyone writes that your ENT specialist is a good doctor, maybe so, but why is it that when a person suffers and has a referral with a LAPD, he makes you wait two months and in private a few hours, can you call such a doctor GOOD? and where does HIPOKRATES swear here? ! (I think fast money is more important for the doctor) !"
2737,"It was my first visit to an endocrinologist. After the positive entries about the doctor, I was positively inclined, but I felt that Joanna is haughty and indifferent. The visit was very fast and nothing was actually explained to me. She got a lot of tests to do for a few hundred zlotys. The visit took place in Salve, while the doctor recommended me to do the tests in another institution, dictating me her phone number, because she also works there and there are promotions. . . Today I was with the results of another endocrinologist, who was surprised to find out why she did some tests. . ."
2738,"The average doctor seems to want to help, but on the other hand he seems to be in a hurry and has no time for the patient. So far Dr. Olszewska is completely ineffective in the treatment of sinuses, and she has been doing this for about a year, there is no improvement. She prescribes the same drugs."
2739,"The hotel is medium sized, offers standard prices and quite large rooms. The food in the hotel restaurant cries out for vengeance to heaven. Breakfast does not stand out, but is an acceptable, continental standard in a tourist hotel. Dinners, on the other hand, are ""pâté-German"" and nothing is able to erase the negative image of these meals. During the week, I ate more mushroom sauce than in my whole life. For dinner, a ""potato"" with a heavy, thick sauce, usually mushroom sauce, is obligatory. In the kitchen there is a culinary illiterate who proposes to chicken in five flavors potatoes (there was no rice). For seven days, the kitchen did not even once tempted to prepare groats. Once there was pasta (burnt, with chilli peppers). One time there was rice with apples and cinnamon for breakfast. Although rice for breakfast is not my delicacy, I ate a portion and two extras, because for dinner, again, these potatoes and mushroom sauce, baking or mushroom sauce. Given that the hotel advertises itself as family-friendly with children (in fact, German pensioners dominate among guests), the kitchen has forgotten about the children's menu! For me, food is an important element of recreation, hence the low rating of the hotel! I sincerely advise against buying dinner. They are heavy, pâté and German and a person with minimal culinary requirements will not be satisfied with them. A better option then is a twin Olymp (across the street) who has rooms with kitchenettes where you can cook something yourself."
2740,"A lady who knows what she's doing, meticulous and meticulous to the point of putting the paperwork, the formalities over the patient's welfare. She lacks human reflexes and is dry and unmoved. It seems that professionalism is the most important thing here, but at the same time the lack of feeling, and thus lack of compassion or simple human kindness, throws the baby out with the bathwater. She has made a lot of trouble for me, I do not recommend."
2741,"Before entering, the husband asked the doctor if his wife, i.e. me, could come in for a consultation with him. Your doctor categorically refused, and said that he was delayed. I know that every patient has the right to be accompanied by a close person while providing medical assistance. This right has been exercised by us despite the doctor's objections. The consultation took place, Mrs. Dr. Dr. evaluated the x-ray and gave her husband an answer to a fundamental question. Despite the positive diagnosis, the consultation was accompanied by unnecessary nervousness."
2742,"Hello for more than 2 years I have been sick for my stomachache and none of the doctors could tell what it was caused. The office of Dr . Solomon found 'em on the internet and decided to make an appointment for them . Mr. Dr. Solomon's office. . . Salomon did all the research so he found out what was wrong with me. The tests were carried out professionally on modern equipment and discussed in a reliable manner . After a year, my health condition improved a lot thanks to Mr. Dr. Salamon. Solomon . I believe that you, Dr. Solomon. Salamon is a very good doctor and a professional. With a clear conscience I highly recommend Mr. Salamon. Solomon."
2743,"She chose this hotel because it seemed the best in Zielona Gora. I am a little disappointed - there is no elevator in the hotel (!!!!!!), which made me have to bring a suitcase to the 1st floor. Admittedly, the receptionist offered help, but it would be too embarrassing for me to have a suitcase to carry a woman (the man was not at hand). The room was rather small, without a bedside table. Microscopic bathroom . Besides, the standard was ok . Tasty breakfasts . The service was nice, although probably a little disrespectful to the guests: she asked me to prepare a breakfast package (she had to leave the hotel at an hour). 5 . 30 am, when the restaurant was closed) She pointed out to me (in a conversation with two people) that she wanted me to get rye bread sandwiches (she ate them for breakfast the previous day) and without butter. What did she get m ? Wheat roll sandwiches with butter, which she noticed only in the train, when she was leaving Zielona Góra. The effect was that the breakfasts that she paid for m, she did not eat m . In general, I will only return to this hotel if I really have no choice. It is expensive, which does not correspond to quality. I travel a lot, for the price she paid me in a Qubus in ZG, in a hotel of another brand, e.g. Novotel or Mercure, she would have a higher standard."
2744,"A great hotel, we had a family suite, two large rooms, overlooking the sea and it was a great shot in the arm. The food was delicious, and very varied, with several swimming pools and a huge area. For the children there was an inflatable castle and a playground + pool with slides and attractions for the little ones. I recommend to brother For an extra charge the view has the sea - you will have rooms overlooking the north side - then there is no need for a climate control : - D willingly tm I will go again : - D"
2745,"The medicinal properties of sauerkraut were first mentioned in Hippocrates' writings in the 4th century B.C . However, the first great sea trip of the famous traveller and explorer James Cook brought her fame. ""Thanks to its high vitamin C content and easy storage during long journeys, it turned out to be an excellent panacea for scurvy, which at that time decimated sailors who were deprived of fresh vegetables and fruit for a long time"" - recalls Dr Ciska. For his observations and conclusions concerning, among other things, the impact of a diet enriched with sauerkraut on the health of sailors, Cook was awarded the Copley medal by the Royal Society of London in 1776.

2746,"I suggested the Opinions read in this forum . Unfortunately, in reality, it was not so professional and nice. My wife and I had a big piece to the dentist's office in Łambinowice and we wanted to do as much as possible during one visit. Unfortunately, we were often invited for another visit, which was associated with a waste of time and another expensive journey. Mrs Nadia is not so nice and professional, she also treated herself and unfortunately after a month a piece of the tooth she was treating broke off. With these prices it is also not at all colourful first visit and valuation free of charge but later during the treatment the doctor does not stick to this valuation. One of your assistants is very nice but this is the only advantage of this dental office I do NOT recommend! ! !"
2747,"I've had a phone call for several months. Generally, there are no major drawbacks except for the terribly dirty screen - after about 2 hours of use, the entire screen is covered with fingerprints and dust that pulls like a kebab booth of hungry students. Unfortunately, the device has a whole lot of small things that can't be changed and which are annoying e.g.: missed calls are shown as received and lasting 30s, it's not possible to assign a number in the ""quick dial"" under the key 1, it has strange applications that send notifications non-stop - support doesn't know what such an application should do, some options (e.g.: contact synchronization, auto - update) work only on wifi even if we allow them to work on the com network. The support application can also be used to switch on the screensaver when watching videos and playing some games, the vibration is very low and so on. I was very disappointed with the technical support, which in practice does not exist. On a few sent requests almost all of them remained unanswered (now a few weeks) and in case of others heard em answer we do not know. There is no perfect phone , P10 is certainly not some terrible October but I can not recommend it . Huawei as a company has shown off its ability to piss off customers * * * * * * so this is definitely the last Huawei I'll decide on ."
2748,"A professional doctor, and she's nice and polite. For a few good years I have been tired of almonds (tonsillitis and other unpleasant problems), previous doctors said that this is how it should be, that many people would want to have almonds like I have and give antibiotics in the dark. Mrs. Tatiana cured me completely from the ailments. First a referral for a smear, then an attempted antibiotic treatment and finally a referral for a removal procedure that she performed. Despite the complications of the surgery, she managed without any problem. After the surgery, when I had any doubts about the healing, she always helped. I am 4 weeks after the surgery and everything has healed nicely, you can already see the huge effects of getting rid of this ""I won't say what"". I definitely recommend"

2750,"Pluses : The biggest advantage of the hotel is probably the breakfast. The location is not the worst, because you can get to the Syntagma square by one bus, without changing trains. Well, maybe a nice gentleman who fixed us a fault with the lack of hot water. Minus: First of all, the rooms do not match the photos on the site. It seems to me that the people taking the pictures chose the best elements from several rooms, took their pictures and threw them into the service. When they saw our room, they were surprised and maybe even disgusted. The smell was very small, the room was very small and the bath was so small that you can at most dip your feet. When they asked us at the reception, why didn't we get a room like the one in the pictures, we only heard: You wanted one like the one in the pictures? It is not available. And when will he be free? We don't know. Luckily, we got another room a little better than the first one. In the morning we found out that the room in the pictures will be free, just when we are leaving. . . . As for me, it just doesn't exist. Not to mention the lack of hot water - fortunately, this fault was quickly fixed, by a nice man."
2751,"Terrible food. I do not recommend ! Not comfortable beds. Cleaners take money when they're on top. A bed made of several mattresses. Close to the center and that's just one advantage. Hotel towels don't change at all, and when they come to clean up, they just move things in the corner. The glasses give the rooms dirty."
2752,"""Sports activities of children with diabetes are, however, very positive, as they help to compensate for diabetes and protect against chronic complications of the disease,"" the specialist stressed. ""At the beginning, controlling the glycemia seems to be very difficult, but you can learn it quickly, you just have to keep self-discipline,"" said Joanna, the mother of 11-year-old Nicodemus, who trains in the team preparing for the championship in Arnhem. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a year ago. The boy has always been very active, for example, in sailing. ""After the diagnosis there was a fear that he could continue to do so, but it turned out that there are no contraindications,"" she added. She pointed out that the insulin pump, which is a device for continuous subcutaneous insulin administration, is a great convenience."
2753,"The hotel is located on the outskirts of Jastrzębia Góra, but the center can be reached in a few minutes. Near the beach, just cross the street and we are at the exit to the beach. There are a few steps to go, but my 2 year old daughter has managed to cope with them. The hotel itself is well maintained, the rooms are clean and tidy. The food was good and varied. Very good desserts. Nice, professional service. Large parking lot. Pool a little too deep for the kids, no paddling pool, but there is a lot of pool accessories for the kids. The playrooms are very nice and well equipped. Interesting animations and cool animators - baking pizza super idea. On the downside: - some toys in the children's zone paid (eg . cymbergaj, cars), I'm a little pissed off by such customer plucking - no paddling pool for children Certainly a wader to go and check."
2754,"Unfortunately, I have to give a completely negative opinion, this doctor I do NOT RECOMMEND, incompetent, I confirm the negative opinions, that the doctor still repeats the same. My period disappeared completely, I was already on the verge of a nervous and health breakdown, she did not know where to go. . . It happened to Mr. Bucior (she hadn't read these negative opinions before) at first nice, he did me a number of tests and found that the cure for calling can't be done anything and prescribed the worst possible hormone (for me) Cilest! Then he told me to come in 3 MONTHS! I felt terrible after him, I was depressed, my libido was reduced to a minimum, I was dizzy and nauseous. . . After some time, the period appeared, she went to check on me. He said that ""Nothing is happening to me"". ...did the tests, took the money and had it come back in 3 months. And I foolishly took me the Cilest, even though she felt bad. . . She told Dr. Bucior, he said that ""so be it, it's a sign that the hormones are doing their job"" and he didn't change my medication. . . I arrived after those unfortunate 3 months, Mr. Bucior didn't even do the tests, he gave me a prescription with Cilest again and told me to come in 3 months. Then a red lamp lit up at my place and told me to come back. She went to another gynaecologist who said that ""the one who prescribed me the Cilest should burn in hell. ...the drug has done so much damage to my body that my head is small. It is good that I found me a competent person, Dr. Buciora, I strongly advise against it, based on some knowledge, which I regret to God, acquired from equally inexperienced and materialized people."
2755,This is the first time you've seen 'em. He convinced em that he was a very nice man. He very understandably described my ailments and told me exactly what to do in my situation . I am very pleased with your doctor's attitude towards me as a patient and I thank him for that.
2756,"In particular, people after cataract surgery should remember about eye protection during hot weather. ""Patients after cataract surgery have artificial lenses implanted, which are transparent and do not filter the light in the same way as natural lenses. That is why they should especially protect their eyes with sunglasses, because there are more and more of these patients - and this at an ever younger age,"" she added. In the case of children, sunglasses are not always advisable and ""you have to be careful here"". ""If the glasses only darken the image, they will prevent the pupil from narrowing, that is, those natural protective processes that take place in the eye. This will cause that much more unfavorable light will fall into the eye, that is, in our conditions, if a child is to wear any glasses, it is better that he or she does not wear any,"" she noted."
2757,"Fantastic location for those who appreciate peace. Rooms in the main building are not worth the price - people who rent them expect much better service, and for all guests it is the same. The rooms in the bungalows are much cheaper, and much closer to the beach. Although from the bungalows you have to get to the main restaurant a bit, but it is a very pleasant walk. Nice greenery in the area of the village, in the area of a lot of steps (you can watch them in the evening) and cats - you have to be careful because you are willing to move into a nice room. In the case of this hotel I rather not recommend the all inclusive option. It is better to go for dinner to Cost Calma or a trip to the depths of high. It is a pity to spend the entire holiday tied up in the hotel . Unless somebody is going on a board then all knc as much as possible. The only downside to a hotel is that it's a poor service that tries to ignore the guests as soon as it can. Interestingly, you don't just have to wait at the reception or restaurant, but even when you rent a car. (We have decided to rent a car at a cheaper rate at full cost). Generally a hotel worth recommending."
2758,"I don't recommend I don't know who assigned 4 stars to the hotel here. . . The rooms are terrible, small, old furniture, the only plus is the balcony - we just had a big one. As far as the kitchens are concerned, there was no madness in the food, boring and monotonous breakfast every day the same. In addition, on the last day we were treated terribly having bought an all-inclusive package we had to pass the stripes at the reception until 10 o'clock, and we were only entitled to lunch, we couldn't even drink water in the main bar. We were treated very badly by Mrs. Ewa serving in the main bar. This is the first time we have encountered such a situation, I do not recommend a hotel and I advise you to avoid it, there are better hotels around. The chairs are ripped, water is pouring from the ceiling, dirty rooms."
2759,"An excellent doctor. Already the first conversation with Mr. Doctor gave me the feeling that I am finally in good hands. For more than half a year she was treated by another doctor in a wrong way and with a completely wrong diagnosis. In your contacts the doctor is very specific, you can see a lot of knowledge and expertise. At the same time he is nice, very kind and committed. By pointing out the necessity of the operation, he can prepare and calm the patient down at the same time. He explains thoroughly the methods of treatment, patiently answers questions to dispel all fears and doubts. He has time for the patient at every stage of treatment. Currently I am after the surgery, I am recovering quickly and I wholeheartedly recommend your doctor as a high-class specialist and a great man. Thank you very much."
2760,"I just got 'em back from Bialka and Zawrat. In my opinion, the level is at most average. As for boarding: breakfast ok , you can not complain but lunches already worse. Once there was good food another time I had the impression that I was eating soup from a bag :) 3 * and in the morning, before 8 . 00 woke me up with a tractor that was taking the ground under my window. The horror! ! ! ! In the evenings there was no one at the reception, there were no parking spaces. Part of the car park is a staircase covered with rocks, there were stairs leading to it, and after descending from them, at the lowest step a pipe protruded from the ground, so on the diameter of about 150, in the evening not illuminated, you could roll up the eagle: (Kids had a place to play, but let others say something about it. In the canteen you were served by a waitress alternating with Mr. Waiter. The guy tried his best, he was everywhere, reported, looked after, rolled up as if in the creek. Big words of appreciation! ! However, your waitress didn't seem to worry, she was working a little bit, although in fact, only once I got a chance, but it was in the pub when he wanted 'em before 22. I was told that I'm going to be closing soon and I can only take them to my room. There's no glass, glass, kettle, refrigerator in the room. Maybe I'm a nuisance, but lately I've been hitting on the floor like this, that this equipment was so standard! !"
2761,"We used the hotel during a few days' tour of Dresden. A hotel on the outskirts of town in a side street. Rooms without air-conditioning, but equipped with fans, which in the extreme heat allowed us to sleep peacefully at night. Standard breakfasts, just right. The reception staff is very friendly and willing to give any information. Near Lidl and public transport (tram), from where you can easily get to the center. We recommend to visit the city for a few days."
2762,"A beautiful building . Unfortunately, it is decorated in kitschy splendor and very unevenly. Nice wooden wardrobe in the room and dirty sofa next to it . Salt cave in the spa and paper door . It looks as if somebody in the middle of the investment lacked funds. Unfortunately, the service is poor. No towels for the spa ( they are in the room after all ) . I do not recommend because there are many nicer places in the region. The quality/price ratio is very weak. Good breakfast !"
2763,"I to Professor. Semczka did not hit me by accident . She went to him before she got pregnant so when she started expecting a baby it was natural for me to continue visiting him. Yes, it's a nice disposition and familiarity, but you can't deny him the pregnancy is about something else. The doctor almost every time I visit him, he has 3 the same tests, a referral to the ultrasound, which should be examined for the neck translucency, she got m too late, so she had a lot of unpleasantness, not to mention the stress she experienced. I have the impression that a specific test has to be done (I am in the 27th week of pregnancy and it was I who asked for a referral to the sugar curve because the doctor wasn't going to ask me to do the test) the test for toxoplasmosis should be done every three months and I only had to do it once during the first test. . ."
2764,"The doctor operated during my stay in the hospital (I had a procedure for L5 / S1 myself and here I bowed to the chief surgeon professor Ślósarek, who operated on me) in Arkona Street in Szczecin several people with whom he stayed in one room and saw what a hand of a super neurosurgeon can do, neck disks, lumbar stabilization, stabilization of the lumbar segments, after which patients on the second day after the procedure walked and felt good, returning feeling in their legs, passing the worst pain after sciatica (this pain would not wish me the worst enemy because I did not sleep through it myself for several weeks). A super doctor with a very good approach to patients, the hospital itself and the targeting nurses' care, the hospital really ""without pain"". Not for nothing one hears the opinion ""Divine Herbowski"" : )"
2765,"One evening I went with my friends to a restaurant that is in the Aquarius Hotel for dinner and a match. They ordered us pizzas and beer, beer ? but where to choose ? The restaurant, yes? One kind of beer imposed by the staff, but what next? the restaurant advertises itself and has no chef ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The pizza disaster was made by the receptionist, who seems to have a bar to serve, she cleans up, people this place is a disaster! ! ! ! ! !"
2766,"Rooms - standard weak 3 * service - level zero, the customer in the restaurant completely invisible, neither good morning nor goodbye, total lack of interest, you feel as if you are disturbing, the reception staff provides only residual and cursory information (e.g. asking for help in renting a car you get the answer; please look in the nearby rental shops). or provides information that is generally not completely reliable, such as bus timetables. The hotel has 3 bars, one of which is better. The staff is so unpleasant that they can ask for alcohol from another (neighboring) bar - all inclusive option: ) ) ) ) In the evenings a man sentenced to the main bar (trough), a place that resembles a waiting room at the bus station. Attractions: the main swimming pool - the most persistent man can survive 5 minutes in this noise, and a man with a book or looking for peace and quiet will not survive within 500 m due to the noise and confusion prevailing in the pool. There is also an Animator who makes the time of the holidaymakers by pulling them out of the lounger and encouraging them to make clowns with very loud music. Hotel restaurant ( noisy canteen ) - if someone likes pizza with fries is recommended - PLAZAZY I do not recommend to people with little demands I do not recommend to people looking for minimum comfort and peace . Terrible holidays with itaca ."
2767,"In the hotel, he spent 7 days in August with his family ( 2 + 1 ). I will start with the advantages because unfortunately there are less of them. . . The advantages : - the hotel is located near numerous shops and restaurants. You can easily and quickly get to other towns. - The hotel serves good food with quite a big choice. In any case, you can not complain about the catering. Of course there are small shortcomings as mentioned here already diluted fruit juices, but in the overall assessment it should not affect the reception of the kitchen served to guests, - the hotel staff is nice, cleaned daily, linen and towels are changed daily, cleanliness is taken care of. Now the disadvantages: - First of all, many rooms are at ground level and even below ground level. . I strongly advise against taking these locations, - secondly, the APX option, i.e. buying the apartment is some kind of mistake, from an ordinary room it differs only with a sliding curtain in the middle. . . this does not provide any independence after dividing a dozen or so meters long room with a sliding curtain does not change anything in terms of room separation, - thirdly, satellite TV is a fiction, 4 canals barely received, - the equipment in the rooms is already old, i.e. rusty fridge, old sink and generally old equipment, - animations in the hotel monotonous even boring, for children in the evening a few of the same songs sung day after day. . . for adults really not very high levels of performance or ball games in the pool. Evening ""shows"" last up to 23rd but are mercilessly loud. . . The kid could never fall asleep before 11 p.m. (although that's what he really wanted 'em to do :) - the hotel doesn't actually have a beach. . . . .because the lawn is 50 m away from the beach and the hotel cannot be called a beach. . . to a real beach about 150 m. Beach paid 3 euros per sunbed. The beach itself . . . . .well, I haven't seen 'em yet. . . . . .from 2 m wide to maybe 10 max. . . . .top two rows of deck chairs. . . . . ( ! ) and the sand is about 5 cm on the clay floor, also the child will not dig a hole: ) To sum up - the hotel deserves these 3 stars even for the food itself - it is a lot, good and actually all day long. Apartments are a joke and in my opinion they deserve a complaint. The whole as if from the 90s of these but clean. As far as my opinion is concerned, for this price - it is not worth it! I suggest you look for something else."
2768,"Two weeks before the visit, I made and paid the room to say that I wanted a deluxe with a baby bed. As it turned out I got a room with three single beds which the lady in the service joined in 1 claiming that they no longer have deluxe rooms with double beds, I wonder why they are on offer? The shower was damaged - no lighting, the heat was behind the seat, so in order to drip, I had to use an ordinary handset, no water regulation (very hot) and a few other cabin components, when the jacuzzi in the cabin was switched on, it started to stink. . . Poor food. I do not recommend!"
2769,"Is the doctor familiar with men's hormones, and can he help you with things like Tuesday hypogonadism? I wonder how easy it is to get to him when you have a referral to an endocrinologist from your family doctor? Is that not possible at all?"
2770,"The Orbis Hotel Group and its partner Accor are launching the Avanzi project. The project consists in the modernization of public space available in ibis hotels, increasing the comfort of guests' rest without changing the price of accommodation. In Poland, ibis Warsaw Old Town was the first to undergo renovations. Since April this year, guests can enjoy its new design. The Avanzi project aims to adjust the decor of ibis hotels to the changing expectations of customers. They are increasingly looking for modernity and their own style in hotel brands. Innovative design and the use of public space proposed in the Avanzi project, add cosiness to the interiors and create a homely atmosphere."
2771,"My opinion ( woman 62 ) and a brief summary of the consultation with Mr . dr . Yuriy Ksenyuk The doctor, after seeing the X-rays ( there was no MRI) of course noticed on 2 sections of the spine of the degeneration and made a short interview with the patient ( watching his back ) . After asking about MRI, we received a business card for this examination (with a discount) + a prescription for medicines (anti-inflammatory / muscle relaxation). When asked about the surgery schedule for this condition (e.g. discopathy, osteophytes, vertebral degeneration), we were informed about waiting for a few years (6 years) for this type of surgery (NHF). When asked that we could cover the cost of such an operation (without the doctor continuing to talk about it). There was not even a proposal for rehabilitation (from the doctor) in this respect. The advantages: - > price for the consultation is not exorbitant - > fast enrolment deadlines Minus: It is ""the doctor learns about the patient's condition, his problems and expectations and then presents a diagnosis and a plan of action"" . And the latter is what I missed. . . Dog . And from the comments one can wrongly conclude that there will be this ""light in the tunnel"" . . . Ps. . ."
2772,"The visit went too fast. The doctor made a diagnosis that surprised me a little bit, maybe I don't judge it right. In any case, it is normal that every patient because they hear the diagnosis would like to ask about certain issues, especially when they are strongly surprised by it. The doctor was obviously in a hurry and unfortunately he did not create an atmosphere in which I felt comfortable. She left me quite worried, with many unanswered questions."
2774,"I don't recommend this doctor either. I went to him after reading the positive comments, because as a person with AD I am looking for a good specialist . She threw me into the mud 150 PLN . The visit lasted maybe 5 minutes, the doctor was not too interested in what I have to say, he did not interview and in general he had a feeling that I am disturbing him, he looked at me and prescribed an ointment that did not help and the problem grew even more despite the doctor's assurances that up to 2 weeks everything will go away. When she showed me the prescribed ointment to the general practitioner, he was really surprised that she got it from the dermatologist."
2775,"Hello! I'm very sorry, but I don't recommend Dr. . Nowosielski ! ! ! Very uncommunicative! ! ! ! I have been reading my daddy's book on the Internet and consulting with another professor and with patients suffering from the same cancer all through the fight against cancer! It was from them that she found out the most about me! Then she remembered m and asked m Dr . Nowosielski, but with great reluctance and grace, she responded and sometimes adjusted to these indications. Mostly by chance, e.g. about additional medicines, therapies, etc., she stated that this would not help or that it was unnecessary! Anyway, since the beginning of the disease, she has been telling us negative things! And yet, the psyche is so important in treatment! ! ! They say that faith works wonders and we have kept it up, but every time the doctor managed to get us. My daddy is unfortunately already dead and that is why he wanted to warn others against this doctor because in my opinion the doctor should talk to the patient and their loved ones, mobilize them to fight and give them hope! And unfortunately, on the part of this doctor this GERMANY! ! ! I know that people suffering from cancer don't have what their dad had but why should they emphasize it on every visit! ! ! !"
2776,"She's beautiful and shiny. Interesting design . The downside is that everything is visible on its surface every pollen or drop . It would be good to polish it every day. Cleaning is made difficult by an interesting design - the unevenness in which the grids are embedded . Burner is a small hell . They heat up hard . Double is a flamethrower . Good for a large pot, but if you don't use the boiler it's impractical. Choosing the cooker a second time would give up the wok. Two medium burners even on the smallest fire heat quite strongly. The burners light up immediately, you do not have to hold the knob for 15 seconds, only about 2 - 3. It annoys me because it is dirty even when you do not use it. My wife likes it because it is black and beautiful."
2777,"Very cool coffee machine, unique design, ease of use, and super Latte. I admit that I bought it with a lot of uncertainty, there are practically no opinions about it on the Internet, it is impossible to see it anywhere, nor touch it, but I took em risk and ordered it in MALL for 2500, it's a very good price for this machine, I admit that I searched the whole world and nowhere do they sell it under 3000 in PLN. In fact, the company that produces it is KALERM, but it is called PHILCO, BORG, FEL, ZELMER, HENDI. I generally recommend this coffee maker, the coffee is tasty, hot and has a beautiful foam, very nice latte with one button. It froths the milk fantastically, the froth remains even after intense stirring. With the disadvantages, annoying is quite often the need to empty the drainer, but this is due to the frequent switching on and off of the machine in my case, once again I recommend, it is worth it."
2778,"Beautiful villa from outside and inside with a large garden. Many different rooms to move around . In some rooms you can find old and beautiful furniture. The room that we had was rented outside the villa. The room was large and spacious, the bed was very comfortable and well lit. We did not like the smell in the room. Sharp and not pleasant as if the humidity. You can see that the room was because it was freshly painted but still had an unpleasant smell of moisture. The bathroom was very small and therefore not comfortable. It was hard to move around in it. Breakfast was very good, quite a big choice of everything. Very good coffee and scrambled eggs with bacon and homemade cake. The service was quite nice. I recommend that you visit this place."
2779,"Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has set the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics Winter Olympic Games price cap at 14,000 roubles (about $464), reports "" Russia Now "", an online supplement to the British daily newspaper The Telegraph. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak explains that the event will be made more accessible to visitors by reducing prices, which in Sochi are normally rising by 30 to 40 percent at the tourist peak. And they reach up to 157,000 roubles ($5,200) per night. The decision of the Prime Minister will limit the prices paid during the Games for the deluxe suite in a 5-star hotel to 13 896 roubles (460 USD) . Single and double rooms will cost no more than 8,253 roubles ( 273 USD ) and 10,569 roubles ( 350 USD ) ."
2780,"A little crowded, because the hotel is connected to a car dealership with sensitive exhaust fumes, view from the window (cars, parking) breakfast - buffet for a small selection but tasty, beds very comfortable roller blinds on the windows large plus you can send well, bathroom without crazy lack of hairdryer, for 2 people room definitely too small difficult to move. The dishes with card in the restaurant very delicious applause for the chef! ! ! opposite a very nice park! ! !"
2781,"We came for the evening were booked spa treatments for an hour. 20 , your receptionist 2 hours before the massages informed that only on 22 or the next day of May time. A lot of disappointment on our part, because the fiancé had a birthday. Gift not fulfilled. Luckily, the trip to the Czech Republic compensated us for our unsuccessful stay in Margot. The pool and jacuzzi are rated in the plus, with service to change. . . The rooms are clean even though there is no revelation, the new part of the hotel has a strange smell and coolness in the rooms."
2782,"It was the second, but certainly not the last stay in a hotel that deserves five stars. The double room was clean, spacious, functionally furnished. Room service is excellent, willing to help if necessary and discreet. A great swimming pool complex, saunas, Jacuzzi. The brine pool in the evening with a lit up huge fireplace and delicate, atmospheric music is an unforgettable impression. The kitchen with a huge variety of delicious and varied dishes is a feast for the eyes and palate. It is worth to come with your child, because the hotel provides our kids with a lot of unforgettable experiences, games, etc.. We were just being part of the Halloween Ball: the party was frontal, lots of prizes, interestingly organized games. I strongly recommend: )"
2783,"He's been playing 'em in GTA since the 2nd part of this famous game came out. Frankly speaking, I was disappointed with 'em in San Andreas, but I wasn't delighted either. I played much more interestingly in Vice - city . . . maybe because of the plot or maybe because of this gloomy atmosphere in SA . The game overall good, quite interesting but does not attract to the computer for long. This is the only version where I did not want to return to the game after a short break. Currently, the price of GTA SA has fallen, so I think that those who wouldn't be able to play SA in the newer GTA 4 are not working. I recommend it in general, but not hot: P"
2784,"Meetings with Mr. Kamil in my case started early in the year. I don't like the stiff, office atmosphere or therapists who ostentatiously peek at the end of the conversation. That is why I am glad that there is a possibility to meet with a therapist in a more intimate space, over coffee, in a calm, normal, non-clerical atmosphere (this office gives me additional stress). We have several (maybe several) sessions behind us. What I personally liked the most are elements of provocative therapy, which Mr. Kamil in his sessions more and more often uses (who does not know - I encourage you to read about this topic, very brave and interesting way of conducting the therapy). There are no taboo subjects in these sessions - you can talk about everything honestly, touch on every problem. Another very important element of therapy with Mr. Kamil is the interaction. He is a man who listens actively, responds, explores the subject, is one hundred percent focused on what is happening in therapy (I have meetings with a therapist who sat like a peg and minutes of silence between us gave me a fever). To sum up, I highly recommend it. As you do not know how to say something, Mr. Kamil will find a way - in my case it was pouring some things on paper. There is another great advantage of this therapist - honesty. If Mr. Kamil sees that it is better that working on himself, he proposes to meet with less frequency."
2785,"She wanted me to be operated on by Dr. Dedecius because of his good reputation. After the first private visit, I was really satisfied. He talked to me in a nice and concrete way, he also performed a thyroid ultrasound. He also performed a thyroid ultrasound. She paid PLN 150 for the visit. The nice lady who made the appointment explained to me that this quite high cost is caused by this ultrasound. So my surprise was enormous when for the second visit, which lasted less than 5 minutes and consisted only in setting the date of the operation, she paid me exactly the same amount. She spent two days in the hospital. The doctor appeared literally a few minutes before the surgery and gave her permission to perform the operation. He didn't explain anything, he didn't talk and what's worse, he didn't get acquainted with the results of the last tests. I was waiting for a few hours for the final decision about the operation to finally hear ""We will have to say goodbye"". He may be a good surgeon, but I, due to the lack of professionalism of the doctor, did not have the opportunity to find out about it."
2786,"She's already written me an opinion on this invention but I see she's gone. I do not recommend it! If there's something to everything, it's not good. It is heavy, you have to be careful with furniture because it is hard to drive and there are no covers on plastic. The foot is very high so it is impossible to drive under the furniture on your feet. On the stairs, vacuuming and washing is not possible! There is no ordinary cable reel and you have to maneuver with a long cable . A long cable is a plus. It must have been designed by some guy who has no idea about house cleaning ."
2787,"The Doctor's making a good impression, but that's all. She was treated for 3 months for recurring inflammations, which she finally managed to control, but it turned out that the cause is erosion. After 2 months of her "" treatment "" When everything was supposed to be okay, she went to another doctor for a consultation where it turned out that the erosion was not cured at all. She lost a lot of money during these few months and the effect is that she returned to her initial state of health. I do not recommend it! Besides this minus is also the wholesale treatment of patients, strange comments and not very clear explanation of the causes of health and treatment. She trusted m her because she had good opinions and therefore she did not listen to my intuition and continued to treat me. As you can see, it was a mistake."
2788,"Vision Hotel Management is a new company on the hotel market, belonging to the PUHIT SA chain, whose task is to manage hotels operating within international chains. The management process will be conducted in cooperation with investors and developers who decide to engage in the construction of such facilities. Despite its short activity, the company is already conducting first negotiations. In principle, Vision Hotel Management Sp . z o.o. is not a new entity, because the company was registered as early as 2004, but PUHIT decided to activate it in order to improve hotel management. PUHIT SA was established in 2007 as a result of the transformation of a former state-owned enterprise dealing with the operation of workers' hotels. Currently, the company operates 7 hotels (4 in Warsaw, 3 in Kraków) offering a total of over 1,1 thousand rooms, 3 of which operate under the Best Western brand."
2789,"The great knowledge, the accuracy of the interview and ultrasound examination, a noticeable willingness to help the patient and empathy are the first things you feel during your visit to the doctor. Personal culture and great contact with the patient. I underwent stem cell treatment after my tibial tendonitis. The treatment was unpleasant and painful. The pain I had to deal with non-stop for many weeks, when every step, movement of my foot was painful - it made me able to endure the unpleasant feeling of the procedure. The doctor was very gentle at the start of the procedure - and at the same time, she was determined and confident in carrying out everything to the end. Now I am waiting for the results for about 6 weeks. After a follow-up visit I will write about the results."
2790,"I agree with the opinion below ! ! ! I had this unpleasantness to experience it on my own skin, I was hospitalized in Piaseczno a week ago with a dead pregnancy (my second miscarriage was in January this year too). The doctor gave me an ultrasound, she was terribly nervous that I was crying. It is known that for every woman a miscarriage is a traumatic experience and it was my second miscarriage this year, now a twin pregnancy! ! I was given powders after which she was supposed to save me, in the morning the doctor asks me if she saved me (how should I know, after all, she is a doctor) She gave me an ultrasound and it was stated that she did not save me and that it is necessary to do the procedure. . . when she asked me if if if it happened to me the second time, maybe she should do some tests, the doctor said that she did not, that if I miscarry the third time, it was then. . . . ...ok it's time for the surgery. . . . .when they tried to put me to sleep I was very nervous and she was crying when the anesthesiologist tried to calm me down just before I went to sleep she heard the doctor say that now it's no longer necessary to cry, girl. . . . .I was woken up from anaesthesia, my stomach hurt terribly, I was given an IV and said I was going home. . . . .but I was still feeling bad all the time. . . . . ...she got a fever. . ...the next powders, the midwife said she didn't know what to do with me. . . . .then I was given another drip and powders and discharged home. After the surgery, the doctor didn't even bother me because why should I be interested in my patients how to drink coffee at that time! ! ! What is more, the procedure was about 12 o'clock and the discharge from the hospital was ready: ) there are no test results on the discharge, not even the exact age of pregnancy and it is written that it is a twin pregnancy! (Comparing to my previous stay in the hospital with the previous procedure). I will add that I needed a visit of a psychologist but our hospital in Piaseczno does not have one! After a week of my very bad mood, I went to see a doctor and it turned out that despite what I have been through, I have not been completely cured, I have an infection and the procedure must be repeated. . . and so today she had to measure the treatment again and suffer again! Thank you very much and I do not recommend it !"
2791,"Two classes of rooms with the same price - half of the crew lived in normal conditions, such rooms can be seen on the hotel's website. The second half of the rooms are like from a sports camp, in the 90s. I had a dubious pleasure to live in the second class - problems with heating (either cold or sauna). Dark, 25w light bulbs? Bathroom in standard below the hostel. Shower cabin for children . Terribly uncomfortable beds, on mattresses, under a sheet - a cape! Nice service, matching clothes ""behind the bar"" while placing an order. For the lady at the reception desk it was unthinkable to solve the problem of too small a bed for a person with a height of 200cm - ""at the end of the pot"" she will not help, because during the reservation no one warned that someone will be tall"". . . I leave the evaluation of such a position to you. Nasty breakfasts, ""juice"" did not even stand next to the fruit, delicious ""ovary"" with powder. After ordering an egg judged for breakfast, after 30min we gave up eating out. It seems to be a coffee maker, but it is better not to touch it! ! Delicious lunches, but not in a hotel but in a nearby pub! ! ( And the prices are lower than in the hotel!) ."
2792,"In the last few decades, more people have died in hospitals or hospices. According to the data of the Central Statistical Office (GUS), in 1980 42.7% of people died in a hospital, 0.5% in another health care institution; 49.1% of the deaths occurred at home. After 30 years, these proportions changed significantly, among other things, due to long-term treatment processes in hospitals. In 2011 as many as 50.6% of deaths occurred in hospitals, 6.6% in other institutions (mainly in hospices) and 37% at home. Thus, the burden of family care for the dying was reduced. At the same time it may be suspected that as a result of the natural disappearance, in past historical periods, the ""taming of death"" mental stress resulting from the loss of a loved one has not decreased, but on the contrary is increasing."
2793,"Today, some cases are referred for treatment abroad. Specialists from Zabrze calculated that there such surgeries are at least twice as expensive as in Poland, where the real average cost of treatment and lung transplantation in a patient with cystic fibrosis (as in the case of 17-year-old Michał) was calculated to be approx. The real average cost of treatment and lung transplantation in a patient with Cystic Fibrosis (as in the case of 17-year-old Michał) was calculated at ca. 350 thousand PLN and in a patient with extreme pulmonary hypertension (as in the case of 15-year-old Marta) at ca. . 320 thousand PLN . In both cases the Ministry of Health decided to cover the actual costs, although if the standard appraisals were followed, this would be much less. The Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases in Zabrze is the leader of chest organ transplantation in Poland, both heart and lung. Apart from the centre in Zabrze, only the centre in Szczecin, headed by Professor Tomasz Grodzki, has performed two successful lung transplants in patients with emphysema."
2794,"She stayed in this hotel in December 2012. Unfortunately, a total failure . The staff was not nice, the waiters behaved as if someone forced them to work. The food was monotonous, processed from lunch to dinner, etc . And the biggest surprise was the paid drinks for meals, even if you bought a package with 3 meals. The swimming pool is partially renovated, the attractions for weak children. The only advantage is the large rooms, but they would require refreshment. Definitely not adequate quality to the exorbitant price. I'll add that I have already visited several hotels in Poland so I have a comparison. I advise you to avoid from far away."
2795,"Probably the biggest advantage of the hotel is its location - close to the sea as well as to the center of Faliraki. The rooms are neat and reasonably clean (towels changed). The dryers were supposed to be in the room, there were no dryers in our room. We asked the Lord from the reception desk about it, but he did not report it all week. The hotel staff was medium. Some of the rooms are located in a different building than the reception desk and restaurant (across the street). There is absolutely nothing going on at the hotel after lunch, the music for lunch during the week's stay was played twice. Air conditioning paid 7 euros per day, and wifi 5 euros per day. Meals and cleanliness in the restaurant leave a lot to be desired (food trays smelled awful, oil and spices standing on the table dirty). Breakfast would still be okay if it wasn't for the fact that even butter couldn't give, only margarine. . . There was no fresh bread, so we ate toast every day. Dinners a little better, but the taste of the food is medium, Hotel definitely for older people. We left the hotel at 5:30, so we didn't even have a key where to leave it, because the hotel was closed (we lived across the street), not to mention the take-away breakfast. . . In general it is possible to survive, but it is really better to pay a little bit more and have a better standard and not pay for air-conditioning and wifi."
2796,"The INTER BUSINESS Hotel is located in Bucharest's business and commercial district. It offers spacious rooms with air conditioning, free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TV. It is a 3-minute walk from the underground station. There is a supermarket and a shopping centre nearby. A total misunderstanding was the breakfast buffet served on the cold heaters, the dishes are not tasty and cold tea has reached its maximum. 3 ."
2797,"The hotel was a stopover on the journey from Italy to Paris, it is located just off the road, easy to find, private parking, large. The room is clean, quite large. The only surprise is the bathroom, which looks like a cabin on a ferry - very tight and all plastic. For French conditions, the room is quite cheap, worth its price."
2798,"I guess enough advertising of this hotel will be a sentence that for a supposedly romantic dinner and by candlelight we waited more than an hour and a half from the moment of order, and for the order itself more than 20 minutes. (as understood by the staff, a romantic dinner is a pork with potatoes and the candlelight was a cartridge for candles)."
2799,"A Galician town where you can stay overnight, eat well and see what the towns in Galicia once looked like. The layout of the buildings forms the structure of a small town concentrated around the town hall and market square. Various craftsmen have been recreated. You can buy handicraft products. The restaurant serves regional and local dishes as well as local beers and stronger liquors, including plum brandy: ) Free, lockable parking, fast Wi - Fi . Rooms are stylish and comfortable . Recommended !"
2800,"Ewa Błaszczyk said that during her daughter's surgery she took care of the ""Alarm clock"" clinic for adults. ""This is the best thing she could do while waiting,"" she added. Before her daughter's surgery the actress said that she was aware that Ola has been in a coma for 16 years ""which is a burden"" but she added that she would rather hope than not have it. Prof. Morita came to Olsztyn after he got to know the achievements of the Ewa Błaszczyk ""Akogo"" foundation and became acquainted with the activities of Prof. Maksymowicz and his team during the autumn scientific conference in Warsaw. Moved by the care of people in coma, Professor Morita declared his help to the Poles and agreed to carry out the first four treatments free of charge."
2801,"The owners of the hotel are very unpleasant, it would seem that they are doing everything from the unwanted. As far as breakfasts are concerned, identical daily, it includes: one slice of cheese, one disgusting salsa, small portions of butter, marmalade, two slices of test bread and an orange. As far as the rooms are concerned, I just found myself with a non-smoking toilet cistern. Despite several times reporting a problem at the reception, nothing worked at all. After 5 days of stay and a complaint we sent to the resident, we were offered to change the room, because probably because of the end of the season it didn't pay to fix it. I definitely do not recommend it."
2802,"The visit was quick, the doctor was a bit annoyed by my long trouser that bothered her here and there, and you could look at it with humour. The factual and automatically efficient terms come to mind. The visit was a routine examination, so I am not able to assess the competence, but I met with a more pleasant and gentle treatment. On the other hand, the doctor's pragmatic approach certainly prevents the construction of too long queues. To sum up, I have nothing to complain about, and with the ise dogs I will stop."
2803,"Full profession from the reception desk to the waiters, SPA, not forgetting those who care about cleanliness. This one sentence contains everything. It's a pleasure to write about the facility just superlatives. I don't know what the season is like, but in my humble opinion professionalism is independent of the season."
2804,"I advise against anyone planning to stay in this hotel completely ! ! ! It was supposed to be a beautiful and romantic Valentine's Day weekend. Getting to the place - drama . We arrived late. The road was completely unlit, full of holes. Not a single free parinh place. The car on the car . Nightmare . No person responsible for piloting the cars or even the object itself. There were no cameras in any hallway. The first fire was filled with cigarette smoke on the stairs . The room on the second floor seemed ok at first sight. Only on the first floor. On the balcony, an empty bottle of alcohol and cigarettes. After leaving the luggage, we went to dinner served in 3 minutes, heated up. After that we went bowling. A nightmare track. 3 crutches on the cross, two tracks running. The curve track is not even. The balls were flying and made it impossible to play any more. After the bowling we wanted to refresh ourselves as it turned out there was no warmer water! ! ! ! They asked us why you assured us that it would be so until the day we left. Although the reception desk provided hot water every hour. After an unsuccessful attempt, we went down to the disco, where for 2 drinks, you wanted 30 PLN. Like in a luxury bar. Laughter in the hall. . . Breakfast was pretty good. When we came back, our door card didn't work. . . In cable TV, 4 channels. . . . Drama . . . Cobweb on the walls . . . . Scratched couches . . . . Billiard nightmare. . . And the pool. . . A mini pool where it smelled, and what's most interesting, not even chlorine that wasn't there. . . . In addition, the jacuzzi that was in the price of the groupon was smashed, and not lit up including the showers. No lifeguard at the pool nightmare. Dinner was the same as the day before. Warmed up? On the day we left, because we came with the dog, you expected to pay for the dog. They openly told us that we would not pay because the stay was annoying and nightmarish. The lady suggested to us a lie that the hot water was not there. Where the most interesting thing was that she read in my opinion that the problem is at least half of last year! ! ! ! The hotel above the inscription has 3 stars stuck. Coincidence? I don't think so."
2805,"A nice greeting - a gift and a basket with a saint's basket . The hotel is nice, but completely unprepared to welcome guests on the occasion of Easter 2016. Breakfast is simple, simple - not Christmas at all and only a symbolic amount of Christmas mazurka. Dinner is not very tasty, no choice. Very good coffee for dinner and a nice lady from the restaurant staff. A fatal impression. Christmas Eve 2015 we spent in the Kossak Hotel and were great - you have someone to learn from."
2806,"The doctor is late and then in such a hurry to serve the patients that he almost forcefully pushes them out of the office. The rush results in the doctor watching the patient briefly, quickly informing him how much to pay, opening the door and saying: ""Goodbye."" The patient leaves without a diagnosis and treatment, but is very disappointed with the doctor's treatment. I sincerely advise against visiting this doctor."
2807,"Ideal for tourists who want to visit the historical part of Istanbul and feel the climate of this part of the city. A great location for these purposes in the Sultanahmet district: a 10-minute walk to the Hippodrome, the so-called Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Camii) and the Hagia Sophia Temple, from there a piece to the Topkapı Palace; the other way round, 2 minutes to the Constantine Column (Çemberlitaş) and the tram stop of the same name. There are many souvenir shops, cafes, restaurants with good kebabs and kofte. The nearby small mosque makes it necessary to get used to the calls of the muezzin in the early hours of the morning, but you can get used to it; ) An ideal location for evening walks in Sultanahmet, when you can feel the specific, magical atmosphere of this part of town. The location is worse if the goal is to get to know the nightlife of Istanbul - the Taksim district is far away and the access is not easy, the more so as the trams and subways end up quite early and taxis are not cheap. There aren't really any pubs nearby, there aren't many in the whole district. The hotel service is nice and helpful. Wi-fi only works in the common room downstairs, but the signal is strong and no problems - ask for your own login and password at the reception. With a friend she lived in a double room - no revelation. A tiny room, two power sockets, no table, a broken knob on the door (but it worked.)) but the beds are comfortable, the linen is clean. The closet is small, actually we kept our things in suitcases. The view from the window on some nasty backyard, but living on Sultanahmet you shouldn't stay in the hostel rooms long so it doesn't matter. Perhaps the other rooms are better with a view. You can hear noises from the corridor, but if you don't have a large and noisy group it shouldn't bother you. The shared bathroom is clean but uncomfortable with three lockable showers, three toilets (also lockable) and washbasins. You have to check if the windows are open and close before the shower, at least in February ; ) Breakfast type Swedish table, monotonous - every day the same (Turkish breakfast so olives, white cheese in several types, bread, cheese, yellow cheese, etc . of course different butter, jam and honey in typical small boxes). ...unlimited distance to coffee and tea. For those who require variety, there is also a small stove where you can prepare, cook and store something in the fridge. Generally - I recommend it for short stays for tourists. For a longer stay the lack of a table, a decent wardrobe and a bathroom in the room would be much more burdensome."
2808,"I have no idea why there are so many good opinions about this doctor - in my opinion - and I know what I am saying because I have been on several visits to the clinic on jasmine - he is mainly a doctor - arrogant - conceited and unfortunately does not treat well, and the gastroscopy he did - it's a failure - I wanted to write a complaint on him, but my friends advised me to stay calm - because it's just nerves - my nerves, of course - and his hair won't fall off - I won't go there anymore - I'll try to heal elsewhere"
2809,"An excellent specialist - we have been under Doctor's care for 5 months. The examination lasts almost an hour - the daughter is now 7 months old, so it is not easy to deal with such a tiny child and the Doctor is doing great. She talks to the child, smiles, but also conducts a thorough examination and describes to the parent what she noticed. Frankly speaking, she has only now read the opinions in this forum and I am very surprised by them. For me she is a great specialist - yes, she requires cooperation from the parent, she points out mistakes in development - but I think that's what this profession is about. I recommend!"
2810,"Alicia reported to me with a problem that was disturbing my daily life. Alice quickly diagnosed my problem-it was OCD, which was the first time she had ever heard of it. Alicia told me all about the disorder and after her first visit to the office she felt much better. Thanks to your commitment, showing understanding and explaining certain things to me, you made everything colorful and not just black. I know that I still have some work to do, but I can safely say that with every visit to your office, my problem has been diminishing. Mrs. Alicia, I am really grateful to you, because now I am again the same, cheerful and smiling girl! Thank you very much !"
2811,"With the opinion I waited until I could also assess the effects of the treatment and not the visit itself. Unfortunately my opinion is not very flattering. . . The price of the visit is well known to everyone, so I have no problem with that, however, when paying for the visit I count on decent care, a thorough examination, some advice and of course effective treatment. Unfortunately it was completely different. My visit lasted only 10 minutes, the examination was done very briefly (never in my life, no gynecologist has examined me so briefly. . . ) and the chosen treatment? Unfortunately, it did not give any results. My infection after eight days of taking globules and spending 200 PLN is still present. The only plus for testing the vaginal pH, because it has not yet met with m . . . ."

Yes Basis of assessment in the index / credit: 2 colloquia, no negotiations Unexpected: no sense of humour General approach to the student: neutral General assessment: 4 (1 - 5) Tasks on colloquia as in the script, strictly adheres to the rules, even as far as consulation deadlines are concerned, one minute after that it does not accept ; )"
2813,"He's not an angel, he's a bad man! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! My beloved son fought against cancer (NEUROBLASTOMA) after three months of treatment in oncology he died, the Chief Executive stated that the children after the infections are also leaving, in my opinion it is her fault. This woman has no approach to the children, let alone to the parents, she was able to criticize, insult and humiliate, and it is us parents who fight together with the children with this severe disease. My son only survived 22 months, and he's gone, does this woman know what we're going through, how we're going to live without him now, the ANIOL is my son, not her."
2814,"The worst holiday for any was m . The price is inadequate to the conditions . Everywhere dirty, no basic equipment . Furniture in disarray , dangerous equipment , children's fear to let out of sight . Despite assurances of lack of attractions . Incompetent service, lack of information . The rope park has not worked for years, so has the fountain, footbridge, fitness room. Stinking yakuzzi, the rooms are dirty. Holiday package in this complex is a scam."
2815,"I didn't have the pleasure of being a hotel guest, but I had lunch in the restaurant by the hotel. When ordering flat white coffee she got a latte, the outraged waitress said that she got a ""coffee with milk"". She asked me if I was sure they were making flat white in this way, the waitress assured me that they were. She said that the latte coffee was on the bill. . . . After the next coffee, unfortunately, you had to bother yourself because none of the waiters would come up to the table. After getting the bill, we waited a good 15 minutes until the waiter came to pick up the payment. Maybe it is not a big mistake and going in the restaurant was okay, but the waiters were extremely rude and rude so the overall rating is extremely weak. . . . .very unrecommended for this place because of the service."
2816,"We were on winter holidays 2017 in one of the most expensive rooms in the hotel. It was an apartment with two bathrooms. The maids were very poorly cleaning the rooms, it still stinks at the reception. The only thing we remember nicely is the service in the bar downstairs. Very nice bartenders"
2817,"Armani , Versce , Ferragamo , Missoni , Bulgari are already, but soon other brands associated primarily with the world of fashion, including Fashion TV, will also begin to function as hotel brands. The most important thing is that for life style hotels, which are becoming more and more popular on the accommodation market, a marriage (what - branding) with fashion houses seems natural and profitable. Although certainly not everyday. Owners and operators call emerging hotel chains with a label ""collections"". as well as subsequent editions of clothes presented on the world catwalks. Because such objects, just as they are supposed to be exceptional, unique. Today there are only a dozen or so of them, but they operate on four continents and have ambitious expansion plans. Leading hotel chains are more and more willing to marry well-known clothing designers and see this option as another niche to develop."
2818,"I don't recommend it. The doctor asked her a question about her past illnesses and without waiting for an answer she got up and started looking for a leaflet, after which she said ""Please read to yourself"", she threw two sentences without even looking at her face (she came with acne) and then she prescribed me drugs without really explaining what their purpose is and what their effects are. She also suggested doing some tests for hormones, adding that the gynaecologist will explain everything to me because it is not her problem (acne can be caused by them, so I think she should have a minimal idea about it). After 10 minutes in the office, she asked how she arranged for me to visit her when she answered me through the page A famous doctor where the price of the consultation is 100 PLN said that I pay 120 PLN because she did not call me straight to the reception. She had the impression that the doctor had no time and wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible."
2819,"Good morning. Actually, I have 2 different opinions about Dr Wolski: 1 in the private office - a sensational visit, 2 in the hospital - a nightmare: no interest on the part of the doctor, no information about the surgery, no history (unless the doctor has such a great memory and knows what the patient is reporting with and what is her medical history). The examination, or rather a mega painful ultrasound (she wanted to get off the chair and go home). Even the consent for the operation the doctor didn't take only the midwife (which is unacceptable because the consent for the operation has to be signed by the doctor who interviewed us) and the signed paper had to be taken by myself to the doctor. Finally, the doctor had to respect the patient's intimacy during the examination and not talk and joke with another doctor about irrelevant things not related to me at this point."
2820,"I'll skip the fact that Mr. Dr. had a time slip of 1.5 hours. . . . .difficult, it happens. She needed a quick and competent medical consultation, but I was disappointed. The doctor first wrote me a prescription, which I needed for the time being, and I was in Poznań and I did not have access to my gin, and he wanted 200 PLN for it! The man didn't see me in front of his eyes because his secretary gave me a note. . . He called me back that I was to appear soon, because the price of prescription is the whole range of services. So she appeared to me a few days later and she didn't find out anything, because Mr. Dr. showed great unprofessionalism. She told me more about problems and complications than he did to me. . . He was late so he was in a hurry, which made the examination unpleasant, he didn't want to talk to me. The ultrasound alone lasted 30 seconds. . . . . .he didn't examine the breasts, he didn't ask for a cytology. . . . .generally not recommended. After the whole visit, which lasted maybe 7 minutes, he mentioned something about further costs for this visit, but I am not a person who lets himself be pushed into the dark. . . Ah. . . . .to make her forget me. He was not able to answer my questions on the basis of an ultrasound, he was very outraged, and in the meantime he proposed a method completely unnecessary in my case, the costs of which are broken down by hundreds of zlotys. . . At the end he threw me out of the office, because he thought that if it did not meet my expectations, goodbye. It should only add that I am a calm and composed person, who does not start any brawls, and I think I should . . . ."
2821,"I have a hair loss problem. For a long time I have been doing a lot of tests which show that I am healthy, only this loss on my head. . . . So most doctors have sent me away with nothing from the dermatologist, endocrinologist and gynaecologist. And so after 2 months I was referred to a doctor. He turned out to be a very specific person. . . He read the results and offered me a cheaper treatment to first check if by chance we couldn't remove my problem without expensive intervention in my scalp. We will see if the diagnosis was correct and in a month's time, the earliest I can get to your doctor. Nevertheless, I applaud you for your honesty towards the patient."
2822,"For now, it is difficult to say anything about the treatment itself, because I got a referral for research and only based on the results will there be a diagnosis and recommendations. The visit was unfortunately delayed. The doctor was kind, kind, interested in the patient, conducted a detailed interview and examination of the skin lesions. I hope he will be able to help me."
2823,"Mr. Jaroslaw Cywiński ""took care of"" me from 7 to 8 years ago. In my opinion, he is an eminent proctologist and a wonderful nice and cordial man. Mr. Dr. J . Mr. Cywiński at the Adam Mickiewicz Hospital. Mr. J. Cywiński at the Pirogowa Hospital in Łódź removed polyps from my rectum. He was informed by phone about the date of surgery depending on the place in the hospital. Surgical procedures were always preceded by comprehensive and detailed examinations and thoroughly described to me (and even illustrated with the help of colorful board hanging on the wall in the office). After the surgery during the period of convalescence at home, I could get a consultation over the phone and answer all the questions about changing the dressings, etc., and then I was already coming to the control tests for ""MEDAX"". For many years now (knock on the door!) I do not feel any ailments and when I walked through Zielona Street I remember Dr. Jaroslaw Cywinski with sentiment and gratitude, his kindness, materiality and ... . the knock on the keys of his typewriter . And thinking about those undisputed crowds swarming in the corridor under the office, I believe that among them there is a huge crowd of grateful for the heart and professional help of patients. ( tsd )"
2824,"Villa Raj (one of the three owner's facilities), PLUSY: location - everywhere close, but at the same time relatively quiet, the facility - a beautiful house, wonderfully equipped, clean, functional, here they perform treatments (no need to run with a net, bathrobe, flip-flops to other facilities). Here, meals are served (you don't have to go hungry no matter what the weather is like), nice service both for ladies ""at the restaurant"" and ""at the treatments"". MINUSES: It wasn't possible to pay by card (despite the information we received on the phone when booking a room), food - despite the fact that there is information that there are dinners - nothing more wrong, soup, second course and compote. The meals are tasty, yes, but I must admit that it is hard to eat them, tiny portions, thin, lean, rather a sanatorium diet, I do not know how the men were enjoying themselves there (and there are some treatments) - first of all: pay attention to the prices quoted by the Doctor (owner). Differences of type - for this treatment you will pay 30zł, in the office I find out that I pay 170zł, secondly: attention to the duration of the treatment (e.g. . At the consultation we were told that the treatment lasts 1, 5 hours, and in the office of Mrs. Cosmetics thank you after 40 minutes, another situation on the massage - Mrs. Masseuse after 40 minutes of massage is surprised by my statement that the consultation with the owner of the treatment was to last one hour, so we both feel embarrassed by the situation ... thirdly: after arrival, you can not make an appointment at the Reception for treatments that you have looked for yourself, you have to go through the so-called. Medical consultation with the owner. And I warn you - you have to have really strong nerves to survive this - wait, then to digest all the ""friendly"" information about yourself and finally do not let yourself be manipulated into a given treatment. The general assessment - a super object, the staff try, but by ""cutting"" the time of treatments and the rapid price changes, we feel cheated. Perhaps through his own fault, because we did not watch out for something, but on the other hand, the man is going to the SPA to be taken care of and not to pay attention to the masseuse that the massage was to last 30 minutes and cut me 4 minutes at the beginning and 4 at the end - it is humiliating ..."
2825,"A decent price for a pseudo-mill, small and quite pretty appearance. However, this is where the advantages end. Bought 'em together with a flask coffee maker. I was deceived by the brand. Unfortunately, the grinding effects are mediocre: even at the lowest grinding level, the coffee is not suitable for the machine. Besides, they had a very uneven surface - some of the ground beans are thick, some of them will give you dust. To sum up, it may be suitable for brewing a decoction or non-pressurized brewing methods, but it is not suitable for coffee from a machine or in Turkish."
2826,"I visited this facility during this year's winter holidays. The main goal is laser therapy or ultrasound. The hotel is a facility from the communist times - renovated, but still feel the "" the "" climate. Some of the rooms are completely renovated and can be recognized by the new entrance door. Restaurant and sanatorium-style meals. Polish cuisine . On-site sauna, gym, fitness. In addition, a café with a pool table . Close to the beach and the aquapark. In the winter season in the area of the hollow and silence. In summer it is probably completely different. Generally, I recommend for medium demanding and not expecting luxuries (especially because the prices are low)."
2827,"The hotel is located in the center of Licheń, to the Basilica and the entire sanctuary just walk to the other side of the street. From the central side the hotel is located directly by the lake. Rooms are cozy and clean, the only drawback is the lack of a double bed in the apartment. Instead, there are two separate rooms that slip apart. The food in the restaurant is very good. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful."
2828,"""The promotion of the country on the occasion of Euro 2012 may accelerate the growth dynamics of the number of tourists by 1 percentage point per year,"" said Krzysztof Łopaciński, vice-president of the Institute of Tourism in an interview with the Polish Press Agency. In his opinion, without a football event, the annual increase in the number of tourists in the coming years could reach 3% per year. However, if further promotion, reminiscent of the Euro, is added to the promotion related to the Euro, this increase to 2017 - 2018 will amount to 4% per year. Krzysztof Łopaciński predicts that this year 14.4 million foreign tourists will visit Poland (in 2011 there were 13.4 million of them), which is 1 million more than a year ago. Taking into account the forecast, it can be expected that thanks to the Euro and the promotion of the event in the following years, an additional 144 thousand tourists will come to Poland in 2013 (out of a total of 15 million), and in 2014 an additional 155 thousand. The forecast is based on the Euro and the promotion of the event in 2013, and it can be expected that thanks to the Euro and the promotion of the event in 2013, an additional 144,000 tourists will come to Poland in 2013 (for a total of 15 million), and an additional 155,000 in 2014 (for a total of 15 million)."

It is worth it ."
2830,"We slept in Ibis for a few nights with our less than a year old, crawling son. It's good that the weather was fine and we were only staying at night in the hotel, because it would be hard to spend a few hours during the day. The hotel has a rather business profile (accommodation during the weekend is cheaper here than during the week), so the rooms are quite cramped (in ours after inserting a cot and a pram there was not much place to stand. . . ) . In this situation, the fact that there is linoleum on the floor (and not, for example, a carpet) does not make any difference to a small child - there is nowhere else to lay out toys or to crawl anyway. Beware of hotel ""pens"" - they are simply dangerous for toddlers ( I enclose a photo ) . No baby bathtub can be rented on site. The child does not get his own towel either (although we took his own from home anyway). Breakfast at the hotel - very expensive (36 PLN per person), and medium. Products such as sausages or canned ham, scrambled eggs, which look like made of powder (and not fresh eggs). . . For a lower price you can have a delicious and nutritious breakfast in nearby pubs (which we also did). The advantages are that the room and the bathroom were clean (so much so that the young man was able to bathe in the shower tray without any resistance), and the location of the hotel is very good - a tram stop at the door, a few minutes walk on the subway. Dinner in the hotel restaurant tasty (much better than breakfast)."
2831,"Great doctor! If it weren't for P . Caroline's braces would have worn me to this day, and I've been wearing them for 2 years now. The doctor took me under her ""wings"" from another incompetent doctor. It's a miracle that she agreed to correct a failed job for someone. . . . .for that great thanks to the atmosphere in the office sensational, you can relax by looking at the beautiful landscapes that are displayed on the ceiling. The ladies at the reception desk are very friendly and helpful. I guess I don't have to mention the doctor's office, a sensational, competent, friendly woman I recommend the office to everyone. Greetings to the entire staff. Natalia Rynkiewicz"
2832,"Quiet, pleasant rooms. Breakfast is quite good. Nice receptionists . WiFi free of charge . The only thing you can attach to - is the work of the cleaning ladies - lived in the hotel for a week - not once has the bed linen or vacuumed carpet been changed. Hotel parking "" under the cloud "" for 25 PLN per day: / /"
2833,"The hotel is well located, it can be a problem to park your car to bring your suitcases and download a card that allows you to enter the garage. . We found a room overlooking the wall of the old building and the lady at the reception told us that this is a room with the best view and with no better. It turned out that the air conditioning in the room only cools, the underfloor heating in the bathroom does not work. They changed our room (bigger, with nicer view but it was available) plus we got an electric heater. At the reception desk there is a nice area with sofas, where you can use the coffee machine with good coffee, tea, chocolate for free. . The hotel boasts that you can rent bikes there for free. It turned out that the bikes are only four. They cannot be booked in advance. They asked the lady at the reception to call us when the bikes were free and we went to visit the city. After some time, they called us at the hotel and told us that the bikes were available. They came to us in a few minutes and there were no bikes, supposedly for a long time. . . . .joking, bad organization? The beds in the rooms are very soft and quite narrow, sleeping not very well. ."
2834,"My husband and I spent one day at the hotel and in fact the arrangement of the hotel and the decorations are already very impressive from the entrance. The surroundings are also beautiful. Even in such a short time you can relax and unwind here. The ladies at the reception desk are very nice. In front of the hotel you can sit down and have a drink or coffee, there are also very comfortable sofas in the hotel lobby. Unfortunately, the restaurant services were not used by us, so I cannot say anything about it. The breakfast, on the other hand, was very varied and tasty. There is really something to choose from. Upon arrival, we went to the swimming pool, very neat maybe not huge but also not the smallest one, compared to other hotels. There is also plenty of room for the little ones in a separate pool and paddling pool with a slide. A big plus is a really big jacuzzi where you don't have to push yourself with others like sardines. It can easily accommodate 6-8 people. The saunas are also spacious, the only downside to this zone was that not all showers such as the ""tropical rain"" type are working. From the pool you can go outside where there are also loungers. The rooms are very bright and spacious, a comfortable bed, a bathroom of considerable size. The only thing that alienated me a little bit was the cleanliness of the floor in the cloakroom and swimming pool changing rooms and the windowsills in our room where probably the last guests left empty mineral water bottles and papers. But the trip was successful ! We highly recommend !"
2835,"As he explains, nanocellulose is currently not used in medical practice, but there is ongoing research into its formulation and various applications. For example, the Technical University of Lodz is conducting research on bacterial nanocellulose (one of the ways of its production). After cleaning, the finished material is obtained in the form of a dressing - a membrane or film. In Bydgoszcz, hydrated gel is produced from powdered cellulose. ""I very much hope that this invention will be able to introduce it to the market, because it can help many people in the treatment of wounds. For the clinical trials it would be necessary to increase the scale of the undertaking and cooperation with a pharmaceutical company. For the time being, it is not this stage yet, laboratory tests are still in progress"" - points out Karol Bocian."
2836,"The doctor made me a TV service on Malczewski ( NFZ ). She was rather cool, but nice. She didn't rush me, she answered my questions briefly and in a matter of fact. She was very gentle in her research. She was a little afraid of him, but she asked me and it was quickly over."
2837,"It is a person who is able to combine purely theoretical data and his or her life experience during the diagnostic process and the diagnosis is not only a medical term but the result of an in-depth analysis (something that means something to the patient). Not only does he know how to listen, he knows how to advise against what other psychiatrists are so defending themselves against, not wanting to take responsibility for our decisions. The decisions are ours, but the indications of the diagnosis are invaluable when we stand still and are unable to take a step or are afraid to get air in our lungs. Try it yourself and it gives you hope because you know that there is someone standing by and helping you. She helped me a lot, thanks to her professional but also purely ""human"" attitude I have the courage not only to take shy steps but even to run. If the fear of another breath paralyzes you terribly, she is the right person to go to. I think I value her ""life"" approach to the problem most, as if standing in a valley (sometimes with only shreds of information), she has the ability to evaluate, which others do not have when they are on a mountain (with hundreds of pages of documentation). I admire her, but at the same time I appreciate her very much as a doctor."
2838,"I was at the Doctor's for a check-up visit and for the selection of glasses. I do not have any defects or ailments so it is difficult for me to assess the competence and knowledge of the Doctor. Nevertheless, she is a nice, kind and patient-friendly person. She has devoted enough time to me. I am satisfied and I recommend the Doctor. Joanna"
2839,"The hotel absolutely does not hold the Accor 4 star level. At the weekend in the middle of the winter season the café and bar SA NIECZYNNE , and in the restaurant offer wine but only with consumption even for hotel guests who have just finished their dinners in this restaurant, incidentally speaking, only active until 22 . 00 . The cleaning lady enters the room in spite of the sign NOT TO BE SURE. In the bathroom, a surprise, the water connected in reverse flows warmly after switching on the cold and vice versa. Inside, they make a sensation of being untidy and the rooms actually cleaned in 5 minutes can't be clean. In the restaurant the card is very poor in comparison with other Mercure. The only small advantage is the well equipped Spa, which unfortunately does not follow the rules of its own. In the pool and jacuzzi parents drift with their children in diapers although there is a special pool for children."
2840,"I definitely don't recommend it. Apart from the fact that the doctor is indeed cordial, nice and smiling (even exaggeratedly) it did not help anything. He has not even analyzed the case. He stated that ""young is healthy"" already after entering the office and starting the visit (which lasted circa 5 min). He stated this before any conversation about the ailments and repeated throughout the meeting. He did not analyze and did not even try to analyze the case in order to help, and after I took the discharge card out of the hospital he found that it was not a gastrological operation (it was a urological operation and a referral to a gastrologist got 'em from a urologist who did not like the morphology and enlarged spleen) and was not related to the ailments. He only asked about ""my diseases and the diseases in the family"", a question that the family doctor might as well ask. He also did not look into the history of treatment, including the antibiotics administered. He showed me two results of blood tests (performed almost 3 months after the operation (about 4-5 days of hospital stay)). The doctor found that one of the tests was abnormal, that is, one with increased liver and pancreas parameters (3-5x) and the other, later, around the standards (the period between tests was a few days). He did not commission any additional tests to make sure which one (because even if one of the tests is actually done incorrectly it is a 50% chance that it is bad and a 50% chance that it is good, but the doctor on the eye stated that everything is ok because ""The pancreas does not hurt and the young is healthy""). The only thing he recommended was to appear in 4 - 5 months and take Essentiale forte . It is also a kind of ignorance to propose one type of diet ""proper"" (50 - 60% carbohydrates) ignoring even if physical activity. I definitely do not recommend ."
2841,"I am a little surprised by the negative opinions, because after the first visit I am very satisfied, according to Mrs. Munir is ok much better than the orthodontists in the hospital at Karmelicka Street, who said that the treatment of my defect makes no sense! I didn't have to ask anything, Dr. Munir herself told me everything in detail what and how, etc., including the fact that the braces can be reimbursed until the age of 18, which in Karmelicka Street I was not even advised to say. . . I recommend Dr. Munir and advise against hospital in Karmelicka Street!"
2842,"A book with nice pictures of gluten-free baked goods, but anyone who has baked gluten-free baked goods knows that they don't look like these pictures, so whatever is in these pictures is - it's more likely plastic. . . The main disadvantage of the book is that when gluten-free people cannot consume cereal derivatives, the author insists on basing almost the whole book on flour products instead of presenting gluten-free products from nature (dishes based on rice, groats, vegetables, meat, legumes, potatoes. . . ) To make matters worse, flour products are based on extracts and not on naturally gluten-free flours - corn, buckwheat, rice or potato. As for me, the whole book is sponsored by a company, and the author cared more about the advertising box office than about showing gluten-free people how to eat well and with sense."
2843,"A few days ago we spent a weekend in this hotel, a nice location, a comfortable bed and a spacious room. The pool area is small and unfortunately very crowded. The sauna sessions are great. Unfortunately the dinners were not tasty. . . . . .the pork chop had 3mm of meat and the rest was a coating. Soup creamed with tasteless vegetables. She asked me about 3 desserts and none of them were available because it was over. The waitresses were mainly busy talking even though they asked us for juice for the baby and we only got it after 25 minutes. Breakfast was varied, fresh and tasty. Unfortunately, on Saturday, there was a wedding at the hotel, very loud and you couldn't sleep, the next day almost to 1:00 p.m. dirt everywhere in the corridor ""vomiting"" the guest, dirty. . ."
2844,"I don't think it makes any sense to write an opinion about something that is great, so she wanted me to write about a dishwasher defect. I have BOSCH for the first time and I will admit that he is far from the Whirpool I had before. First of all, there's a lack of control that the washing has ended. If I'm out and she hasn't heard the final signal, it's not clear that the washing is over. The same is not known what the stage is. Sometimes she doesn't spit out the pills and the pots are dirty. And unfortunately, compared to Whirlpool, she loses in the category of tightly placed pots, whirlpool did great, apparently had better water pressure. It's a lot of limp with Bosch. I have to manually wash it down to the maximum. The guides at the bottom are not precise and the bottom basket always falls off when fully extended. This did not happen in Whirpool because the guides had contours on the door."
2845,"During the ski trip to Les 2 Alpes we stayed in Maeva apartments. Worse place has not yet seen the m . The first, a huge minus, is the heating, or rather its lack. When after almost 30 hours of travel we entered the icy room and found out that the heating is not working, she thought I'd cry. In the middle of winter, high in the Alps, the non-working heating should exclude such a room from the offer, or am I wrong? They reported us lack of heating (in our travel agency, because the hotel staff did not see us even once), but NO one showed up, for a week. They heated our ""apartment"" by unscrewing the electric cooker to the maximum. . . It wasn't safe enough, but at least we didn't freeze. The second big minus, it's cleanliness. Our apartment was just a mess - the whole kitchen and all the dishes were dirty, not to mention the bathroom. In order to be able to use the room, we had to clean it first. Interestingly, we were required to be impeccably clean on departure under the threat of deducting cleaning costs from the deposit. So we cleaned the room a second time. It is a pity that those who lived there before us did not deduct anything from the bail. The common areas in the building have also long since seen no vacuum cleaner or mop. And a third huge minus - noise. The building was very noisy, every night wild screams of drunken people at 3 am. I understand that not everyone goes skiing, just to a party, but you can do it a little quieter. Even the earplugs did not guarantee a good night's sleep. In conclusion, it couldn't be any worse. We will never go there again."
2846,"It's hard to tell me what kind of pediatrician he is, but as an internist he didn't show off in my case. I came with an untreated cold, even though I had taken antibiotics before, but unfortunately I didn't get rid of my cold. The doctor said that with a cold, it can be that it lasts for weeks. . . ... I asked for 2 - 3 days off to get rid of it (2 weeks of the disease made me very weak and I barely stood on my feet), unfortunately I found out that there was no need: / in return I got a whole list of healers i.e. nurofen, sudafed etc. If after 2 weeks of a severe cold, a persistent rhinitis despite taking antibiotics, the doctor prescribes sudafed, then there is probably something wrong. . ."
2847,"It's a really great place for people who want to rest and seek silence. Fairytale location and beautiful nature is the certainty of a good rest. The scent of pine forest surrounds this place and you feel that you are eating. An additional advantage is the lake - a paradise for anglers, but not only. It is also important that the staff is helpful and nice. It is really worth coming here and the time you will spend here will not be wasted."
2848,"You're amazing! Just perfect. He doesn't even see the girls in the first lane laughing at him with tears on their cheeks because he only looks at the gentleman and addresses his statements to them (I don't want to see why). He appreciates it very much because half a point costs only 100 PLN, the consultation is a very personal matter for him and he is not going to talk about it and he is not going to say it either because it is not important for him: the most important thing is to limit the draught and it is surprising that all the lecturers are doing two examples each of this topic and he is doing two examples in two hours! ! ! You can't interrupt because you are in danger of -1 disturbing the classes even though you answer the questions he asks. You can do trivial tasks for 2 hours, so it's better not to imagine how much more difficult the tasks are done, even though they are a bit more difficult."
2849,"I have had two episodes of depression so far, which I have treated in consultation with a psychiatrist. The first one was treated by Dr Kaczmarkiewicz, the second by another psychiatrist in Cracow. Dr. Kaczmarkiewicz prescribed me medication which helped me to get out of my depression temporarily, but I had a relapse. When I managed to get out of my first episode, I was very grateful to him and even recommended him to my friends. Now, after the second episode, I see his role completely different and under no circumstances will I recommend him to anyone else. I judge my psychiatrist in Krakow by an order of magnitude better. First of all, Dr. Kaczmarkiewicz did not go through enough trouble to at least superficially realize the causes of my condition. He did only a very basic medical interview (he asked about the tendency to depression in the family, stimulants, etc.), diagnosed ""mood reduction"" and immediately prescribed antidepressants. Then basically all he was interested in was whether there were any side effects and how I feel. He didn't refer me to psychotherapy right away, and it is she (I know it only now) that is the key to actually dealing with problems once and for all. To excuse him, I have to say that after 1, 5 from the start of the treatment, the holidays started and I was not in Warsaw long. However, he informed the doctor about it in advance and today he expects me from him all the more that he will devote my time and explain how he should continue to treat me and that the key is that I stay in contact with the doctor (not even necessarily with him) . At the beginning of the second episode I was em abroad and decided to contact the doctor by phone. It was difficult, the doctor at first did not have time for me and the second time he spent all 3 minutes of his precious time with me. Although if there was a reasonable suspicion that I was depressed, he knew how I was suffering and how much it cost me to make even a simple phone call to him. In general I have a deep feeling that the doctor didn't do his best in my case. I can't tell if I was unlucky or if Dr. Kaczmarkiewicz treats all patients with such attention. However, I am convinced that there are better doctors than him."

2851,"The hotel's glory days are behind us. The rooms are clean, refreshed but a little small. The service is old-fashioned - a lot of young people who are learning hospitality. I prefer people who may not be able to do everything, but you can see that they care more than bloated people who have to apologize for interrupting their work. Good cuisine, it's not a restaurant but a good canteen. Tasty. Pretty big choice, big plus. The advantage is the aquapark, is what to do and where to rest after an active day while waiting for a meal. Location on the sidelines."
2852,"She was in Charlotte Valley for one night. Location super , attractions super . The room is clean nice neat - it has its charm and climate . It's cool that the hotel has a swimming pool, bowling alleys, etc. because it's an average base - quite far away everywhere. But if someone wants to relax, this place is perfect. The zoo + sealarium and stud farm - a revelation. The only downside was that this new bowling alley and the second restauration were both booked and so ordinary tourists after 10pm had nothing to do, have a drink or even sit down. The food was tasty but for this price there could be more choice for dinner."
2853,"Delicious and varied breakfasts . We walked around the hotel on foot. The hotel staff provided us with a parking lot around the corner in a safe place (advance booking), price 22 euros per day. The hotel is located in a relatively quiet area, nice access - we were not standing anywhere in traffic jams even though we arrived on Saturday. Beautiful Prague!"
2854,"Unfortunately, suggesting positive opinions, we directed ourselves to Mrs. Ania; indeed, the first visit was nice and friendly, theoretically full of commitment, etc. Unfortunately, as it turns out, a bit for show. The diet turned out not to take into account what we talked about for more than an hour, so in general, some items of the diet referred to other people (completely different names), hence the simple conclusion that these are not individual diets, but the standards sent to subsequent ""patients""; there is no clear diet plan based on the adopted assumptions (goals to be achieved by a particular person); besides, very unclear rules of settlement, for the first diet we managed to pay nearly 400 PLN (without a bill): ) or at least a receipt); after the next two or three weeks a new diet for another 200 PLN was proposed; in my opinion, the usual biting; the second meeting (theoretically already included in the price of the previous one) lasted 20 minutes and it seemed to notice that even our child Mrs. Annie was already disturbed (on the first visit / paid / was completely different); after the information about our resignation from cooperation, there was not even the slightest question about the reason; well, another naive man paid so the matter was settled; think before you decide. . . ."
2856,"The hotel deserves its 4 * if it is about equipment and comfort. The advantages go further but start with the fact that this is not a hotel for those who like the beaches and walks along the sea. The beach is narrow and rocky. The surroundings of the hotel are military warehouses surrounded by barbed wire and some fallen factory. I'm adding my photo. Besides, the hotel is good for those who like to relax by the pool and do not like to leave the hotel. The nearest town worthy of attention is Cefalo, but only 3 buses per day. Besides, good food and nice crew. Large rooms. Animation on a poor level limited to gymnastics by the pool."
2857,"He was working in the BCS recorder in pair with a second identical disk ( recorder with two disks ). One of them died today ( 25 / 11 / 2016 ) after 3 , 5 years of work ( warranty was for 3 years ). The second one is still the same one. Conclusion? Seagatings are faulty . But there are models that can work a little longer. And if someone has an unlucky fuchsiah, they can find a model that works a little longer than the warranty ( 3 years ) . Others fall under warranty after one or two years. And others work over 3 years ( like my other one ) . Nevertheless, these are generally emergency drives . If you want to be sure of a long, trouble-free operation, this model is not recommended."
2858,"The Łąkomin Palace and its surroundings (vast green area) has many advantages. You can rest there, take a walk, relax. The rooms are standard, although in the attic there are also very small rooms, with a mini bathroom, definitely too small and limiting the freedom. The owners of the facility are very nice and in touch, but unfortunately the person most often in contact with the guests is a mature gentleman who is naughty to guests, very imposing, his group service leaves a lot to be desired. The gentleman has been very hard on us during our stay, and has definitely had a bad influence on our reception of the whole meeting. To the advantages of this place I can add good cuisine: the food was tasty and fresh, homemade. There are breeding animals on the premises, which can be an asset for families with children. The object has great potential, the only question is how the owners will lead it. I suggest you start by replacing the service."
2859,"Michał z Rumi Doctor Adam has taken up the treatment of a tooth, the upper one after 4 resections with significant bone loss. Two surgeons / implantologists refused, and the situation seemed tragic. After a year I have a rebuilt bone and a beautiful zeba. The doctor is a professional, determined, confident of his skills and experience. Available even on weekends. After the visit to the clinic it turned out that almost all teeth need treatment. Treatments carried out with the use of a microscope, allowed to save many teeth. Dr. Adam works with a great team which makes the visits pleasant and not, as usual, full of fear. I highly recommend Dr. Wolniewicz's clinic, especially if you have problems that seem to be impossible to solve."
2860,"A terrible hotel. A general overhaul - everything old and worn out - would be useful. A comfortable bed, but it's basically the only plus. The room and the bathroom were simply dirty - the drinks of the previous guests, dirty toilet seat (!!!!), not very pleasant smell. . . Soaps in dispensers were also not refilled on a regular basis. Breakfast is very average, not very nice service. Hotel is a nightmare in comparison to the facility of this chain, even in Wroclaw. Wrong - never again ."
2861,"The hotel is really worth attention is very clean, everything looks nice. In the rooms you feel like you have a very clean house with nice modern equipment. The food is very good. I live a lot in hotels in ireland and this is one of my best. I really recommend."
2862,"""Trans isomers are present e.g. in hard margarines - in cubes, confectionery fats, chips, fast food products, powdered soups, snacks"" - said the director of IŻŻ, Professor Mirosław Jarosz. He added that trans isomers show only adverse effects on human health. They are a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, malignant tumors (especially prostate cancer) and type 2 diabetes. They are also likely to affect infertility, cause lactation disorders and promote bronchial asthma. The Food and Nutrition Institute recommends that in a diet ensuring appropriate nutritional value, the intake of trans isomers should be as low as possible - in the worst case, it should not exceed the maximum level of 1% recommended by the World Health Organization. In the worst case, it should not exceed the World Health Organisation recommended maximum level of 1% of energy from a full day's diet."
2863,"The following points protect the interests of the hotel in relation to guests who do not know how to behave in accordance with the norms of social coexistence and their behaviour or actions grossly violate the order adopted at the hotel, damaging not so much the hotel as the guests who follow the regulations. It should be remembered that the hotel is obliged to take care of the proper quality of the stay, and thus the interest of those guests who behave in accordance with the rules and regulations, and not the individual money changers, hooligans or troublemakers. A relatively young person who is a seasoned student should also be included in the hotel's regulations, in accordance with the spirit of the Act and after it has been recalled."
2864,"Each of us here is entitled to our own opinion. And yes, we do. . . According to me, nowhere has it been said that when five PATIENTS are satisfied with one particular doctor, the sixth, seventh or eighth will not express a negative opinion. . . Yes, I agree that there are no perfect people (doctors), but the truth is that if you help one of us, then her opinion will be positive and she will be a person recommending, but if she hasn't, then her opinion will be negative and she will definitely advise against the Doctor - it is a human reflex! ! ! In my opinion, it is not years of treatment that may indicate the doctors' expertise but the results, right? ! The body of each of us reacts differently to each treatment. . to every medical help. Hmm. . . I do not consider myself to be a brilliant person, but I am not aware of modern medicine either. . . . .well, apart from the doctor's criticism, you also criticize his patients - I do NOT THIS IS THE OPINION POLICY ON THE LEKER, right! ! !

2865,"Hello everyone - since I know Mr. Marek Braszkiewicz I recommend him to everyone who needs a specialist in endocrinology - family, friends, acquaintances. Dr. Braszkiewicz first listens, then orders examinations, finally scrupulously analyzes them, examines the patient to make a diagnosis, finally selects the right drugs and adjusts the dose to the patient's condition - and it is not easy in this area. It is always available at the expense of your time, your health time. . . Congratulations Doctor and gratitude forever! a very good one is not enough - it's a real doctor!"
2866,"I have had a camera for six months. I appreciate the free GPS with ovi maps, text editing and long battery life. Unfortunately, the casing is so poor that with quite a strong supervision on me, after a month I had to replace the casing because it bent (80pln). Apart from that, the basic functions are not working properly - a few times I was not able to make a connection at full range: a connection error in the network is busy. Recently, I have not received a call from the outside, but only an SMS informing that someone tried to connect with me. This someone hears a rumour that I am out of range. Sometimes it hangs up and you have to reboot it. Unlike its predecessor, a modem can only be used as a bluetooth connection, not a cable through which you can charge the battery."
2867,We stopped at the hotel on the way to W-you. Despite the location (exit to W - W) rooms are quiet and comfortable. Clean and fresh. Downstairs there was a restaurant where we ate late lunch and breakfast in the morning. Meals deserve to be distinguished because the cuisine is rich in regional Polish dishes and very tasty : )
2868,"It's an inexpensive hotel - it's at the same price level as Ibis, but in my opinion you get more in relation to the price. The room was quite spacious, had a decent desk with TV, wardrobe and kettle + tea/coffee. The bathroom was a bit worn out, however, especially the shower. They put foot pads on the floor, probably to prevent the guests from slipping - but the dirt is gathering on the edges and it was disgusting - I started to wonder if I would catch a fungus by using the shower. The whole room smelled a bit of old furniture, but that was not the biggest problem. It was a small single bed - not only short, but also very narrow. Another thing that could be a problem in the summer was the lack of air conditioning - but in November I only needed warm radiators. Another great advantage of IOR is the restaurant. The food is very good, the choice is good. They specialize in Italian cuisine - she ordered a caprese salad and pizza, both dishes were very good. Besides, the buffet breakfast was rather tasty - with a wide choice and nice details such as small desserts and warm coffee milk. Above all, however, the hotel staff is free, and it's great if you want to relax in your room after a hard day, but also want to have a snack. Since I was there to conduct training, I didn't mind being away from the city centre and I was glad to be very close to the airport. Generally speaking, despite the small problems, I would rather come back here if I had to go on a business trip to Poznan and face the costs again."
2869,"I do not recommend ! The family apartment has nothing to do with the pictures ! We paid 520 zloty for the night! Including cleaning. . . .where we already noticed the dirt at the entrance and the balcony with a beautiful view completely did not remind us of this offer. We expected a clean and spacious apartment and we got a dark burrow with dirt literally everywhere! The apartments are located in a building that has no elevator, which is another minus because there were two older people with us and the apartment was on the last floor. After calling the reception desk with your comments you sent us back to the website where we could complain in the form of emails, because we were late in the evening with small children and elderly people, we decided to sleep there. A tragedy to hell! In the pictures it looks great and the reality is different! I do not recommend!"
2870,"Engineering Effectiveness in Speaking and Writing Electric: Boring is such a course that there is nothing to explain: vink: write a cv and a cover letter zero average normal can be a boring lecture (on the other hand, it is difficult to talk interestingly about the subject matter discussed) .

2871,"She disappointed me. Booking made in advance, then waiting and visiting the hotel. Room ok, breakfast good. Departure from the parking lot damaged, every time there was a problem with leaving. Nights not sleeping because in the rooms next door were loud parties until 3 - 4 in the morning (rock band and others were troublesome, the night silence was not obligatory) Unfortunately, the reception could not solve the problem (no reaction) Relaxation Zamias was stress and nerves. . . . . . , , , After such a hotel chain expected better service and higher quality.

2872,"Cheap travel is becoming increasingly popular. Especially as there are more and more original ways to save on holidays. Names such as carpooling and couchsurfing sound a bit mysterious, but they mean simple ways for tourists to spend less without denying themselves the pleasure of a holiday. In planning a cheap holiday, the internet proves invaluable. The popularity of couchsurfing is growing, i.e. sharing accommodation with each other. On specially designed websites we can find accommodation in a given place. However, we do not pay the owners of the apartment in cash, but we provide them with accommodation at home. ""The condition is to find people who want to rent us a room and in the same holiday to visit our city and stay with us ."
2873,"In relation to the actual state, it is more than half the number. According to the Central Statistical Office on 31 July 2013, 105,8 thousand rooms were available in 2107 hotels in Poland. However, according to the estimates of the ""Hotel Management"" at the beginning of this year the number of hotel rooms in Poland exceeded 130 thousand. Such large differences result from different calculation methodologies and a different definition of a hotel. In Poland the basis for considering an accommodation facility as a hotel is its categorization into 1 - 5 stars in accordance with the law in force. On the other hand, STR considers as hotels first of all facilities operating within the structures of international hotel chains (even if they are not categorised as a hotel according to Polish regulations), and then the largest and modern facilities operating under their own brands."
2874,"A normal paediatrician neither impresses nor deters. The results will be seen, the drugs will be prescribed. A second time I wouldn't pay. You're okay. In private, you expect the doctor to give you clear and complete answers to your questions. That's what I missed. The doctor was also on the phone looking for the right medication and a dosage for the disease in her area of specialization with prohibited diseases. My observation and what I heard from the doctor's mouth during the visit made me feel that she had no experience in this area, but in the end she could only make sure."
2875,"I am pleased to recommend and wish everyone a chance to find such great and professional specialists as Mr. Luke! : ) I just happened to run into your doctor to remove two eights. Treatments were not a simple, quite unpleasant experience. Despite this, I am surprised by the mega professionalism and calm approach. Mr. Doctor very delicately and with great precision he performs his work, which affects the great comfort and sense of security in his hands. Nothing hurts, and this is the most important thing. In addition, I will mention the pleasant atmosphere in the office. As a patient I can add that she can definitely relieve the accompanying stress and horror before the procedure: ) The commitment to her work can be seen from a distance : ) You can fully trust. Great ! To sum up, Mr. Lukasz is an excellent dentist and a nice person. I hope there are more of them. I highly recommend and greetings : )"
2876,"I say in advance that I know about the equipment, I buy only company stuff, bosch, festool, fein and I see any defects. A vacuum cleaner bought in 2008, used in my one-man company at the track and in general, such as vacuuming dust from the floor before priming and tiling. The engine has just burned down after half an hour's work with an eccentric sander after 3 years of light work . The plastic handle broke off immediately. Tipping vacuum cleaner, inside the tank are highlighted on the wheels from underneath, which tear the bags (the manufacturer specially did so to buy hopeless bags), bags of 16 zł each are enough for an hour of work and it is better not to leave the vacuum cleaner in the car or moisture will immediately destroy the bag. Dust cleaner with dirty air, every now and then you need to clean the filter, change the bags, just a tragedy"
2877,"He was at your doctor's 3 months ago. A small filling - the whole procedure, which cost 400 PLN, took only 15 minutes. The tooth hurt me for 4 weeks and finally stopped when I was going to go for a follow-up visit. Unfortunately, after another few weeks the tooth started to hurt me again. . . . .so I have to check what happens to my tooth. . . It's the first time I've ever seen such a situation. Mrs. Dr. Dr. Dr. advised me to remove the eights, which - as I have recently advised other dentists - is completely unnecessary for me - they do not hurt or disgust me. Regardless of the toothache, I had such a feeling that Mrs. Dr. wants to treat as much as possible, regardless of whether there is a need or not. . ."
2878,Locationally good hotel for people who just want to take a break from their journey. For those who want to explore nearby Bergamo or further afield Milan is not suitable due to the distance and poor connection. Even an evening walk leads only to . . . . . .nowhere. The hotel itself is pleasant and well-kept and qualitatively adequate to the number of stars and price . Nice and helpful service . Clean and spacious rooms . Generally recommendable . . . . .on the go !
2879,"Even though the chairs are pretty, the product represents a tragedy - that's not much said anyway. The performance is fatal and the durability does not exist. After just a few days, the chairs (two of them) started to squeak and swing to the sides, which seriously bothers the sleeping housewives. By loosening the elements you have to have the courage to sit on the highest level. Fortunately, sitting at the highest level does not last long, because the lifting mechanism has stopped holding and the chair is lowered by itself under the weight of the person sitting! ! ! Recently (I have had it for 1 or 5 years) a seal to protect the floor from damage has been broken from under the base of one hocker. Avoid the long arch ! ! ! !"
2880,"Housing conditions are good, breakfasts and dinners are not very different, by choosing a package you risk being treated less well - because cheaper - the staff at the reception desk is naughty including the manager. I'm surprised at the price of lunch, which in my opinion is estimated at 5-6 zloty costs is sold for 32 zloty. quality and weight below criticism. Small TVs and a small number of programs ."
2881,"I assess the contact, or rather the lack of it, because the reservation was not made. She tried to call me all day, for many hours to make a reservation and ask a few questions beforehand. On the website is given (in additional options) the price for breakfast for all adults. How much will I pay for my child? It is not known. She also wanted to know if there is still construction going on because she read my opinion that it is very loud and unpleasant. There is no chance that someone will answer the phone, actually I wonder if this center is still in operation. The only information on the phone was that the line was busy and an employee would call back. It's impossible to record because the box is full. All day anyway. Busy and nobody calls back. I'm not going to call anymore, for me it's a total failure and the competition is so big that it's a pity the nerves at Blue Mountain Resort."
2882,"Hello... I have a question: if I go to see a doctor in the 11th week of my pregnancy, will it not be too early? ? And if one of the Patients had such a service in the 11th week, I ask for information because maybe my question will be childish, but is it vaginal or normal in such earlier pregnancy? And is the husband with me or not? What does it look like from the autopsy? Thank you for solving my doubts. . ."
2883,"He's been treated with Dr. Ufnalewski for several months. I think he is a very good doctor. She noticed that she is not limited only to her specialty. She also knows other things very well. I am pregnant and I have a cardiological problem. Because this is my second pregnancy and the problem was also in the previous pregnancy, so I have the opportunity to assess, because previously I went somewhere else. Dr. Ufnalewski is perfectly aware of the problem, sometimes I have the impression that he knows more than my cardiologist, to whom I also go. I am very happy that she has found me a doctor. I am not hiding that it is thanks to this website."
2884,"The biophysicist says that DNA repair mechanisms sometimes break down. If scientists get a better understanding of the structure of the complex, they will be able to better design pharmaceuticals in the future that will support seamstresses in certain dysfunctions. But there is another important aspect of this research. Perhaps they will help scientists to develop compounds that will repair the DNA in selected cells and block it out completely. For why should the body waste energy on mending DNA in cells that are anyway spoiled - for example in cancer cells. . . ""It is better that the spoiled DNA of these dangerous cells is not repaired and the cell is destroyed faster"" - notes prof . The spinal cord . And it does not exclude that in the future the research on DNA seamstresses will be used in the work on new cancer therapies."
2885,"Let's check if services such as sauna, meals, parking are not additionally paid for. The classification of the object to the appropriate type and category is made by the Marshal of the voivodeship, who also checks whether the entrepreneurs comply with certain requirements. The list of hotel facilities can be checked in a special register. Requirements In hotels and motels five-, four- and three-star motels there must be a bathroom in each room, and in the case of guesthouses only in those that have five or four stars. Only four - and five-star hotels and motels must provide a guarded car park, a guarded garage or a guarded parking space."
2886,"She was at the Olender Hotel more than once. A plus of course is the swimming pool, saunas, spa and very nice service at the reception. The playground. Unfortunately, the breakfasts are getting poorer and poorer, and you have to ask for a finished butter or cake. Once upon a time there were cakes, casseroles and now every day only scrambled eggs, sausages, black pudding and sausages. The quality of dishes from the restaurant menu depends on the chef who is on shift. In the past, pancakes with chocolate-nut cream were 2 or 3 times bigger. However, if I get an incomplete dish because the chef made a mistake, it is either given a discount or some gratis for the customer. The rooms are generally clean, but I think that daily garbage removal should be standard and not only when you hang a card ""Please clean up"" . Water is not refilled either."
2887,"The Szafir Hotel in Jastrzebia Gora, which is based on the Willa Magnat guesthouse, will soon welcome guests. After more than a year of construction work with 15 rooms, built in a manor house style, the Magnat guesthouse has been transformed into a modern 50 room Szafir hotel. The hotel has gained not only a new body, additional rooms and an extensive gastronomic area, but also conference facilities, spa complex, swimming pool and bowling alley. Due to its location, close to the centre of Jastrzębia Góra, the facility will also house a bank and service points. A characteristic element of the hotel is the garden arranged on the roof."
2888,"I agree with my predecessors! ! A cheater! ! I let myself be dragged into his place for some treatments, for which she paid a few hundred zloty! ! Now I see that it's completely unnecessary. Not only that, but when I got pregnant, he gave me some medicine for menopause. It is good that she read the leaflet or she would have lost my baby. When she went to ask me what is the matter with these drugs, he ran to the office hiding from me! ! STYD! ! This is the guy and the doctor! ! I advise against it! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The medicines are of course saved from colourful folders provided by the representatives ! ! Even for taking an ultrasound he had to pay 10 PLN. I leave it all without any comment and sincerely advise you to stay away from this guest. There were 4 of us who used his ""services"". Today, thank God none of us go there! ! POLIMED with SZYMALA in the lead is a mistake ! !"
2889,"She had the misfortune of giving birth to my first child, and she was on duty by this ""doctor"" in Ujastek. He was playing cat and mouse with me all day long, first promising to cause cramps and a moment later withdrawing from it (my water went out and there were no cramps). Finally, after several hours, she put me on her own and got a drip. The reason that this gentleman gave as a refusal to give oxytocin was that in 12 hours my doctor will come on duty and she will take care of me. I'll add that it was Saturday night on Sunday, 6 years ago so the traffic at Ujastek wasn't that big then. The birth was terrible, nobody took care of me, my midwife friend ""Doctor"" also denied me. Kowalczyk during childbirth all the time he was joking in a disgusting way, he regretted that he was not paid enough and yet other people's childbirths must be picked up. At the end, as a retaliation he probably sewed me up alive, without anesthesia, mocking me and teasing my moans! He is a really ""wonderful"" doctor ! I hope there are more of them ! And I will never forget how you treated me, and I will continue to spread the word wherever I can! !"
2890,"Excellent classes. Very nice contact with the student . In the course you will learn all the basics of climbing : ) And if you already know how to climb - you go to the wall (and there is a lot of space where you can try it). You have to do your homework (as far as I can remember, up to three homeworks did not change the grade). If you have more homework (and there is an important reason) you could get along with the teacher."
2891,"It's really cool on Algebra, but for example, on Analysis 1 out of 70 people only 25 went further ; - ( We'll miss you. . . . ."
2892,"This is 85 times the standard price of 42 euros. In fact, it is much more than the increase in the price of an apartment in Warsaw near the National Stadium, which during the games increased ""only"" 57 times compared to the standard price. This does not change the fact that prices in hotels in Ukraine have increased significantly. While a day at a hotel in Lviv or Kiev normally costs 25-35 euros, during Euro 2012 the same rooms are sold for 500 euros. AFP, citing an anonymous source similar to the tournament organizers, informs that UEFA is dissatisfied with the situation in Lviv, where even the UEFA office located in the new stadium is leaking the ceiling of the communication room. According to the Statistical Office of Ukraine in the country operates ok . 1, 3 thousand hotels, most of them with a standard of 2 - 3 stars, there are only a dozen or so hotels of the highest standard. These are mostly new facilities, created especially before Euro 2012, and mostly belonging to international hotel chains."
2893,"Meanwhile, as he said during one of the debates at the European Economic Congress, there is also a lack of knowledge about this dangerous disease and proper education about the fact that obesity is a threat and physical activity is necessary. ""We should not eat sweets at all. This is energy that must be burned immediately. So if we eat five bars, we should go to the siding and unload the coal wagon. If we eat them in front of the computer and don't burn them, the body converts this energy into fat for the times when there is no hunted mammoth in the fridge, but mammoth is now a lot, every day they are in the fridge. If overweight develops in a person who is not able to produce enough insulin, it is diabetes,"" he jokingly explained the link between obesity and disease in a conversation with PAP."

The purchase in an online store so I did not have the opportunity to test it live before. It turns out that the recommended 2way family kit just doesn't fit together (it's a bad fit). Of course, I visited a service located in Chorzow where I was explained and shown on the other copies that this is fine. And if you want to see for yourself what it means well then I invite you to watch the video."
2896,"A very nice hotel was made in the building of the cult hotel of the 80s. Everything seems to be renovated, and I guess it is. The rooms are unqualified. The location of the hotel is excellent - the very centre of Gdynia . Large parking lot next to the hotel - paid. The service is very nice and helpful . I recommend ."
2897,"Hotel in a very good location, only 5 minutes to the subway, 300 m to the tram. Quiet area with lots of shops and cheap bars. The room is very clean and large. We have spent over a week there and we are very satisfied. Breakfast is typically Italian, but you can enjoy yourself in peace. Access to tea and coffee around the clock. Very nice service, speaking English."
2898,"There was a time slip and the price was slightly higher than expected by the price list, but maybe the doctor qualified our visit differently. This is only the first visit, so it is difficult to assess the course of treatment. However, the doctor got to know the case of the son, examined him thoroughly, looked at the documentation we brought, listened and explained very carefully how to proceed, how to administer drugs, what drugs and why he is saving. Besides, it was a nice lady with a lot of experience and good attitude towards children. I am satisfied."
2899,"algebra - lectures very cool woman, she does a lot of exemplary tasks, so it is worth to appear at the lectures, especially if it is the first contact with algebra. Everything is clearly explained, if not, then you can quietly ask questions. I recommend! !"
2900,"TV in the room did not work, no light bulbs in the bedside lamps, I waited more than half an hour to check out despite making an online quick check-in and check-out, the only plus is a nice lady in the room : - )"
2901,"Rooms, bathroom ok - although it blew heavily through a leaky window (cold). Tragic breakfasts, you have to ask for everything - no one will ask whether to serve scrambled eggs. There was a lack of butter and sugar. Small choice compared to 2 - 3 star hotels. Coffee maker probably never cleaned. They ordered them dinner (Pork sirloin with ravioli and spinach, water potatoes, fried potatoes). He got 'em Filet of duck baked with mushroom dumplings and the waitress told me ! ! ! that it was a sirloin. . . . .friends next door ordered the same thing and got it normally. . Additionally, instead of water potatoes they got 'em baked and instead of fried vegetables - cooked. The potatoes were to be replaced, but they didn't arrive even though I waited 30 minutes. In a word, they spend what they have, no matter what the customer orders. A tragicomedy, an amateur. I definitely do not recommend a restaurant in this hotel."
2902,"I know that it's easiest to spit on someone ""anonymously"" and such an opinion can sometimes hurt a good doctor. She was a patient of Dr. Milewicz. A visit at a decent price, he sent me to the hospital for all the tests - so far the only doctor who ordered a complex of tests. [ NFZ ] The hospital is a bit of a hustle and bustle - a lot of patients - if I hadn't noticed, I wouldn't have done 2 important tests - a bit of a tape, but ok . Dr . Milewicz cannot be ""caught"" - he sneaks around the ward - which is understandable - a lot of work . After the study was completed, he wrote down his medication - the most important one was to take half a pill, in 6 months - 1 \ 4 . And everything would be fine if it was not for the next visit - well - he proposed that m still take half a pill - because he quotes - ""Does he want to divide me into 4'' - she dazzled m . In addition, the results of vaginal cultures were poor, he ordered treatment - the drugs he prescribed were ""without composition and order"" - I quote the words of the Pharmacy Master. . . . . Sure he is - he was a good professional but in my opinion he has too many patients and gets lost in it."
2903,"Very good location of the hotel, allows quick and easy access to the city center, a metro station nearby. Simple breakfast included in the price. We had a clean, comfortable room with a bathroom in the corridor but this is no problem because there are several bathrooms, they are kept in very good condition. The staff is very helpful. I recommend"
2904,"Location - very pleasant food - terrible, no taste, burnt fish, heated potatoes, not fresh bread. access road - a bit like off-road driving, I feel sorry for my car general mess around, you can see the shortcomings, the pool dirtytoallet uncleaned service - young children for the season, did not notice any manager who would manage everything Price completely inadequate to what you get behind it. spa ? - someone probably very abused in himself in the nameHotel should have 3 stars and only deserves a bed for two people made of two single ones, who are also hugging each other, and in love with each other on departure will not sleep the aura in the room itself quite dry, I wouldn't recommend a romantic double-door trip as if from cardboard you could hear every room next door and very soothing snoring or constant pushing of beds by everyone, the only plus that was worth paying some money for was the view from the balcony to the mountains. Whereas 720 zloty for 2 nights in this hotel is an ordinary rip-off, unless someone has low expectations and likes to spend money, while for the same price you can sleep well in Gubalowka itself!"
2905,"Although the guesthouse looks lovely, I advise against: the staff at the reception desk is not nice. In the restaurant, the oldest of the waiters, they allow themselves to be loudly addressed to customers, breakfasts monotonous as in the hospital. The hotel's restaurant's maintenance officer acts like the owner, screams at the hotel guests' children, chases them out of the hallway, adults also rudely pay attention. All prospective guests are advised to look carefully at the room before entering, as all faults and damage are attributed to the guests. I do not recommend! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
2906,"The researcher points out that these are problems that everyone who has ever been in hospital is aware of. However, after visits to specific centres and conversations these assumptions are now properly documented. The first stage of the project will be completed with a diagnosis of the conditions prevailing in the patient rooms. The diagnosis is to be made in the hospitals . In the second stage we plan to conduct a case study,"" says Prof . Bogdan . - In one of the hospitals we want to propose changes, which are mainly low-cost. Sometimes these are really small things that can greatly improve the conditions in which the patients are staying, e.g. proper placement of the iris. Then we will check how these changes affect the patients."
2907,"I was in Novum at Dr. Wolski's with his husband because the result was ambiguous for us. The doctor congratulated the husband on our luck, and explained exactly what and how. He was very specific, not cotton-woven, and at the same time very cultured. The plague with optimism. I recommend it!"
2908,"Welcome to the prelude I wanted to say that Dr. Mazur has his customers in trouble. If someone likes him, he's treated nice, too nice. My wife used to go to Mr. Mazur, one time my wife was at the examination, the doctor wouldn't put his gloves on because why? The doctor has a better experience then! And not to mention that you can carry different bacteria and diseases! ! ! My wife's visit has already ended with Dr. Mazur! I'M GIVING YOU THIS DOCTOR!"
2909,"The hotel has its own charm and style and a great location, and the view from the roof, where you can drink wine for example, is breathtaking. The only way to get there was quite frightening, because when driving our big car we had to fold the mirrors to fit between the walls of the buildings - but it was worth it."
2910,"The hotel is not completed in 2016 (according to Ithaca's office) but has been partially renovated. The bathrooms are old and dirty. The swimming pool is painted with some kind of paint, which will leave dirty marks on the bathing suits! Unfortunately, they cannot be washed away. The large swimming pool and paddling pool for children is dirty. The beach is far away (farther than the office gives you). It is led to it by a winding, sideways, dangerous road. All Inclusive version - strange, in containers there is white wine, rosé wine, red wine, juices (poor quality) and there is no bubble with water to drink (in rooms also). Unfortunately, everyone had to go to the shop - about 1km to buy it! Unfortunately, the lady who cleaned the rooms on the 2nd floor (room 312), decided to charge herself a fee for cleaning the room (poor cleaning) and took out of her wallet, which was hidden - euro . An unpleasant experience - the first time it happened to me. Please be careful. The hotel staff is very nice. Everyone is walking smiling and willing to help. The advantage of the hotel is that it is intimate, there is no problem with deckchairs, no queue during meals. To the beach and to the larger towns there is a hotel bush (unfortunately rarely). Nice island, unfortunately dirty. It was the first time I met with the fact that in every tourist town there is information for tourists in Polish. Greeks are nice, helpful and try to speak to us in our native language. She was traveling with the Polish office of Zante Magic Tours. The tours were well prepared, super guides. I recommend it!"
2911,"The bag got 'em for free when buying a laptop ( version 17 ) , as for free I'm satisfied with it . Or maybe it was 'em rather, until one of the plastic shoulder strap fastenings broke, which resulted in the bag and its contents falling on the pavement. Fortunately, the walls are reinforced enough that the laptop did not suffer. It is worth noting, however, that my laptop is quite heavy, so in case of a smaller version this problem may not be as significant. I don't know how much the company has saved on the use of plastic mountings instead of metal, but they would do better to increase the price by a few zlotys so that in return you don't have to worry about whether the mount will last. It also lacks a more sensible front pocket to fit the power supply and mouse. Yes, you can squeeze it in there, but then the pocket is unnaturally stuffed and theoretically this could lead to a dent in the laptop lid. In general, I think the price/quality ratio is satisfactory."
2912,"The only plus is that the doctor took the patient in, even though he was late. However, the examination was performed for 10 minutes, very routinely. Despite the specific description in the referral, he did not pay attention to what should be precisely examined in the service. He limited his messages to ""good morning, whether there were any surgeries, whether there was already such an ultrasound examination, please lie down, turn to the left side. . . "" and then - "" the result ok, goodbye "" . The contact with the patient is de facto none."
2913,"The room is clear at first sight, but after removing the small table of cats from the dust. Mattresses are dead and stained . But what makes me VERY advise against staying is the extreme noise and curses coming from the street to the early morning hours . In July, the heat and lack of ventilation, which requires at least a tilting of the window and what further leads to experiences that have nothing to do with rest. I leave the hotel before time - losing money because of health damage."
2914,"Large rooms, bathrooms without any problems, generally clean. The organization of the stay is basically at a similar level as in equivalent places. Indoor swimming pool ok , small gym ok . Big minus - closed elevator . There was only one room open, which, with a very high occupancy rate, meant that you had to stand in line for the lift."
2915,"The air conditioning in the rooms is working, although there is probably no heating option because the heater is separate electric on wheels. In tv C + , so you can watch the matches, unfortunately tv small . This is one of the few hotels in Poznan, which has smoking rooms and air conditioning, as we add to this underground parking (such a semi-open in principle) is already narrowing the list to a few. The ibis standard, there is no frenzy, but it is clean. The beds are very comfortable. Breakfast is unfortunately a failure, I always eat 3 sausages and also croissant with chocolate. As for me, the location is very good."
2916,"I haven't had much crap. Peaks during the pause, it is not possible to scroll through the song, in the case of more music you have to enable random selection to hit the album / song you want to listen to. In addition, it is very often hung up and you have to carry a toothpick to reset because it is located in such a small hole. Generally I do not recommend! It is better to add a few golds and buy some other player, preferably with a basic display and normal buttons."
2917,"I have the impression that the climate during the visit to Dr. Szymula's depends on two factors - whether the enthusiasm for the patient and whether she is in the mood. Twice she heard his comments about my weight (and at that time I was weighing 56 kg at 162 cm, so none of them is overweight, which does not change the fact that I still remember my attention (after 4 years ...)). As far as competence is concerned - 3 years he treated me from an infection from which he did not cure me, but he made me immune to most of the available drugs. It was helped by a great dopier and absolutely the best doctor I have ever had to deal with in my life - Dr Olszak-Sokołowska from Medicover in Gdynia. Today I have a subscription in Lux Meda again and I know that the best doctors are not there and I will not go to Szymula for sure. Malicious, arrogant type, I recall visits very unpleasantly"
2918,"The laptop is very mobile - it has a lightweight, slim design and passive cooling, making it almost silent. Surprisingly, it also keeps the working temperature very low - the laptop is always cool or gently warm under the left wrist. Unfortunately, the quality of workmanship gives a lot to wish for. Although the case is well made (at least this creates the impression), unfortunately, from the very beginning there are some problems with the components. From time to time, but not too often you can hear strange squeaking from the inside of the cabinet, and the speaker of the dial at 40 % volume level. There are also occasional problems with the graphical driver. The battery lasts for up to 3 hours. The performance is sufficient to work, learn and play with older games."
2919,"Unfortunately, it will leave much to be desired. . . The paint comes off the walls, cold, blows through the windows. The walls like a cardboard box can hear everything the neighbor is doing. In the bathroom the humidity on the ceiling. A room with billiards paid additionally and finishing in a nomadic drama."
2920,"I agree with Jurek of Lubin in 100%, although he used to make a mistake in my case regarding the proper assessment of the knee joint, which cost me unnecessary surgery (it is, however, a difficult joint to diagnose) I will just add that the difficulty in establishing contact with the doctor is due to the fact that after and before the examination he is busy answering phones and registering patients. . . This class specialist could afford a secretary! ! !"
2921,"She was at Dr.'s once for a consultation and research. After this one visit, I found that Dr. is a very distant and cold person. She was in a hurry and she wanted to ""take care of me"" as soon as possible. I was diagnosed with a hearing loss, I have an appointment with a dentist - and what next, I don't know. The staff was very nice and very familiar with the facility, I was well informed."
2922,"I'm not too demanding, but this hotel is not recommended to everyone because of the nightmare rooms - claustrophobic, with prison barrels. If it would be possible to manage the holes in the mice, there would probably also be rooms in them. Rooms with windows in the courtyard are a joke - without daylight, with 24-hour noise from the courtyard, which in the evening becomes part of the restaurant. The lack of air-conditioning, which in the summer in such an airless building is unbearable (we sleep with the door to the corridor open, you cause any air movement). It was supposed to be a romantic trip to Masuria, and came out of this survival. Good food in the restaurant and nice staff were not able to compensate for the spoiled holiday. I strongly advise against it. Especially for this price."

2924,"I've been waiting for a very long visit and what? I went with a child who looked like he was burned with acid - such a severe allergy. At first he asked what he expected from him, he just looked at the face, didn't look at the child and said it wasn't treatable for him. Wash in plain soap and lubricate with linseed oil. I was lubricating, the wounds on the body from scratching and the child continued to suffer and swell. I was strongly allergic to the neurological medicine, which then led to edema of the gastrointestinal tract, and thus probably everyone knows! A total lack of respect for parents and a fatal and actually no approach to children. I waited a long time for a visit because it was supposed to be good - I absolutely advise against it."
2925,"She was going to spend 2 nights at the Hotel Alka during my visit to Palanga. We got a room in the communist part of the building (yes, after leaving the reception ends the wonderful hotel shown in the pictures and starts the hotel ""komuno come back"" - old windows, horrible bathroom, destroyed doors, in a word - horror). During the first night, when we were sleeping, someone entered our room and stole my phone (value ~ 1000 PLN). In the morning, when she realized to me that the door to the room was open, she alerted me to the reception desk, but the receptionist was very skeptical about me. Additionally she admitted that at night the door to our part of the building was closed and we were the only guests in that part of the building. So the miracle. The relationship between the hotel manager and the receptionist to me leaves much to be desired. Of course it was the first and last night there, the hotel manager did not give us the whole amount for the second night, generally a very bad impression. A great disappointment, I do NOT recommend it."
2926,"She's great, after all those comments she had a ambiguous opinion about her, but she decided to try me. I liked the visit very much, and that she spends little time? she didn't notice me. Every patient in front of me sat at her face. 30 minutes. She knew what she wanted, so it didn't take me long. She was afraid that she might fail me a little because I am less than 20 years old, but on the contrary. She found out everything and I am satisfied and it was very funny ; ) I will definitely get back to her."
2927,"The main hall you can see that after the renovation, modern, but the rooms are already worse. The rooms are small, cold and very modest. Compared to other hotels at the same price - massacre. The food doesn't kidnap, the waiters with grace."
2928,"They visited this place with their family during their holiday together. Right at the check-in it was necessary to pay for the whole stay in advance without seeing the room. The staff were not nice with a lot of resentment on their faces, especially the waiter from breakfast who was nervous about the fact that we were crushed while slicing bread. Breakfasts were completely unmastered (every day the same) no vegetables, lettuce or cucumber (only unripe tomatoes). There is no bottle of water in the room that would be a free addition (cost 20 cents) with a fee for a stay of more than 100 euros per day is already a small exaggeration. Parking is also paid extra 12 €. Toilet is nice made of stone ( minus the mould between the tiles ) . The maids are nice ladies to help and clean the room during the stay. However, a beautiful attraction is the panoramic elevator."
2929,"Generally I am not satisfied with the visit to the doctor: she had an appointment for a specific hour and then she came in with a 40-minute delay, once and twice she had a strange rash on the whole body presented me everything, the doctor wrote down on the computer, looked and said that the rash is very unusual and does not know what it can be from and then she prescribed the pills that did not help and did not direct further what to do and for such a service she paid m 130zł. . . The doctor herself is very sympathetic."
2930,"Encouraged by photos, location and price - she took a risk. A small room, but okay, this was supposed to be. Towels used to be white - today gray . Unbelievable stench from the sewage system in the bathroom . Warm water, but you need to be patient. The sheet washed and with a hole. But a quick Wi-Fi and good, silencing windows. Just take the stopwatches, because the air conditioner is walking all the time, could not be switched off and is noisy."
2931,"A hotel made with an idea and a coherent interior that is customized. In this hotel we feel very comfortable. Eating ok but without fireworks which in this case you do not need. The location also wins, although a piece to the center of Sopot is . I definitely recommend this place!"
2932,"Completely missed choice . The object only from the outside looks decent. Rooms not for aesthetics small stinking stinks of sewerage, dirty carpet, old beds, bed linen old washed making an impression of dirty. Arrogant owner setting up guests. Do not be fooled by the photo of the library is only wallpaper on the wall ha, ha . WIF doesn't work, the only plus is the location"
2933,"I was convinced that there is one hotel in Sopot that can provide the best quality, the bigger was my surprise with a short business stay in Little England. I had the opportunity to live in a beautiful and comfortable room of a very high standard. Nice service, which is key and often not network hotels can not cope with this, here was not such a problem. Very pleasant wellness and spa area. Excellent breakfast restaurant, beautifully decorated, breakfast without any problems and coffee. . Excellent, every coffee maker will understand. The lack of sea view was completely compensated for. I recommend and hope that this level will remain. Thank you for the nice memories."
2934,"Problems with teeth may be the cause of sinusitis, but an untreated sinus disease may also cause dental complications, e.g. loss of implants - said Dr Michał Michalik at a scientific conference in Warsaw on this subject on Friday. ""Therefore, for the patient's sake, close cooperation between laryngologists and dentists is necessary, e.g. during endodontic treatment (root canal treatment of teeth - PAP) or when inserting dental implants. Thanks to this, the treatment is shorter, more effective, avoids serious complications and is cheaper"" - said Dr Michał Michalik from the MML medical centre in Warsaw, which hosts the first interdisciplinary laryngological and dental conference in Poland, held from 27 to 28 March in Warsaw."
2935,"On Wednesday, the University also held the official opening of the Dental Simulation Centre. Students can use 60 phantom stands simulating clinical conditions. The stands are equipped with, among others, appropriate sets of jaws, teeth, rubber gums and models of the mandible for teaching block anaesthesia. ""When a few years ago we started learning on phantoms and after all the exercises we talked to our parents and colleagues, we were all jealous that we were learning so modernly. (...) It was only today that I understood the notion of jealousy, because that is what I feel today in relation to my younger colleagues"" - said Mateusz Tarnowski, a 5th year student of dentistry at the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University."
2936,"The hotel doesn't have a public parking lot but a public one that you have to pay for. Breakfast is cold only (no scrambled eggs and hot sausages). But the hit was the electric toothbrush left behind which I tried to pick up 3 weeks. Once in person, once through a colleague, was finally to be sent to my address. Then no phone or text message contact. For treating a client like an idiot I strongly advise against. You won't be able to get back what you left behind. You should take your customers seriously."
2937,"I'm writing this opinion for the second time because it's the first time I've written it on the Myphone manufacturer's website and it wasn't posted on the website : ( ! ! ! ! because the manufacturer probably didn't like it. I have had this phone for a month. He wrote em then not to buy this phone mainly because of lack of internal memory. Practically you can upload some applications and the memory is gone . Additionally when he called em to the manufacturer, they sold me out just by saying that this phone has it and they are not going to do anything about it . Probably they are going to introduce a new model e.g. Luna and the customers who have this phone will leave it alone. At my suggestion of . . . .the lady's job is to say that I'll lose my guarantee. I'd still replace the Youtube stutter with a defect. If the manufacturer would help users and somehow (update) eliminated the memory problems it would be a pretty cool phone for a decent price because the screen, speed and functionality is very decent."
2938,"You're really nice. But what about the patients after that? Three people who have the same hourly appointment, not by chance, but knowingly. You listened to what anyone had to say, you issued a prescription and told them to show up again and again and again. . . . .although you think the patient is healthy. In that case why these visits if there is no talk, there is no help either. . . It is not an art to prescribe a prescription and send it home. Therapy that the patient needs would be useful, especially if the patient has trouble talking about his problems. It is the Doctor herself who should notice, but I suspect she was too tired of erasing people all day. I'm willing to pay for the therapy, but what happened in your office was a big misunderstanding. If somebody needs a prescription I invite you to Mrs Agata, if somebody needs Therapy I advise to look for another psychiatrist."
2939,"Such facilities are mainly disposed of by state-owned companies, which in the process of privatization took over a large number of state-owned enterprises in the 1970s and 1980s. The third, the least numerous group, are facilities which have been built (or purchased) from the beginning with a view to their sale . These include Radisson Blu and Westin in Warsaw. Transactions concerning the first group of facilities are few and the amounts obtained do not exceed, as shown in the previous year, PLN 4 - 5 million. The situation is no different in the whole Europe, where larger transactions concerning facilities in an unfavourable financial situation constitute a little more than a tenth of the market."
2940,"The winners of the award - the Jaskólski - Wlodawer tandem - were selected from among 55 nominations, which were evaluated by a jury composed of outstanding representatives of the Polish and American scientific community. They received the award - and with it 5 thousand dollars each - for structural research on proteins of medical significance, which contributed to the development of new therapies for treating human diseases, such as AIDS or leukaemia in children. ""This award shows that not only one achievement in science is important, but also a long term cooperation. What Mariusz and I have been doing together for so many years has been appreciated"" - Wlodawer told PAP. ""In science, cooperation is extremely important and should be exemplified by others, including politicians, who often forget that without cooperation you cannot achieve much,"" - said Prof. Wlodawer. Jaskólski . He did not hide the fact that science has brought scientists so close to each other that they remain very close friends despite their distance."
2941,"After a few years of using the Automapa and believing it to be the best, I am sick of it. I have let myself be convinced that it is the best and in the meantime with every new update Automapa has a more and more confusing way of operating, the menu is complicated, now that many new roads are being built every time you enter an unknown road in Automapa, the program is suspended and you have to stop and start all over again. The user interface is a failure. You know when you saw 'em? How did he borrow em from a colleague's low-cost navigation system bought in a shop on B . ( for poor Poles ) with a different map . Maybe it wasn't perfect, but what a wonderfully simple way to use it, a few clicks on the big keys and you can go, what a relief it was after the constant fight with Automapa . I don't want to write any more about Automapa, please read other not very flattering opinions - they are true. I don't need to invest a lot of money in the EU version. Automapo! - Don't go that way, please, please, please, for more convenience, simplicity and transparency. . . . . . . . . P . S . I'm not a B-type or any other shop representative."
2942,"I was yesterday's first time and in addition to the fact that she was late and the delay in entry lasted 1,5 hours, so far I can say that I recommend it. The Doctor, although she didn't have to go through the heap of my piglets with the results of various (not even necessary) tests, she suggested to come to the hospital or clinic so that she wouldn't do paid tests. So far I am satisfied, we will see how it goes with further treatment. Greetings to Agnes"
2943,"She was at Dr. Krajewski's with nightmarish acne scars. Her face looked very bad, even her makeup did not cover everything. Dr . Krajewski listened to me carefully, looked through all the medical records so far and reassured me. He proposed a comprehensive treatment (chemical peelings, laser, mesotherapy). It had a calendar of treatments set up. Finally, somebody took care of me comprehensively, did not dispose of me, treated me humanely. The treatments turned out to be effective, my face looks much better now. I have also established a long-term treatment plan, so that the skin of the face looks even better. What was most important to me - Dr. Krajewski creates a sense of security, he is an excellent professional, he really knows what he is doing. He treats the patient as a partner, talks about contraindications, risks and benefits of treatments. From the beginning she knew what awaits me, what the treatment will look like, what effects I can expect. A great specialist and a good person."
2944,"It is commonly believed that green tea is very beneficial to health and is also a drink recommended during diets. Already in previous studies prof . Walkowiak and his team found that green tea also limits the absorption of fats. Does the new research mean that it is beneficial for people who fight against overweight? Professor Warmus reserves that such conclusions should be drawn carefully. ""Theoretically we are dealing here with a situation in which it would be possible to reduce or slow down the absorption of sugar from starch and thus prevent hyperglycemia or excessive sugar absorption"" - he said in an interview with PAP. Potentially this means ""some chance in the context of obesity problems, which is nowadays the size of a pandemic"" - he added ."
2945,"A beautiful place as many of you write, but that's all. . . . poor and eternally cold food, poor menu especially when you buy a dinner set. The worst thing is the offer for children, the food looks uninviting, it is also cold and unfortunately poor. . . standards far from the stars. And the management, which should probably run a hairdressing salon and not a hotel with aspirations. . . . also poorly at the reception desk - information that is mutually exclusive or incomplete . Not better in rooms - windows with wind blowing through, burnt bulbs, clogged shower drain, dirty carpet, loud air conditioning. . . . . .there are a few hotels in the area with fewer stars but with a cordial and professional approach and excellent cuisine. . ."
2946,"Technologically very interesting. Everything does the computer with the tablet at hand . From turning on the TV, to ordering food to your room. Cool, but sometimes it's better to handle it analogically. Free coffee from the coffee machine in the lobby - VERY YES! Tasty and pleasant, but I guess the ladies couldn't keep up. The parking lot is too small - who's the first one to be better - we just succeeded. Breakfast and room service correct and good, but no fireworks. Prices are very high, however, immediately reminded us of airport visits (beer 0, 33 at 14pln is a bit of a stretch). The hotel is focused mainly on foreign guests. Beds uncomfortable . Microscopic rooms . The staff did not answer the phone at the reception desk once (we tried 4). Free Wi - Fi in the whole hotel on the plus, but today it is standard. In Poznan at this price we definitely prefer Andersia with a view of the whole city."
2947,"Even if you don't need to live here or stay for a specific purpose (e.g. a horse competition, business meeting or family celebration), you must visit the palace and its surroundings. It is rare to meet with such care for the restored monument. Interior design and finishing and attention to detail and quality of materials used make us feel here in a climate like a hundred years ago, and at the same time, having of course a lot of cash, we will taste the various attractions and services at a very high level."
2948,"In the diagnosis of gastrointestinal problems - in the detection of cancer, bleeding, ulcers, parasites - endoscopic examination is useful. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a camera into the gastrointestinal tract. In traditional endoscopes, the webcam is placed on a long duct, and this makes the examination may not be too comfortable for the patient. However, less invasive solutions have already appeared on the market - webcam capsules, which you just need to swallow, and they go through the entire digestive system to record any abnormalities in the digestive system. The video is transmitted wirelessly to the receiver in the vest or belt that the patient wears. This solution applies especially to small and large intestine examination."
2949,"Very poor-quality rooms for surviving the night. . . The standard of cleanliness in the rooms is terrible and asking for the intervention of the sanitarium . The first sheet that we had to ask for anyway we got wet second one stained rather not want to know what . . . ( picture attached ) A style on which someone spent a lot of money but 20 years ago . Most of the lighting in the room does not work as in the attached photo from the 3 mounted light sources works one. . . . .tragedy. . . The service divided one of the ladies very nice and helpful the other one as if working for a punishment in this place . As far as the bathroom is concerned, it is in a very interesting style but quite clean. To sum up my argument I recommend this place only as a last resort in other cases I also recommend but avoid a very wide arch."
2950,"I'll start with the fact that she used to be in hotels 3 * and 4 * and she was very curious about what she would be 5 * . For a family trip to the seaside we chose an unusual time - what are you supposed to do there with the children in January? but I admit that it was one of the nicer stays. Location - easy access - close to the sea. Nice and helpful service. Rooms are decorated with taste, spacious, clean, bathroom also. A lot of small hotel gadgets. The restaurant offered a large selection of dishes - everyone will find something for themselves, even children.) The hotel has many attractions such that you don't have to leave it (we were just walking on the beach). The price includes all swimming pools, saunas, salt caves, playgrounds and animator's care. In the SPA - she took advantage of the massage - and she was very well taken care of. If you want to use the football pitch, squash and bowling for an extra charge, you can also use the beach. For guests there were also organized various activities, such as yoga. So it was an active relaxation ; - ) After the number of guests in the hotel and cars in the car park you can see that they do not complain about the lack of customers and I am not surprised at all. I recommend it without hesitation!"
2951,"Certainly in the case of a doctor one should assess his accurate diagnosis and treatment, but in the case of Dr. Infantry his ability to treat completely overshadows his criminal behaviour. The times are long gone when the doctor showed what kind of patients are imbeciles and in answer to questions he said that his time is very precious. She treated my son for half a year with him, endured all these comments, but recently she left my office because what right of my taxes is someone to insult me? And I will not leave it so, I will make a written complaint about the behavior of this doctor and if someone wanted to sign with me, then I think we can together change the behavior of this arrogant, because he is a really good doctor, only learned that everyone humbly endures his comments. Everyone at work has a culture, his too."
2952,"The Sound Garden Hotel, the first in Warsaw, music and self-service hotel should welcome guests in spring 2013. This will most likely happen in April. The facility with 206 rooms (377 beds), 9 conference rooms (over 600 sq m, approx. 310 beds) and a dining area (approx. 160 people) is being built in Warsaw as part of the Business Garden office and service complex at Żwirki i Wigury Street. Guests, depending on their preferences, will be able to choose floors in the style of jazz, classic, chillout, rock, silent or pop. Sound Garden is to be the first musical, but most importantly - a self-service hotel in Warsaw. After making a reservation through the website, phone or tablet, guests will be given a unique code, based on which not the receptionist, but the kiosk check - in will give them an entry card to the room. ""You do not have to stand in line to check in. You will be issued by a vending machine, but forget to check out - just have breakfast and leave"". The operator of the hotel under construction ensures that the hotel is being built."
2953,"I'm not convinced of your doctor. The visit took place in a nice atmosphere, but it did not bring anything to the matter in the sense of treatment. The documentation you have to have with you, as well as your medical history and the doctor with the artificial knee repeats for 10 minutes what is written, without any new indications. And these 10 minutes of known facts cost a lot. In my opinion, the doctor is devoid of empathy, he takes a stern approach to the patient, he does not propose new solutions, he does not take the initiative of treatment in order to satisfy the patient's needs. Of course, as a patient I am not able to assess the content of the doctor, although fortunately my intuition directed me to someone else and today I feel good. I am after the surgery and I run, jump, enjoy life - but it is not thanks to Mr. Doctor."
2954,"Hello, from the very beginning I strongly discourage everyone from staying in this hopeless place, where the guest is treated as an intruder at best! Apart from the proper appearance of the object, all the rest deserves a clear criticism. The quality of the food is similar to that of the previous system's bars, while the staff gives the impression of serving a sentence in prison. Certainly this object does not deserve 5 * or even 4 * . Moreover, after reporting a number of inconveniences, I was offered compensation, but the hotel did not meet the requirements. In a word, the hotel is a misunderstanding. Oskar Kaminski"
2955,"It was my first visit to this Doctor. Unfortunately, all these positive opinions have nothing to do with reality. The Doctor was rather cold and haughty. Moreover, the doctor's comments made me feel like a teenager with a lack of imagination and knowledge. The visit was very short, the health interview consisted of only a few questions. The receptionist put on my patient's card, which was an ordinary white A4 card. I don't recommend it and I won't be able to use it myself either. In addition, there was no price list, she paid PLN 200 for the visit, for which she didn't receive a receipt."
2956,"Opinion on the basis of the materials durability course I On the faculty : IŚ The way the course is conducted : understandable Can it teach ? Yes Basis of assessment in the course book / pass/fail: 2 colloquia Unexpected: no sense of humour: sometimes General approach to the student: positive I highly recommend, knowledge comes to mind, full credit terms."
2957,"MASAKRA ! ! ! We really are not demanding customers, but the offer on the Hotel's website has nothing to do with reality. It was supposed to be a great weekend for the kids - we really rarely have the opportunity to leave all four of us, so the trip, although short, is very much awaited. Unfortunately, after the arrival, we had the impression that we have confused our facilities - I understand that marketing, beautiful photos, the offer to attract customers, but people! ! ! we have to deliver on our promises. In the offer of the children's menu - in fact, even we, adults had nothing to choose from. For breakfasts cold scrambled eggs, sausages interchangeably with sausages + standard sausage, cheese, some vegetables - as far as possible to survive, although every day the same (a small plus for cake and fruit), dinner is not tasty - dried meat from bemaras (not to mention fish, because she would rather not remember that she tried m) . Typically for children NIC - Complete! ! ! But OK - no discussion about tastes, maybe somebody liked it (although there are many complaining families with children around - finally holidays). Unfortunately, the ubiquitous dirt effectively disgusted meals - to steam around the children's corner in the restaurant, dust from the previous year, baby chairs threatened injury or lack of possibility to unstick the child from them (leftover food from predecessors, dried stains from soups or other unidentified liquids). ...the yoghurt spilled by one of the children after 2 days simply dried on the floor - because why wash it? I understand - children will get dirty anyway, but without exaggeration! ! ! ! After the second visit in the restaurant, she asked the waiter to wipe the child's chair - you wouldn't want to see what a white cloth looked like after this procedure: (Tablecloth on Sunday breakfast like a harmonica - clean, but pressed, as if a dog's throat was taken out. About food enough. The neighborhood really has potential - in the summer, for sure, beautiful and green, now something dug up there, something closed, and in the middle of the lake in the dorsal style floats a dead fox - a wonder of nature! If it wasn't for the fact that most of the attractions for children are only open on Saturdays and Sundays, we would come back after 1 day. The sealarium is really great - no reservations here: ) The zoo is also worth seeing. Standard room, quite a nice decor, comfortable beds (a cot for a child again after the passages - it would be useful for him to clean, but let's not get carried away). The small bathroom, the entrance directly to the mouthpiece is quite surprising, only the painting tape around the lamp pointed with insect faeces spoiled the general reception a bit. And the hairdryer - washed my young girl's hair after swimming pool chlorine, I grabbed the hairdryer and horrible! it stuck to my hand - I do not know if it's a mistake in cleaning, because the coating as if it was slightly dissolved (with a layer of sticky dust) - disgusting! I went to the pool once - the best times are behind me, a little bit of falling parts such as a nozzle from the Jacuzzi lying loose next to the pool basin, a broken children's board, a paddling pool quite deep, but it is. After the general impressions, we did not want to use the SPA anymore. The toddler's corner is open 10 - 18, and after 18 if you do not go to the pool you have nothing to offer the children. Nice roomy . General conclusions - never again! ! !"
2958,"The castle on the rock is very disappointing. We didn't feel like eating after what we saw. At the entrance to the restaurant the smell of chlorine is unpleasant, while inside the smell of kitchen - which bothers me personally. They looked through the sticky menu card and gave up the next meal. Dust everywhere, maybe it is such a style - I do not know. For me it was a big disappointment, because she expected me to have a beautiful restaurant and not the ubiquitous dust and smell of food as in an inferior eatery."
2959,"A very pleasant person, student friendly, speaks by name which improves the relationship very much. . . . .not 'cause I'm not in"
2960,"I have been cooperating with Mrs. Kasia for some time now and I can't even estimate how much this cooperation helps me, because 5 stars is certainly not enough. Mrs. Kasia is not only a warm, polite and funny person, but most of all a professional who can ""straighten up"" even the most vulnerable of the charges: ) He listens very well, he always gets to the heart of the matter and makes the man himself attracted to healthy food. At meetings you can expect hard work, but also later on - measurable effects. Invaluable support and a unique motivator. I wholeheartedly recommend ."
2961,"The Doctor was very nice, she did a detailed interview, did a thyroid ultrasound and due to the good results she offered only supplementation and preventive examinations in six months. I deduct one asterisk for the fact that the visit started almost an hour later than scheduled due to the doctor's late arrival."
2962,"The hotel has already had its glory years behind it, but prices remain too high. 390 PLN for a standard room is an overstatement. He asked em at the reception desk for a room reasonably low and close to the elevator because they have no smoking rooms and he wanted 'em close to the court. He got 'em a room on the 3rd floor and as far away from the elevator as possible, which is an extreme room at the end of the corridor. Parking 45zł for hotel guests, tight places, so about the car upholstery by a neighbor very easily. There is no socket in the room by the bedside to be able to recharge the phone overnight. Actually, there is only a desk socket (except for the vacuum cleaner in the hallway). Wi - terribly annoying, every time you lose range you have to log in again and in addition only one device, so you have to choose whether you have a laptop or a phone. Polish channels in TV literally a handful, programs c + additionally paid 20 PLN. In hotels, more channels are half the price, including c + channels. Air conditioning on the lowest run is noisy, but at least drowned out traffic and trams. Soundproof windows may have been in the 90s now it is a massacre. The price of a mini bar is some kind of total abstraction, 15 PLN for a can of coca-cola, so it's 900%. The only advantages are location and breakfast. There will be no return."
2963,"I regret to say that the goods do not match the shop description. I wanted to have a maximum power of 1500 W . And that's what he found 'em in the shop. It turns out that this kettle uses 1630 watts. Very uncoordinated by the seller. Secondly, the base of this kettle is disturbingly light and without rubber bands on its feet. Nothing much, but imagine a child pulling the cable. Then the lightweight plastic will slip off the top. That's why you need to put some non-slip mother under the base of the kettle. All in all, I should return the kettle, but I won't do it. I just don't want to rock with this cardboard for the post office. I know one thing, this shop ( MediaExpert ) I won't trust anymore. The description on the site is VERY important. I've been deliberately misled. 1630 is not 1500W . Correct it . Don't let anybody else push on you anymore . . . I also see in the censor's office the false information about 1500W . . ."
2964,"The hotel has been a regular guest for five years, a magical place by a climatic lake with good cuisine based on local products with a lot of fish. A large aquapark, a large hotel so it was easy to have peace, quiet and relaxation. . . A year ago the buffets passed by themselves, scallops, snails, venison, kangaroo cutlet, excellent for several years strogon boeuf, large selection of fish, both hot and cold. These flavors remembered 'em. After all, you could relax in the lobby bar with a bottle of beer ""fresh"" or a glass of wine. And for that I will repeat the peace again. . . Encouraged by a four-fold fantastic vacation, completed with all-day relaxation in the saunas, salt cave and aquapark pools, I went to Pigeon for another. The year 2017 holiday time to start . The first impression was made by the reception, this year a nice surprise, because we came to the hotel thickly before the time, but we were offered a room at once without having to wait for a fixed hour check in. We even offered us a room with no problem at all and we would be happy to go for a walk in Santa Claus. . . . .plus for hotel staff . I felt fair as a guest you are waiting for. Two hot spots in the room, half an hour of spinning at the panel and the temperature of 28 degrees, ok contact the reception - as an explanation the lady at the reception desk corrected that there is no air conditioning in the rooms and the ""cooling system"" so it will certainly not be as cool as with a classic air conditioner. Okay, but if I report it, I'll send the conservator. Here's another plus, because the restorer was already after 5 minutes, a quick check-up and bingo - the aerated system - after five minutes was after the problem, cool, nice, pleasant. Congratulations to such an employee - I think so far ok. From this place a heartfelt applause for the maids - quick cleaning, towels changed every day, the room perfectly vacuumed, all in all the plus. Ok if you have survived the stitches so far, you will probably think what the guest is picking on. . . . .then let's move on. Buffets - the food is correct, fresh but - for dinners in addition to the brilliant cheeks of beef and snails with garlic butter more and more fried sausage, neck, and next to the wonderful Masurian fish and sterin (poultry or fish) minced meat. . . . .until I was afraid to ask if it was made from a can. The second point of alcohol - the size of the drinks served does not satisfy even the dwarf - long island in this size is a mockery and the price of 50zl is a bad joke. Beer 12 zloty - okay, but the wine weathered and warm is a big fusion. The late coffee served again in a glass for about 200ml is another minus. Quite a long wait for the realization of the order - with an occupancy rate of about 30% in the lobby bar - you have to wait over 30 minutes for a glass of wine. And now the core of which hotel I will not choose again. It was quiet and calm, and here suddenly. . . On the balconies it was loud even after 10:00 p.m. and it was thick. The speakers with music (reigning Zenon Martyniuk and similar rhythms) brought beer from nearby Orlen and running with a terrifying scream in the corridors of children. In fact, they are not surprised because I would run myself if my parents would party in my room. It's just a wonder if there are no suitable places in the hotel? For example, a disco in the underground or a bar at the marina. It's a wonder that it's better to drink beer from Orlen in your room than from the hotel bar, terrorizing the rest of your guests with its rude and loud behaviour. Children run around, the beer is pouring and every second k-word in disco polo rhythm. . . . a ch . . . . . .etc. Where did these parties come from in the rooms with their own alcohol, it wasn't. Is that what you're aiming for, dear Hotel Gołębiewski? The question is, I could always report too loud, a party, etc . . . . . . .but that's not the point. The point is that during these few years the type of customers of Hotel Gołębiewski has changed a lot. It is becoming more and more difficult to meet here a gentleman in a suit, but the proverbial Janusz in socks for sandals. Sad but real . I have to rest from Pigeon, the first time I want to go back to . . . . home"
2965,"We were in Grand Lubicz with a family of five from 22 to 27 February 2015. We were delighted. The hotel has been operating since October, everything is clean and new, fantastic swimming pools, children's playrooms and meals are poetry. The food on the five with a plus various, fresh and very good. The staff is young, smiling and very nice. Comparing this hotel to Gołębiewski, in terms of price and visual, wins without a doubt Grand Lubicz. I recommend to rest with and without ten and without. We are already planning a visit in the summer. From 3 pm to 7 pm the children are taken care of free of charge. Greetings to Mr. Łukasz from Emilka ."
2966,"I'm not a demanding man, but this hotel was a complete failure. The modern bathrooms turned out to be rooms from the early 80's if not 70's. Don't suggest you take pictures of them because I'll be happy to share my own, which are certainly not even close to those published by the hotel. The hotel is located on the outskirts of the city in the vicinity of the demolished warehouses or factories, which had a ""beautiful"" view from the window. The entrance from the squalid courtyard - we barely found it) . The water in the shower flew if too many guests did not take a bath at that time (when she was taking a shower and her husband was washing his hands in the sink next door - I ran out of water to rinse). In the toilet under the ceiling pipes wrapped in some grey rags. Massacre ! ! ! ! The room was very average - no fridge or TV (for comparison, in a 2-star hotel in Berlin it was all ! ! ! ! ! ! ) . For the first breakfast we ate bakery products from 3-4 days ago, because they didn't roll when slicing, they fell into breadcrumbs. On the second day of breakfast there was a hunt for anything, because it was already at 9. At 00 there was almost nothing. Thank God the third breakfast ate me already at home. It is good that the room was on the 2nd floor, because no force would have dragged me into the elevator - it was certainly from the 70s! The corridors were dirty - painted as in old schools with a terrible lamp, there were holes in the floor after the fallen tiles. It is a pity that such a squalid place destroyed the beautiful impressions of this wonderful city - do not take this hotel! ! ! !"
2967,"I was at Mrs. Malinowska's house a few times and everything seemed to be going in a nice atmosphere, but I had the impression that the doctor was not involved in the consultations. She answered the questions as if she did not want to hear more. She came to me for a check after a spontaneous miscarriage. She was recently in another early pregnancy. When asked about the formalities related to the pregnancy, the doctor was not very interested in it. Doctor, I think you lost your routine. I will entrust my pregnancy to another doctor."
2968,"Once again, he is staying in a four-star hotel and you find the reason why someone once admitted this star. It's okay for me, but I think these four stars are way too much. The rooms are neat and tidy, the bathroom is tiny but it worked. The biggest disappointment for me was the recreation and meals. In the first issue expected me to have a gym and left me two bikes and a treadmill. Aha . The pool is also not very big. In general, despite the crowd of guests, no one has ever been there. As for the food is breakfast - Swedish table ok but the quality of served ingredients leaves much to be desired. Maybe that's how I got it. Anyway, during the whole stay I had stomach problems just after having breakfast. I also did not like the behavior of the restaurant staff who did not allow to drink coffee or tea after the evening because it was available only to foreign guests. The rest is a plus."
2969,"Always ! Therefore, let's focus our efforts: first of all, to make the conference service always better than before; and secondly, to always exceed the competition. Please note that in this place, we will always be moving in the hotel's existing resources. With the right staff, the only investment will be the staff time. Looking at the hotel industry from the side one can have the impression that the biggest problem is the poor segmentation of own services. It leads to an attempt to sell the offer to people and groups, which in most cases are not the target segments."
2970,"Kap Cafe is a place with a soul. In the very centre of the town Chapels, a tastefully renovated tenement house has been adapted for a great hotel, café and mini cultural centre with live music, exhibitions of works and crafts. We stayed for one night, but all we had to do was to like this place with its hospitality, tasteful décor and relaxed atmosphere. A great hotel, competent service, delicious breakfast."
2971,"She spent 2 days 03 - 04 at the Hotel Dosłońce. 09 . 2015 . If you are looking for a place cut off from the hustle and bustle of the city this is the perfect place . The hotel is situated in a field, there is nothing around. Writing there is nothing I am literal. Around there are only fields, forest and farms. The smell outside the hotel was unpleasant (because of the fertilizers taken to the field). The location also means that the only way to get around is to transport yourself. I came to this hotel from Warsaw and had the impression that I was going to the end of the world. And what is very important in the hotel is a very poor coverage in the PLUS network, she could talk on the phone only in front of the hotel in one place in the parking lot. So much for the location. As for the hotel itself, there are modern, nice and clean rooms decorated with taste. The food in the restaurant is tasty, nicely served. The conference room is spacious, air-conditioned with access to daylight. Professional and courteous service. The hotel has a swimming pool which compensates for the lack of entertainment in the area. Evenings can be spent in the hotel bar."
2972,He used 'em to stay overnight and the conference room where he was training 'em. The hotel in some places is a bit like from the previous era . But it has a great service. Discreet courtesy rarely encountered among the entire staff including administrative staff and sudden and unexpected entry at the beginning of the training with a tray of cups with delicious and hot chocolate enchanted me and all participants of the training . I beg you. . . . .do not change. . . . .continue to be so beautifully hospitable. . .
2973,"A middle-class hotel. Definitely too high price in relation to the quality of the facility. Breakfast is not crazy, but you can eat. Generally. - Uninteresting cuisine. When it comes to card dishes / lunch / - a small selection / 3 dishes / and not tasty. In addition, you can include LAZIENKA - shelves, shelves, hangers, and the most important BIDET. ! ! ! What a luxury when after a day of running / sightseeing / you can sit on the stool / and how it was equipped / and soak your sore feet. You said OK . Then the hotel parking lot, and the elevator. Clean rooms - daily service . The offer says that they help in arranging trips, but it turned out that only with a guide speaking a foreign language - ""Polish - not""."
2974,"An interesting solution for hotels struggling with financing problems was presented by the independent hotel group Magnuson Hotels. On the occasion of the launch of a new brand group Premier Collection , hotels of this brand , or facilities of other Magnuson brands , such as Magnuson Hotel , Magnuson Grand Hotel and M Star Hotel , gain access to a quick ( possible one day ) credit from the company Ascentium Capital . The facilities may apply for a loan of up to 250 thousand. The facilities can apply for a loan of up to $250,000 for the period from 24 to 72 months."
2975,"I highly recommend . Weekly family stay - me, wife, son, daughter and child. Two rooms in building B combined. The standard of rooms after the recent renovation is high - large rooms, spacious wardrobes. At every step you can see the hotel preparation for family stays with small children. Three meals a day, varied, tasty, everyone will find something for themselves. Swimming pools, saunas, playgrounds, spas, entertainers - you can not leave the building. At every step of the way, the staff smiles. There is no other such hotel in Poland with such a focus on the family. I highly recommend, we will definitely come back not once."
2976,"How we arrived at the hotel, from the outside and inside it makes a nice impression at first sight. But it wasn't quite like that. In short: one curtain doesn't cover the whole window, for hot water in the shower in the morning you have to wait a little bit, the food from the card if available is below any standards (she never ate m cocktail of shrimp in ketchup and horseradish sauce), bowling is barely working, the water in the pool so cold that you can't enter, when it comes to the jacuzzi it's big, it's a pity only that it worked one third of it. Generally very expensive, but if there was to be a standard * * * * * then affordable prices, it is a pity that the standard was rather * * . I don't recommend it."
2977,"""More and more people are giving up eating dairy products. There are various reasons for this, such as lactose intolerance, allergies to one of the main ingredients of milk - casein, or simply deciding to switch to a vegan diet. However, it is worth remembering that products which are formed as a result of the action of milk fermenting bacteria - such as yoghurts or kefirs - have a very positive impact on health,"" says PAP Klaudia Wojtachnio from the Warsaw University of Technology's Herbion scientific circle. ""Hence the popularity of substitutes for these products, such as yoghurts based on coconut or rice milk,"" she adds. The members of the circle to which Klaudia Wojtachnio belongs - students of biotechnology - decided to use the knowledge gained during their studies and create their own equivalent of traditional yoghurt. They decided to use millet for its production. ""It is mainly cheap and easily available in Poland"" - stresses PAP's interlocutor. She also points out that this cereal is full of nutrients: you can find in it, among others, phosphorus, silicon, iron or vitamins B1 and B2."
2978,"The location enables walking to the centre. The rooms are perfectly good quality. Swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi - great and included in the room price. Food is good - definitely too much ; - ) ) . The New Year's Eve party was organized flawlessly - we had a great time. A lot of staff - they were wondering how we could keep it that way. Parking by the hotel - large, cleanly lit and fenced. The lift works flawlessly. I have no reservations - I sincerely recommend it."
2979,"I've had 'em with this gentleman, course but, but: ) 5.0 for all the attendance, one possible without making up, more - you have to make up for it if you want to have a pile. The course is nice and pleasant, but you have to run after the ball, so I often stood on goal: ) No stress, no tests or other bullshit, at the beginning of the warm-up, team selection and driving. I recommend it warmly."
2980,"A very pleasant hotel. Picturesque location, clean and spacious rooms. The rooms either have no fridge or are broken - it does not cool, it warms! Wifi does not work in the rooms, only near the reception. You can connect to the room with a cable, but nowadays wifi is the norm, so very big minus for that! The pool is big. Unfortunately the children's wading pool was closed. The zoo is accessible by car, which was not a problem. In the zoo it is difficult to see some animals on the islets. I suspect it's even harder to see them from a boat. The entrance costs 18 zloty, I think it's too much that the zoo is not worth the price. We recommend the sealarium. Interestingly conducted training and seal show. Generally, it was pleasant, but we were not delighted with this place enough for us to want to go back there, and it's a pity, because the website looks all great."
2981,"A very pleasant hotel. One drawback was the lack of air conditioning in the room (which on the top floor was extremely unpleasant, despite the fact that we were dumb in September). Every day the maids vacuumed, there were fresh towels (5), there was a lot of food, quite a variety of dinners, although for breakfast was a permanent package. The pool inside was clean, with sea water filtered, outside was water directly from the sea. The service was cordial, helped when needed. Overall, our memories of this lounge are very positive and we highly recommend it."
2982,"In the Hostel Gate has been many times over the last few years. I don't sleep there anymore and I don't recommend it to anyone. Why? At the beginning I was delighted: great location, great breakfast, nice, clean rooms and bathrooms, nice service. Unfortunately, that was a few years ago. . . The hostel clearly needs refreshing! And that immediately! The furniture in the rooms is literally falling apart, the towels are washed to the limit, the pillows don't even look like them, and the dirty, stained mattresses on the beds are just disgusting! And the most important problem of the hostel - BRUD! I don't know, maybe we in Silesia have different standards, but for me, the floor is barely wiped with a dirty rag is not clean! And one more word about the staff. It is strange to them to tell guests ""good morning"" . I understand that these are young people for whom perhaps working in a hostel is not a dream come true, but the basic principles of good manners apply to everyone, and even more so in such a place. To sum up. It is a great pity. . . Until recently, it was my favourite hostel and I recommended it to everyone who visited Krakow. Unfortunately, those times are over. Please renovate it, and I'll definitely come back."
2983,"The hotel is a confirmation of the greatest advantages of chain hotels. There is a specific standard that is almost always met and you know what to expect. In Novotel the level is set quite high. The functional, clean rooms. The bathroom is very decent. Separate toilet. There is a double bed in each room, but there is also a sofa bed if it would be more advisable to have a separate bed: ) . You can make coffee, tea or cocoa. Breakfast is very good, and for Dutch conditions, it's even great. The service is very nice and patient (after a few attempts it has dealt with everything that must be on the Polish invoice :). ) . Location primarily for motorists or using the nearby airport. Very large car park by the hotel ."
2984,"A physician in kind, he certainly knows his job, but he will look and face a la ""Terminator"". ...can scare you off, sometimes it's hard to talk to the doctor. However, he could devote more time to his patients and once a year smile once in the Russian year, and he can, he really saw me personally that even joking is able to, unfortunately why so rarely?"
2985,"A very good doctor, after 3 years of incompetent treatment by other gastroenterologists, was in depression - constantly diarrhea and uninterrupted bleeding from the intestines. When she came to your doctor she had anemia and a terrible pain on the left side. On the good day she got an extra medicine after a month the disease went back. After a year the steroid drug was discontinued and she had been knocking off for over a year with no symptoms of relapse. Of course the doctor recommended an acute diet of zero fried fish with omega acids and zero milk and its derivatives. All steamed and cooked. I am satisfied and finally lives like any healthy person."
2986,"Today he didn't take me in with a damaged hand after the fall. He didn't even look at his bandaged hand. He was busy with the computer. I'm 65 years old, I'm lonely. The doctor told me to go to the emergency room across town. I can't afford to take a taxi to get to the clinic with a sick hand and the temperature outside was ok. 30 degrees. . . When asked if they were doing X-rays at the clinic, he arrogantly replied that he did not know. What disappointed me most was that he didn't even look at his hand, she could have had an open fracture under his flag he didn't care."
2987,"A good approach to the patient / a nice and friendly man / And he does not rip off too much / was em in a private office / . I liked the fact that the doctor admitted that he didn't know something - I don't know about it - it's not my department / for me it's a big plus / . He made a good diagnosis, he was always ready for a consultation on the phone / frequented that he called 'em because he didn't know something there / . I give you four with a plus because the first treatment was ineffective / acute prostatitis / the second time it went very well."
2988,"We got a room where the door to the other room was closed, of course. When the neighbors came, they told us that we could hear every word spoken in the adjoining room. So I asked them to replace the room, so the lady at the reception gave us another room but with separate beds, in addition we had to move late at night, which does not enhance the feeling of comfort, I advise you to put soundproofing between these rooms or not to use this apartment as two separate rooms. Apart from that, the decoration of the rooms is definitely different from the standard expected from the MERCURE network, it's a pity because the location and the building actually has potential."
2989,"Very good doctor, accurate diagnosis, quick decision, precise treatment and after the pain. Substantial, factual, just a professional. After the procedure 2 weeks / L 5 - 6 / and works quite well. Everyone who has operated with me and before is very satisfied with the treatment and is recovering. No post-operative complications. Sutures made majestically. I really recommend Dr. Janusz, he is a great neurosurgeon."
2990,"Lecture "" Think p lithium"
2991,"I hope time has done its work! That the negative opinions read here will not be confirmed and after the procedure - septoplasty - I will be able to join the ""best"" opinion. Currently, I am after a study (in the centers independent of Dr. Kozok - outside Krakow), which confirm the diagnosis of Dr. Kozok. I have an appointment for the surgery and I am preparing for it. I am treating with Dr . I have an appointment to treat Dr. Kozok's sinuses and throat so that no infection can occur in the perioperative period, which can cause complications. The questions to my predecessors - forum users - are as follows: 1 - is it possible to estimate our life and health - please give the value ( ? ??? ), 2 - is medical care in other countries completely free of charge and the standard of medical services does not depend on financial possibilities, not only of medical institutions, but also the status of the patient. . . . . . . ? ? ? Such questions multiply in the minds of the sick. . . . . Let us also think about what the expenses of chronically ill people look like . Let us also think about the degree of our awareness and knowledge of the illnesses we suffer from, and we will not be, in a way, supposedly, overwhelmed by various specialists. We, too, have a considerable influence on the therapies that are ""funded"" by specialists. I would add that my financial situation is very average. I promise to write objectively and honestly, in 2 - 3 months' time, already a short but factual opinion on dr . Kozok. With respect to all the forumgoers and Dr. Kozok. Kozok."
2992,"An arrogant, unaspirate and rude man. He did not inspire my trust. The Doctor was giving me a few simple answers to the questions I asked him. He asked me about my course of study, but when she answered me she met me with a mocking smile and comments, which was very sad. The doctor prescribed me drugs which caused me a terrible stomach ache and the effects of these drugs on the problem I reported were not visible. During a visit to another orthopedist showing the medicines that she received from Dr. Zwinczewski did not even comment and wrote down others. Dr. Zwinczewski also stated that there is a need for knee injections. She wanted me to point out that I am less than 24 years old. She got scared of it, so she consulted me with the above mentioned other orthopedist. So far she has not had any injections into her knees and I hope that I will never have . The visit lasted maybe 10 minutes, but the delay was an hour. The waiting room is chaotic, it is crowded, there is nowhere to sit, people are nervous because of the long delays. I am not satisfied with the services of this gentleman. By paying, I require a full, conscious commitment to my treatment from the person treating me. Not when I no longer use the services of this office."
2993,"After more recent traumatic experiences with the first 8th hour of the rip-off, I finally found myself pregnant with your doctor. Fate wanted that just in this period (pregnancy) I had to remove another 8. Mr. Dr. was by way of a nice, professional, kind and humorous. I swear that I didn't know at what point he pulled this cursed tooth out. In addition, I didn't have to take any pain killers after this surgery. Good luck with the pregnancy, because you can only get a good appetite. So I took one for the night and there was no more need. No swelling, nothing. Wonderful doctor and I'm sorry that there's no contract with nfz anywhere because I have a third 8 to remove. (I commend Mr. Dr. with a clear conscience. A professional doctor, the best in his field. Greetings Sandra"
2994,"The hotel was very bad quality, definitely not worth 4 stars. The room was devastated: the door of the bathroom was closing with difficulty, at the hinge of the inside of the bathroom were cracked, the top by the washbasin was also cracked, dirty carpet with black spots in the room, the exhaust vent in the room was dusty and dirty. definitely not recommended. The only advantage was a comfortable bed and a wellness area (swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi, basic equipment for exercise). The hotel is in a busy place, the room is noisy and at night there is noise from the street. On the hotel's website there is information that there are bathrobes in the room, which turned out to be untrue because there are no bathrobes in the standard room."
2995,"Unfortunately, we came to Saturday and there was no sleeping! ! ! under the apartments disco until 5 am very loud. I do not recommend this place. At night we wanted to look for another night, the massacre of a child could not sleep we too. Bringing suitcases on the high floor is also an art I do not recommend and pay attention to Saturday if someone wants to sleep is out of the question."
2996,"Beautifully located hotel about 1 km from the center of Szklarska Poreba. Spacious, aesthetic apartments equipped with basic amenities and kitchen utensils, seating area and comfortable beds. We occupied our room on the fifth floor with a side view of the mountains. We were pleased with the spacious and extended swimming pool area, with the external part. The whole is complemented by a very nice service, a tasty breakfast served until 11 o'clock. The room has a spacious parking lot. We spent two pleasant days in this place. The hotel fulfilled our expectations. The only small disappointment was at the swimming pool, when it turned out that the outdoor area is only open until 20. 00 . In all informants there is a time of 22 . 00 . We came at 19 . 55 and we wanted to use the external jacuzzi, and an extremely rude lifeguard, in a very rude tone, declared that he closes this part and the information about the opening hours is on the exit door. We watched this gentleman later and behaved quite unpleasantly towards all guests, giving orders rather than making a request. Apart from this small inconvenience, we experienced many pleasant moments in this hotel."
2998,"I have to say, the hotel has set the bar high...) It was wonderful and perfect: from a quick check-in, through a very nice smell left for us in our room every day to a great and tasty breakfast every morning. The omnipresent smile of the staff. . . . .but no, the staff in this case is an ugly word. . . the smile of the Wonderful People who, it seems to me, are passionate about doing what they do, and about us. I will not describe what always, what for breakfast, what in the room, because there was nothing that bothered us, we felt at home and that was probably what it was all about: ) This is our second stay in this hotel and certainly not the last one, it was great!"
2999,"The advantage is the building at the slope, although the boxed building is a forgotten zero contribution to maintaining conditions on the slope. He heard 'em talking to two centuries old gentlemen (skiers) were here 20 years ago and nothing has changed. Nothing is done to stop the skiers, total neglect of the slopes is better to go downhill on a haystack than on skis. Only in summer. Beskid sports arena is the future of Szczyrk. I return to Olimpia lux szczyrk, lux is too much, the owners should have paid for the renovation of the facility long ago. Nowadays, the old wainscot and dusty blankets are a sorry but stretching the client. It's not worth the stay there for a day 650 zl for 2 old rooms. They go for the amount of money and not for quality. I was reminded of the time of the holidays of 1987 . Not for that price, not this facility . The hotel service is nice, breakfast is good, cold pool not for children. You can fall ill after it. If you like the Neglected Skrzymark, the old hotel is actually on the slope."
3001,"I recommend it ! ! ! Many hotels do not have a standard like this hostel! ! The service is very nice and helpful! The lady at the reception desk gave me many valuable tips on where to eat well, what to visit and how to move around the city. The cozy room, the bathrooms, the toilets are clean, and there is also a locker room for personal items. Close to the centre and the train station. You can leave your luggage after check-out!"
3008,"90% of the 500,000 accommodation facilities available on the kayak.pl website allow their guests to use Wi - Fi at no extra charge . In the comparison of European countries with the highest percentage of hotels with free Wi - Fi , Poland was on the second position, and in general, including facilities around the world, on the fifth position. ""Does your hotel offer free access to the Internet? ” This is certainly one of the more frequent questions hoteliers have been hearing from their guests for several years. More and more people cannot imagine their holidays without using gadgets such as a smartphone, tablet or laptop. Thus, free Wi Fi in a hotel becomes, next to the location or number of stars, the basic factor when choosing a place to stay. Kayak's research * has shown that 90 percent of the hotels around the world analysed by the service can freely use the Internet without paying extra fees. The overall ranking was followed by America (94%), Europe (90%), Asia (88%), Africa (81%) and Oceania (55%). On a country-by-country basis, Romania (99%), Vietnam (99%) and Taiwan (98%) were on the podium."
3009,"The hotel is located a large piece from the center of Kolobrzeg, so for weak walkers or non-motorized people it can be a problem. To the beach ok . 500 m walk, very nice path. For me the place itself is ok, away from the hustle and bustle in a quiet area. The food is very good, everyone will find something for themselves. Breakfast buffet: standard scrambled eggs and sausages for dinner a few hot dishes plus a buffet with cheese sausages etc . She had a room in the newer part of the hotel, so very nice, clean, neat, well-maintained, all fragrant. The service was very nice. The swimming pool is small, but it always is, the water is a little too cold, the sauna is large, so it is very good because it can easily accommodate several people. The steam bath is small but as there are no crowds in the hotel is ok. Nearby there are no chain stores, only small housing estates, no assortment frenzy. I generally recommend! !"
3010,"We are generally satisfied with the stay ( two days ) . The service is very nice and helpful. Clean rooms . In the bar and fast food bar where the food is of medium quality, a little cooled down because it is lying on the counter for a few hours, but if you do not have great requirements, at least it will eat really cheap. Breakfast included in the price was great, Swedish table, fresh food and more varied than in most 3-star hotels. Spent up to 11. The breakfast was very much appreciated by us. We got one of the best rooms, although far from the apartment as it is called. Unfortunately, the windows overlook a busy street and there is no question of a comfortable morning with the windows open (with the windows closed not much better). This is a big minus. . . The equipment in the room irritated me a little - the bedside lamp is falling apart, there is no trash can in the room, an extra bed for a child is an inflatable mattress, which by midnight was already soft (annoying). Personally, I don't like small cushions that I have to sleep on either. Bed linen and towels look new and are certainly good quality. I don't like extension cords, thieves in sockets and the like. It's neither safe nor pretty. . . Generally: for breakfasts and atmosphere I give 5 but for the underdevelopment, extra bed and no lift to the 2nd floor I give 2. Total strong plus 3."
3011,"I am glad that she found me Dr. Dydymski - she was interested in a prestigious clinic - so she trusted my recommendations: VERY GOOD LEADER! I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE ! If somebody writes that he is not nice - I don't think we are talking about that doctor! He is very modest, forgiving, competent and composed! I have been in surgery for a month and I have been in contact with Doctor e - mail because of the distance - I know that I can always count on an answer. He has the highest level of knowledge - I am surprised that people only after consultation - give themselves the right to assess their qualifications! I live in the east of Poland - I visited three doctors who did not even know how to take off the stitches that you can not see: ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .but the same doctors said. . . . . . ""Well done."" ) ) Greetings !"
3012,"The hotel is located in a beautiful area, away from the hustle and bustle of the street, right by the stream. As for the interior, it is very clean and modern. The rooms are equipped with a very good access to wifi and a 3d television and internet. The rooms are cleaned daily. The owners and staff are very kind and helpful. I recommend that you buy breakfast, all fresh, large selection, you can even order omelette, fried eggs or hot sausages. The hotel has a swimming pool, the size of which is sufficient, as well as numerous water massages and saunas. We recommend it, we are sure to be there one day. . ."
3016,"I go into the hotel and the first thing I think of is that there was a renovation. He was em last time in this hotel in 2008, it looked exactly the same as 1982, when they were making the film Wielki Szu. For good morning I waited for myself at the reception ok . 5 min . The receptionist eagerly and cheerfully chatted in the back, having guests somewhere. Only the passing chef called out and took an interest in me. At that time, I also read the information that the hotel is currently changing for me and is being renovated. It's a pity that there wasn't this information about how I booked a room on the hotel website. The plus is that they got 'em a room away and didn't hear 'em banging and drilling, but it wasn't better at all. . . As for the room, it's such a slightly refreshed game. Except that the windows of this Gierek still remember, e.g. my window, to close (it was open when I entered the room) it took a really lot of strength. Gierek's technology was also made, the ventilation shafts were connected with each other. He heard 'em talking on the cell phone when the guy next door was talking, he heard 'em also when a drunk or on drugs guy upstairs to 1 a.m. was talking, laughing, yelling. Everything can be perfectly heard through the ventilation. . . The only advantages: a decent breakfast and no parking problem. Even with cleanliness not too good, I stuck a piece of glass or plastic in my foot. It looked like a broken pen, but you didn't look at 'em carefully, you just threw 'em out. Also vacuumed probably from the holidays. I'll never come back! Absolutely not worth the price because the conditions are like in a workers' hotel."
3017,"Encouraged by the opinions from this portal I went to Mr. Sławomir . Unfortunately, my opinion about him is completely different from the opinions of patients, which have been placed here . He was unpleasant to me and did not listen to the comments that he made to em . He was immediately nervous to find out more about the diagnosis he had made."
3018,"Some of the reasons why I don't recommend it to you: 1) Everyone knows that you have to romance with a patient, explain why you do this particular examination, what is the result of the examination and diagnosis, etc... In the case of the doctor, I was supposed to get information from her, ask her what is going on and how she asked me a question, she answered me using terminology that I do not understand. For example, ""this is an IGM test"". I am not a doctor, I want them to speak to me in simple language that I understand. 2 ) It seems to me that your doctor is not a good specialist in rheumatology. She did a blood test for Lyme disease (arthritis). You read the test to me like this: ""Oh, so what, you have Lyme disease? ""( question for me ) . What did she say to me that you were the one to tell me what I had. Then the doctor started to read me loudly how to read the result of the test, which indicates that she was not sure if I had Lyme disease or not. 3) The doctor never smiles. I don't think she likes what she does. 4) The doctor is late for an appointment."
3019,"Mr. Luke came to me at the end of my pregnancy because of the fear that I couldn't cope with the pain of childbirth. Luckily, I was sent to Mr. Luke who found a solution to help me relieve the pain and proposed a device called TENS. It was hard for me to believe that such a small device could help, but it worked! ! ! and helps in relieving the pain of childbirth, thanks to Mr. Luke and the device TENS managed to survive the whole childbirth and managed to cope with the pain, I really recommend : - ) . I am skipping the fact that Mr. Łukasz is probably the only physiotherapist in Bydgoszcz who offers his help to pregnant women in the fight against labour pain by renting a TENS device. Mr. Lukasz approaches the whole matter very professionally and explains very precisely whether he relies on and how the TENS device works. Once again, thank you very much for your help in the fight against pain and professional approach. It is good to know that there is a person who approaches with full commitment to what he does."
3021,"Hotel very neglected. The rooms are dirty, the walls are sleeping, it looks like they were not cleaned at all. The bedding is dirty, not even washed with bloodstains - pillows, sheets. The bathroom is dirty! no running drain, no equipment! In general, the hotel is also all dirty. Ubiquitous dust!"
3022,"She tried to book a room for two nights with a child who would turn 8 years old on the second day/night of her stay and the nasty receptionist said that we have to pay for an extra bed - so I persistently / a little bit perversely - was digging into the subject of why we should pay for the first night, when the child will still be 7 years old (it's not about money, but about the principle and the proclamation of the hotel!) . The receptionist suggested that we do not have to come to them if it does not suit me. . . . .I already know how these little flattering opinions come about. The hotel + service in any case I do not recommend at all. On request to contact the manager - of course - no possibility ; - ) Comedy just."
3023,"The customers from the groupon are treated as second category in this hotel. . . The dinner was terrible, the soup was acidic, the meat was dry and the cake was served as ""old and hard"" dessert. The kitchen is hopeless. Waiters who are not nice and unprofessional. restaurant and garden neglected! Even though the restaurant has a beautiful view of the lake, you can't take advantage of it because the tables are dirty and sunken. stay is not worth the price!"
3026,"Dirt, once again dirt, gray toilet paper, broken shower from which spills water from the sink all over the cabin because it is leaking, the sink is clogged, over the bed the hand is not working, microscopic tv no remote control, it is too small for the bed so it is missing from half a meter, after the 4th day of stay there were no towels changed and there was no cleaning, only a bed was bed and garbage was thrown away for two days, no air-conditioning, stuffy, I got a fan all rooted in dust, at breakfast sugar on the stool + coffee beans. . . Frozen pins all over the ground, the lady at the reception desk probably Ukrainian doesn't understand much what is being said to her. . ."
3027,"We have spent two wonderful weeks at the SIRENIS hotel we recommend to everyone this hotel and colla longe quiet area friendly to families not looking for club and disco madness on ibiza; ) If you are going to take an Ibiza madness it is not in this town, choose the capitals of EIVISEE THERE IS THE SCHOOLSHIP IS NOT LOOKING FOR NIGHTS AND NIGHTS OF EVENTS, but the colla longe is a quiet, peaceful and charming town, wonderful and the hotel met our expectations, first class food, animations for everyone something cool, friendly animators, friendly staff, courteous SIRENIS ZAUROCZYŁ we recommend warmly and sincerely ;)"
3028,"The hotel has forgotten that the walls are not everything. The service is bad, in a room of 25 degrees. The setting is not pro-client. Medium kitchen, the car park has to be parked on the lawn for 30 pln a day. Definitely not a standard 5 stars."
3029,"She bought this mixer about 3 years ago, betting on a Polish company, and just a week after the warranty ended, she broke down during dough mixing - official diagnosis - for dough. Somehow, the mother-in-law's zelmer mixer has been dealing with dense, yeast dough for 30 years and has always had a reserve of power. Repairing it cost me more than a new mixer, but the valuation itself, without repair, would have cost 50 PLN, so I had no choice but to pay. Yesterday, another crash and this time the mixer lands in the garbage. After finishing work - a light powder cake, so it is not possible for it to overheat - she put it aside without disconnecting from the power, shot once, in a few seconds the second, third, smoke, knocked out traffic jams and so much for our cooperation. Now I wonder whether to risk and buy the same, because I was left with accessories to zelmer, or look for something better. . . . . .but are they better? To the defect I will attach the still cracked at once plastic paddle covers, soft, soft gears in a rotating bowl, causing slippage, or jumping when rubbing the dough with pieces such as not yet grated fat etc. Generally for mixing water, or whisking proteins is quite strong, but for rubbing the dough, it's more solidified my aged grandmother had than this machine."
3032,"The hotel itself is ok. Clean, neat. The staff is very nice especially the bar and dining room staff. A place visited mainly by elderly Germans. No animation during the day, no music. In the evenings sometimes something happened but mediocrity. Animator should be mentioned necessarily ! Good food, drinks tasted good. Rooms are nice, bathrooms are modern. The fun was played by Poles at the disco polo: and it was a plus: ) Everything was rewarded by the beach; beautiful, clean, clear water, clear seashells. you could swim peacefully until 22h. Hot water. Just a fairy tale. I recommend a peaceful holiday. We will not go back there, we will choose a more entertaining hotel."
3033,"Anticarcinogenic phytochemicals are a very diversified group of tens of thousands of chemical compounds, responsible for the taste, colour and smell of fruit and vegetables. Some of them are so effective that they can be used directly in advanced cancer therapy. Others serve as a starting point for the production of substances even more effective in treatment. A very important group of phytochemicals are polyphenols. So far more than 10 thousand such compounds have been identified, but their protective role in plants has not been fully understood. The properties of plant foods and their prophylactic and therapeutic effects depend on their quantity and quality. Research shows that in the nutrition of modern man, however, they are as important as vitamins."
3036,"I believe that such a specialist, and most of all a man who is a triple-hearted in our health service, three months fought with a sciatic sciatica monstrous pain to a depressive state, After the MR examination went me privately to your doctor not arranged earlier there was no problem on Thursday consultation on Monday phone that I have to come to the hospital for the operation of the disk and eliminate the hernia, all took place very quickly and efficiently a wonderful man and a cozy incredibly modest once again thank you doctor : )"
3037,"Still the best results were achieved by hotels on the Warsaw, Tricity and Wrocław markets. Good operating and financial results are the result of sales and marketing strategy and cost structure optimization. We accelerated the process of divestment of non-hotel activities focusing our attention on the hotel industry and restructured our real estate portfolio by selling non-strategic hotels,"" says Laurent Picheral, President of Orbis SA, commenting on the results of 2011. It is worth noting that the results of the Company's hotels on the Warsaw, Tricity and Wrocław markets mentioned by the President of Orbis SA were also influenced by events related to the Polish Presidency in the EU, which were mostly held in the Company's hotels."
3038,"I've had this trimmer for 2 years. Earlier I had a Philips 7000 BT7085 / 15 which I unfortunately lost. If someone is looking for something to shave their beard I strongly recommend 7000 BT7085 / 15 instead of this invention. The main disadvantages of QG3371 / 16 in comparison to BT7085 / 15 is in my opinion : - A much weaker battery (as soon as the Reserve LED lights up, you have some 50 - 60s shaving) / / this is the most annoying drawback because a couple of times I didn't take the charger with me for a short weekend trip and as soon as the LED lights up, I knew I wasn't getting a beard trimming system - no hair suction system / / even though this system in the BT7085 / 15 leaves a lot to do zycznie, the difference is colossal; without a suction system you have to accept that after shaving you have to spend time cleaning the sink."
3040,"Everything's fine ! The service is very nice, no problem, the room is clean, daily visited by maids, to the bus stop you go literally a minute from where you can get to a very nice Rethymno! Unfortunately, in the village of Adelianos Kampos for young people nothing is happening, lots of restaurants, shops, shops, no parties: (The only downside of the hotel is not too warm food, which in addition is repeated every day, only lunch and one meal at dinner. In the bathroom at the reception desk, there was the same dead cockroach in the whole stay. In conclusion I recommend the hotel for less demanding!"
3043,"Hello I've had this chair for 4 months. Here are my observations . The first weeks were a nightmare chair smelled so smelly that it could not withstand the open window, smelled of rubber plastics and exceptionally lubricated mechanisms. After the first week the headrest fell off, it turned out that the latch is made of such a weak plastic and falls off by the action of the internal spring. The following weeks passed on complaining about the headrest fastening screws, which when fully supported crumpled into the back at the height of the blades, the problem was partially solved by replacing the screws with shorter ones. When replacing the screws, I found em that the threads into which they are screwed are so poor quality with one more unscrewing and they will not actually be there. After about two months, the backrest of the seat started to crackle when it was seated. After 4 months, the investigation showed that one of the pins in the mechanism worn out or was defective. For such a price I definitely do not recommend this armchair, it was supposed to last for a few years of use and after 4 months the mechanism of leaning disintegrates."
3044,"The hotel is long overdue. Four stars . . . . . .maybe it was. . . . . . .several years ago. . . The hotel is a remote location. Only a gas station near the hotel. . . The great advantage and advantage is the proximity of the beach; you walk under the tunnel about 50m. The beach is rocky and sandy. There are also rocks on the beach which you have to watch out for. The beach is uncleaned. There are cups and garbage. Bathrooms are deserted. The ceiling is lined with siding . The rooms are large and spacious. Restaurant and food is the nail of the program! ! ! Everywhere you go, a martadel in all possible views . . . Never in our lives have we met such a bad breakfast in any hotel. There have been days when bad breakfasts made up for lunch and dinner. Generally, the hotel was completely renovated. I wouldn't recommend it. I regret that we were there."
3046,"I have had an oven for a year now. Plus fast heating up and easy to use . On the minus side - loud work ! Annoying thermostat cycling . Quality of material - below criticism . After applying steam cleaning, described in the manual as Aqualytic, massacred discoloration appeared on the oven floor. In the place where the heater is located, the enamel has become dull. Of course Amica, without seeing the oven, denies responsibility. If you need an oven in which nothing will ever soil the surface, go ahead and buy it. If you are looking for an oven for everyday use - I advise against it!"
3049,"Accor will also continue its brand strategy in 2012, including Ibis rebranding and the development of the luxury segment, i.e. Pullman and Sofitel. Accor plans to double the number of Pullman hotels by 2012 (currently there are 60 hotels under the Pullman brand),"" said Denis Hennequin, President of Accor, during a conference call. Photo: One of Accor's Motel 6 hotels in the USA. Three quarters of Accor's revenue comes from the European market, but the network, which is growing rapidly all over the world, is striving to change this proportion."

I guess everyone who has dealt with him will confirm it. . . : ) A man is amazing just : ! When it comes to teaching... . ...hmm... . ...he can and does teach. I had an algebra with him and I advise him to pass the exam (in colloquia or with the help of the so-called . . . dopy) because he himself cannot solve the exam tasks.

3051,"For a long time she was looking for a suitable car seat for a very tall 2-year-old: ) earlier she used the car seat 9 - 18kg, this was supposed to be a bigger manufacturer gives 9 - 36kg - unfortunately, it is a little bit too much, although theoretically the child was in the middle weight range (16kg), this car seat turned out to be too small. With the headrest extended as much as possible, the child's head touched the upper edge of the seat, so I cannot imagine that the seat would serve for the next few years. Besides, the child car seat looked solid and I think it would be a great fit as the seat next to the carrier."
3052,"She was at the consultation at Mrs. Izabely's, she's very nice and friendly. For now I can only assess the visit, it was all on a professional level. The next opinion I will be able to write in a few m - c because I will have a course of treatment with your doctor. And we'll see how everything goes. And if the treatment course was well chosen."
3053,"I'm not happy with the purchase. First of all, they are extremely uncomfortable . They press my ears, after 10 minutes I am simply fed up and taking off the headphones is an incredible relief. Another issue is the communication problems at the beginning. In my case, after pairing the headphones with the phone, the first song jams. Maybe such a charm of wireless headphones, I do not know, I do not penetrate, for me it is a drawback. Disadvantage 3 is the same use of these headphones. These announcements about the volume can still be experienced somehow, but this signal, even if you turn off the device is extremely annoying. The sound quality is satisfactory, but these disadvantages. . I think that the headphones for 200PLN should be free of them. If I could go back in time, I would buy me other equipment."
3055,"I strongly do NOT recommend Mr. Moralewicz as a doctor because, not enough that she waited a very long time for the first visit that was cancelled for the beautiful weather and Mr. ""Doctor"" went on vacation to postpone my visit for a further date. At the time of the visit, it took about 1 or 5 minutes for Mr. M. He printed us a piece of paper with the text ""Recommendation to remove with laser"" (which also everyone knew about it and the son needs this and not a piece of paper from the printer) and told us to look for a doctor on the Internet. When he told me that what he had done (one and a half minutes' visit) was not worth a hundred zlotys, he took this printed card away from me but unfortunately the hundred was lost because his wife had already paid. After this visit I find that it is not worth to come there. Mr. Moralewicz did not show any knowledge for 1 or 5 minutes and the hundred we paid for nothing, I do not recommend it, he does not show any interest in the patient and the child continues to walk with sick legs. I strongly advise against it."
3056,"Despite waiting more than 5 hours in line for the Doctor, he didn't accept me. . . . . .I understand he had many patients and was tired, but in my opinion, not registering patients and having them sit for so many hours in front of the office is thoughtlessness. The plus is that he eventually invited me to a consultation at another time to his house. Despite everything, although I believe that Pand Janik is a very good specialist, unfortunately I will not go to him anymore."
3057,"In the course of a semester she asked with the preparation for the lab 4 times, usually she forgot about it, it scared her well to talk. The reports had to be corrected to the bull and as far as the deadline for their submission is concerned. . . . . .almost to the end of the session: ) credit - the current average of the reports is a bit odd (it depends on her humour)"
3060,"Smooth pass . At the end, it is enough to give the work on one of the topics he has given or on any other topic, any other, related to the lecture. Any form - paper, dissertation, story, dialogue, even a poem ; ] Volume of about a page, maximum two. Completed on time - 5 in the index . During the class, the presence is checked, but the checking is random - during the first class it reads all, later chosen ones . If he or she reads an absent person, he or she will read 100% in the next lesson . Thanks to this system, some of them did not manage to be 5-6 times without consequences: D From what I remember, there could be a maximum of 3 absences. As for the lecture itself - Mr. Kałuszyński speaks very quietly, calmly and slightly monotonously. Sometimes it happens that in the middle of a sentence he will take a break of about half a minute: D Generally, if you want to, you listen quite nicely, although the atmosphere is not conducive to concentration. In principle, you can do whatever you like during the lecture, as long as you do not talk loudly (he tear himself out at me for it during one of the lectures - he was shocked: shock :) . Most people read books, solve tasks or just learn. I recommend that you do this and listen to the lecture."
3061,"I don't recommend it. Why? As usual in Poznan, the ratio of room price to quality leaves much to be desired. And in Novotel Centrum this ratio is even tragic. The old hotel - everything is already used up to the limit. Smells, ore water in the tap, furniture to be replaced. A great hotel - like this type of facilities, it suffers from the quality of service. The people there are very unwelcome and do not want to help. Parking - some kind of mockery. A gigantic hotel with several places to cross. The only advantage is the location ."
3062,"During the visit, I met with the great kindness of a doctor. He could not make a final diagnosis due to the lack of a CD with test results. He gave his phone number asking me when I received the tests to present them for consultation in order to decide what further treatment to give."
3065,"I highly recommend the professor. I was without a child during the visit, which could have made the consultation difficult, because I only had all the documentation concerning the child's health condition (I note that the child was in another hospital at that time). She thoroughly familiarized herself with the results of the tests, evaluated and wrote indications for the doctor who was leading the child in the hospital. I must admit that the visit took place very late and I even wondered if the professor would still have time for me. Patiently, he listened carefully to what I had to say, then he gave me his recommendations. I highly recommend it, a great professional and at the same time a very nice man."
3067,"This is probably the best term for this person, the worst person, because as a doctor there shouldn't be anyone who doesn't have the attitude and sympathy for people, not to mention the patients, shouldn't be a doctor, a sick person needs not only medicines, treatments, hospital beds, needs a nice atmosphere, he needs to know about his illness, that's why the doctor should be a little nice, a little sympathetic to the patient, but he can't be as rude as this doctor, it's a life mistake of this lady, as far as the medical profession is concerned, it's a horror to patients! ! ! ! ! !"
3068,"Hotel for a family holiday. Dinner Christmas Eve complete failure - we regretted that we did not go to the restaurant a La carte . Breakfast and Dinner available at a price I think inedible. Coffee queues to the table - hotel not prepared for such a number of guests . The battle for places, families have to sit at 2 - 3 tables. Waiters walk so as not to see anything and often. You sit at dirty plates all evening. Restaurant a La carte "" Chapeau bass "" allows you to spend your stay with a reasonably sensible menu. Interesting wine list and waiter service. However, at the age of 6, it works perfectly well and you can turn a blind eye to certain things. A spa area worth recommending . Professional and inexpensive massages . Generally a successful stay ."
3071,"Maybe it's too early for such an assessment, because so far I was with him on his first visit to the OVUM and he seemed very competent and friendly to me. He explained everything to me, I hope that he made a good diagnosis and can help me with a good result. We will see. . . ."
3073,"Hotel very close to the salt mine. The hotel is located in the PKP station, which is an advantage if someone is moving around this center of transport. But it can also be a big obstacle during the stay. As clients who have purchased a 2-day stay through Travelist we have been located on the last floor in the last room closest to the station and track. The hotel made sure that we know when the next train arrives and departs; - ) . The food is good. Clean in the rooms. Large rooms. Hotel SPA at a good level. Large swimming pool, Jacuzzi, salt cave, saunas, possibility of buying treatments (quality of the air). Beware of the very slippery tiles in the pool. The water is made to fall and the water stands still. Moment of inattention and accident ready. Strongly knocked right hand - such a souvenir after a visit to the hotel. The staff should make sure that the floor is wiped off frequently and get rid of the water on the tiles. According to the regulations, you cannot move in swimming pool shoes. The overall impressions are positive. Small repair corrections indicated in particular on the walls in the pool part."
3080,"There are only 51 days left to the whistle that starts the first match of the Euro 2012 football tournament. Comparing the announcements made by the owners of the whole Poland, individual regions or cities, from the middle of 2007, with what was actually done, you can clearly see that most couples went to the whistle. Not a judge's whistle at all. So what do we have? We have stadiums, and even one too many, because considering the little needed, almost parallel creation of two arenas in Warsaw: Legia and Narodowy, it seems that one is redundant. Is it really, it will show the future. We have hotels and we have a great desire to earn money at the event. What do we not have? Certainly the leap of civilization that we expected. We do not have a network of motorways, and only a few new, poorly connected sections, we do not have modernized key sections of the railway network. We do not have a sufficient number of public toilets."

3083,"Hostel suitable for young people who like to party. Near the hostel there is an S platform - bahn and a little bit further the tram stop. The area is quite quiet. I was in a 4-person room with friends and I have no objections to this room. The public bathrooms are large, there are lots of showers, sinks and toilets."
3085,"She spent 5 days in Podkarpackie rooms, as for this price I can not accuse of anything - clean and tidy. In the TV room, a wireless kettle and two cups. The only thing to improve - emptying the trash can, should be more frequent. Plus a nice and helpful service. Generally nice and pleasant.)"
3086,"""The problem is the color of light. Blue and green light penetrates poorly into the tissues"" - admits Dr Borowiak . For the time being, the drugs could be used specifically to treat e.g. melanoma. One can also imagine that patients are introduced endoscopically thin fibers or implants are implanted to illuminate the tumor site, but researchers are looking for further solutions. ""We are looking for compounds that will change their structure under the influence of red and infrared light. Because light of such colours best penetrates tissues"" - assures the biologist. For now, the compounds developed by the researchers are tested in the laboratory on cell lines and mice. ""I think it may be 15-20 years before the drug goes on sale,"" says the PAP caller."
3088,"The guesthouse is located in the very centre of Polanica by the promenade. Next to it the owner provides parking space (free of charge). Downstairs, in the same building, there is an Italian restaurant, grocery store and bakery. Great location ! Very nice and clean guest house. The rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious, the furniture from Ikea, practically all new. LCD TVs. Clean and moody. On each floor a small kitchen, but well equipped with dishes, cutlery, pots, etc.. There is a fridge and freezer. You can heat up something (important for families with children) or even boil it. Exchange of towels on request and without problems. Very nice owner! The only drawback was the lack of soap on the sink. Generally a great place and I highly recommend !"
3089,"The lecture is even interesting. The evaluation is for the presence, but you have to be careful: he does not like talking and he happened to put a dot next to his name. If there is another one, you have an absence. But he doesn't mind if you don't think so, but you have to sit quietly and deal with a newspaper, etc. I recommend"

3092,"A wonderful midwife, she gave birth to my fourth baby with her, which was twisted with the umbilical cord. Everything went smoothly, she didn't let her know that there might be something wrong so I didn't panic. And even though she gave birth to me for the fourth time, she cared about me and kept me informed about what was going on, instructing me what to do and how to do it was invaluable for me. She was the first to protect my crotch, so she could sit me almost right after the birth. She also gave me a great opportunity to decide during childbirth. Thank you very much once again! I highly recommend Mrs. Susanna !"
3093,"The hotel deserves the highest rating! There are not many such places in Poland. Excellent quality to price ratio - a big applause for the manager - they manage both the hotel and the restaurant perfectly. : ) Beautifully selected and balanced in terms of volume! : ) Noteworthy is the location of the hotel with a beautifully developed, although small beach, but also beautiful terraces both near the lake and on the first floor; very nice development of the hotel and restaurant inside. The attention to detail is visible. The rooms are cozy, clean, equipped with air conditioning and very comfortable beds. Breakfast and other meals are prepared with the highest standards. You deserve a six! All meals are fresh, beautifully served and rich in choice. A great solution with a choice of omelets or scrambled eggs with any of the ingredients - prepared in the dining room. Bravo! My compliments are justified and I am a difficult and demanding customer. I would also like to point out that the whole staff of the facility deserves to be appreciated. It is also worth noting that the hotel parking is free of charge. I wish you every success and maintain this high level of service. I will certainly return to this place more than once. I RECOMMEND IT!"
3094,"It is difficult for me to judge a doctor after the first visit, the only thing I can write is that the doctor is sure to analyze the test results carefully, is patient and listens to the patient - which is certainly expected of every doctor. She had to sit a little longer in the waiting room, but I'm just glad she's a doctor who doesn't stick to time because I know she'll take time for me just like for others who need help."

3098,"As Dr. Pabiś explains, the ankle therapy should last for several months, except that each child will be treated differently. One child will need three months for it, another six months. According to the project assumptions, the therapy will be adjusted individually according to the age and sex of the child. Before starting the therapy, the cognitive processes, long and short term memory capacity, eyesight and hearing will be examined. ""The special diagnostic platform will be used to examine the activity of mirror neurons and check whether their population is large or small. On this basis the training will be modified and adjusted to each patient,"" explains the scientist.

3099,"He took advantage of this site to look for a good doctor to help me with my ailments that the doctors in my hometown are unable to deal with. I hoped that the positive opinions on this website were reliable but the reality was completely different and therefore I do not recommend this doctor to anyone, especially if you are a difficult case to treat. The professor was very casual, he didn't ask many questions and at the end of the visit he said that he doesn't really know how to help, because he would have to do various tests such as a CT scanner, the results of which I had with me as well as all the other documentation from my over 10 years of treatment! And that's the only reason I came to Warsaw to hear such words for 280 PLN (the price of the visit). He did not even make any effort to analyze my case - total disappointment!"
3101,"A professional in his field. She had problems with herself and her daughter, she gave birth to a doctor, a revelation - an expert in the full sense of the word. She is still our control doctor, because we have no problems at all, and I guess she wouldn't be able to replace her with another one. We greet Grazyna and Dorota"

3104,"My defect was small, Dr. Kapera said that in order to get the perfect teeth you need 2 years of treatment, he said that everything can be brought out nicely. I am after two years of treatment and I do not like the effect of the treatment today. He really thinks that everything is fine and that you can remove the braces. And I think it's worse than six months ago. To everything he has one and the same answer, ""It's not important and it's not obvious."" Paranoia! So where are those promises of his. After all, she chose me to take care of him precisely because I had to deal with what is now irrelevant to him and not obvious. The second time she didn't choose me to do it, it's a waste of time and money, words without a cover. She chose me because she has a very good reputation on the internet, it's a shame she suggested it to me. . . Maybe people with a big flaw are satisfied and see the results, but with a small flaw it absolutely did not work. If someone has a small flaw - do not choose them!"
3109,"I spent 2 nights there. A room of standard sizes, quite comfortable bed, while the decor leaves a lot to be desired; a communal wardrobe - closed with broken folding doors, a carpet not made with plinths or anything resembling them, ragged towels with a cue which is closer in appearance to the cloth. The room furnishings do not fit together, the furniture is chosen by chance - everything from another parish. I don't like the combined terrace and door opening system. Buffet breakfast is quite ok. The restaurant staff would rather expect this guest to greet you. The range is quickly completed, but there is a lack of courtesy and smile. I don't judge the spa because I wasn't. The hotel is old and needs a thorough overhaul. Receptionists are nice, but it's not enough."
3110,"I have it 2 months and I'm not satisfied. In the apartment of 70mkw there are problems with the signal, but it is to go after the appropriate setting of computers and the linkage. However, very often the connection to the Internet is broken, even though the computers are connected to the network, suddenly the connection to Int disappears. You have to log out of the network again and log in only then it starts working and no matter if you are using only radio network or cable, the problem occurs. It's just that the hardware is humorous and sometimes it doesn't want to be connected to the network at all, you have to e.g. turn off the power, but connect to the network several times."
3111,"I advise you not to have a cripple child. Unpleasant as a man and incompetent. In any case, the course of treatment is the same . To the ear of the trumpet and burying with a wire hook, finally antibiotic . Like 20 years ago . Only backward doctors do it . However, he is too much of a specialist, and even the tiny ones are screaming at children."
3113,"I have mixed feelings after the hotel visit. I'll start with the advantages: kitchen - the best food I've ever eaten in hotels, top-level massages, swimming pool - very pleasant with hot water, with a fireplace, an ideal place to relax. The saunas are also very pleasant. However, there were some serious downsides that made me not know if I will visit this place again - i.e. water with a taste and smell of rust, teeth need to be washed with mineral water, not to mention the comfort of bathing. Nice log bath, but unfortunately the water repelled the bath in it. The second minus is soundproofing. When someone above us in the room got up at night to the bathroom, the whole hotel heard it, the floor creaks and you can hear what the tenants talk about. Someone must have saved up when building the hotel, and it's a pity, because there could have been only advantages."
3115,"I went to see a plastic nose doctor about 3 years ago. The doctor is very nice, unfortunately, the effect of the surgery is so nice. Not taking into account the anatomy of the rest of my face, the surgeon has made my nose more protruding, which makes it seem bigger than before the surgery (especially in the pictures it is visible because it catches much more light than the rest of my face). There is also a much greater asymmetry in the view en face, the holes are crooked and are too small in relation to the tip of the nose and the tip of the nose itself is turned. There is also a larger hump in profile view than there was before. The only thing that went well was to level the bottom of the godforsaken part of the nose, the rest failed in my opinion."
3116,"The doctor has been treating my child for 4 years, since Marta was 4 days old. She is the best pediatrician she has ever met. She has already been going to see her with her friend's children (to control two of the three farted ones). She always examines thoroughly, asks questions, assesses the child's condition, does not use antibiotics and - if only she is - always takes even late. She will answer all the questions and doubts of the child's mother because it is normal and natural for her. She has never left her with a lack of satisfaction and the intention to revise the diagnosis with another doctor."
3119,"I consider my stay in the hotel to be very unsuccessful. Everywhere far away (20min. on foot), buses overcrowded so do not stop at stops (sometimes you have to wait an hour to stop). To the nearest Estepona 20 min . to Marbella 40 min . There are no attractions in the hotel area. There is nowhere to walk. The food is the same every day, not tasty, not very varied. Daily fries and cheese . For children very poor animation, daily the same songs, nothing more. Boredom. But the worst was the lifeguard at the pool (the lady in the hair and glasses mistake) who closed the pool at 16:30, folded deckchairs and taped the pool, although there were still a lot of people at the pool. Very arrogant and rude. In the pool there were women in burgers, socks and head scarves, and the lifeguard was asking the child who was wearing shorts and soaking her ankle-length legs out of the pool. The beach was rocky, very narrow. Without swimming shoes it was impossible to walk. After entering the water huge stones. The hotel is very old, decorated like from the Middle Ages, the view from the room to the roof with seagull droppings. The cables on the walls and plugged out sockets. The smell in the bathroom as if it poured out a cesspool. After entering the reception desk you can smell musty and old. Definitely not recommended."
3121,"After seven months he was promoted to the position of Executive Assistant Manager and was responsible for the entire operations department. After his experience in Edinburgh, he continued his career in London, at the famous Park Lane Hotel. According to the Bristol press release "" ( ... ) After his success there, he was appointed CEO of the Sheraton Tirana Hotel in Albania ( ? ! ! ) "" . Henning then served as CEO of the historic Westin Dublin Hotel. Under his supervision, the hotel achieved excellent results and twice, in 2009 and 2010, he won the Starwood Hotel of the Year competition and was also listed as one of the best places to work in Ireland. Andrew Henning has also gained international experience in the hospitality industry outside Starwood, in independent, mainly five-star hotels."
3122,"The hotel is well located and modernly furnished. However, you don't have to (as the predecessors might have suggested) have an IT education to understand how the hotel's facilities work, everything is intuitive. The style of the room, lobby, canteen - modernism mixed with vintage, seems to me perfectly hipster. Compact rooms, as a failed solution I consider only partial separation of the bathroom from the room by means of a glass wall. I suspect that it may be a nuisance when two people, not necessarily close to each other, occupy a room. . . Breakfast, price, amenities - hotel standard. y"
3124,"At first glance it looks neglected - it shows the state of the hotel name, placed on the reception desk (in addition, cheesily arranged with crystals). The rooms - in a tragic state. The showers are located in the room right next to the bed. do not be fooled by the photos on the website. the receptionist doesn't know what kind of guests will be staying at the hotel - reservations from hostel.com, booking.com and other websites - each in a different place, it took one hour before you found us on any of the guest lists. The hotel advertises its breakfasts - unfortunately, it hasn't been running them for a long time! The only plus is the windmills in the rooms."
3125,"Once a very decent hotel with a delicious breakfast. . . . .now the level has dropped significantly. The meals in the restaurant are terrible, and the cook is probably a maniacal fan of spinach, which is in most dishes. Breakfast, unfortunately, has been cut down considerably, and the taste of the dishes leaves much to be desired. Decent rooms. The only strong point is the reception staff; )"
3126,"For this price, he expected me to get more sophisticated equipment. The bowl is fixed in the robot in the opposite direction than the rod is spinning, so for heavier doughs it likes to be released when working. I have not worked out the same bowl rods (although they look very professional) leave on the bottom of the unmixed dough or cream (I will point out that I have other robot mixers that fall out better) However, the most annoying are the silicone mixers that should collect everything from the walls and the bottom of the bowl, which is very disturbing and actually prevents the masses from being raised on the * * * * * * * with simultaneous heating (to this end he bought em) unless you want scrambled eggs then they are almost perfect . As for the durability of the robot I can not say anything too briefly I have it. To sum up, personally he wouldn't buy me the robot again for such a price knowing about its defects. I was disappointed to write an opinion: ( : ( : ( and I am gently infiltrated, not to mention lighter by 3800 . There is always hope that somebody from Kenwood company will read my sweatshots and improve the defects in future models. That's how I know that hope is a mother. . . . ."
3127,"Mróz Marcin , M.Sc. Course: Physics 2 - Laboratory [ / b ] What's the big deal here - walking ideal . No entry, just a short question after the lab, which a high school student would be able to handle. He likes to joke around, helps with the labs. He rates very high, he never returns a reporter! Perfect!"
3128,"In addition, I have to include the location (ideal for transit accommodation) and breakfast. The service is very nice - at the reception the owner greeted us, and breakfast was served by his wife. One drawback is the lack of restaurant in the hotel itself, and even nearby. We had to go by car to eat something."
3130,"English B 1 rating : RECOMMENDED ! [ / b ] Exactly, the guy is really specific and student friendly: ) His sense of humour is invaluable and can surprise the student with many things. The classes are conducted in an interesting way. If someone knows German, they can talk to Mr. Bednarski in a different language : )"
3131,"Hello, ladies! Well, Dr. Bednarski got to me in November last year with a disturbing change in my chest. In my town, the doctor saw only one way out for me - surgery and cutting breasts. She was terrified of me. My daughter started looking for breast specialists on the Internet and she just found Dr. Bednarski. Bednarski . For the second day she decided to make an appointment for me. After coming to Silesia, the doctor did an ultrasound, said that this is a change that needs to be removed. He offered me a mammotomy biopsy, which is very little invasive and does not hurt the breasts, and after the surgery remains a small scratch. After this surgery you can go home immediately please believe me it takes less than 10 minutes and nothing hurts. I highly recommend Dr. Bednarski is not only an amazing professional but also a great man. I am very grateful to him for everything he has done for me. I believe with all my heart that God sent him to me. I greet the patient from Kutno."
3134,"Ophthalmologist Professor . Edward Wylęgała from the Regional Railway Hospital in Katowice pointed out that thanks to modern technologies doctors can restore vision to people once sentenced to blindness, including victims of accidents. This year prof . Hatch, together with his team, performed the first in Poland and the third in the world transplantation of corneal epithelial stem cells in a child. The patient was a 10-year-old Cuba, who four years ago burnt his left eye with extinguishing lime and lost his sight in it. Modern technologies, devices and materials also save the patients of the Regional Hospital of Trauma Surgery from disability. J . Daaba in Piekary Śląskie . As recalled by the director of the hospital, Professor Bogdan Koczy, in 2012 a modern operating theatre was opened in the bakery hospital, and in 2014 one of the most modern imaging diagnostics facilities in Poland. ""Without such a good base, orthopedics does not exist"" - he noted ."
3135,"Ladies and gentlemen , I am embarrassed and outraged by the quality of the room in this IMHO 1 * hotel. It's no longer even about the unfamiliar, fungal joints in the shower or the ruined furniture. However, how can you allow dirty towels to hang in the bathroom? The first one smells of the amount of bleach, the second one is gray of dirt that has not been removed? ! Service. . . for 40 minutes of waiting in the restaurant no one even came up to take the order. . . Terrible, I strongly advise against it. Never again."
3136,"I recommend - a very successful week's stay. A small place, but charming and well-kept. The charm of an old hangover, such a little vintage, glazed cure house in a beautiful park and dancing. . . Contact with nature and the possibility of excursions in the area / and there is something to explore / for motorists. The manor house itself, as described on the website . Nice service, spas with great treatments and competent staff, tasty food. There is internet, swimming pool. There are also some minor downsides - parking is a little bit nice when the hotel is fully occupied, the swimming pool is open with a break during the day, sauna from 16. When there are fewer guests, for those with a package, dinner is served to the table and there is no choice of dishes, which does not change the fact that the food is good and sometimes very good. The overall impression is favorable, a positive evaluation. It is certainly a place on the sidelines, which is not a disadvantage, and the advantage is that it offers the possibility of relaxation and tranquility. For me, it's a bomb."
3137,"Very good office organization and personal culture . However, despite my remarks about very weakness, fatigue and weakness, the Doctor stated that my results are in the laboratory standard (they were at the lower testosterone threshold and higher thyroid). However, as it later turned out, pharmacological intervention was necessary. So the visit was okay, but I lacked understanding of the patient and a broader perspective on my ailments."
3138,"The building itself is nice, but I don't recommend accommodation in ""Rybaczówka"". There is a room with a bathtub which cannot be fully used because the hot water ends, the boiler for 3 rooms in this facility for 12 people was not enough to fill the tub even in 1 / 3 of its volume. The room is a little cold, but they give an electric heater. In addition, the lack of carpets intensifies the feeling of cold. The hotel is prepared to accommodate children of all ages, there are all amenities except for the changing table, only the feeding chairs are for children over a year old. In the playroom every child will find something for themselves. The hotel is very pet friendly, the dog has a place to walk. The restaurant doesn't look like a delight, the food is good, but be careful: out of season in the week, when there are no guests, dinner instead of the buffet turns into a served card, to spend is 65 zloty, which with the prices on the card equals soup + second course, maybe enough for dessert."
3139,"The investor of this facility, as well as of the ""twin"" constructed at the airport in Gdansk, is the Port - Hotel company, which will also operate both facilities. The hotels are expected to receive their first guests in the second half of 2013, i.e. more or less at the same time as the one built for ""Renaissance"" airports. In the case of this facility Port Hotel is a franchisee and managing entity. The Port - Hotel company was established in October 1998 as Warsaw Airport Business Center, a year later it changed its name to Port - Hotel Sp . z o . o . It was established by Przedsiębiorstwo Państwowe Porty Lotnicze as a special-purpose vehicle for the construction of a hotel at the Lech Walesa Airport."
3140,"She's a great doctor! ! ! Thanks to her, I have two healthy children, for whom she has been unsuccessfully trying to get the Novum for many years. It is a pity that there are few doctors like her. She doesn't save on tests, she is extremely competent and it only takes one look at the results to know what is wrong with the patient. She doesn't look at the watch and in front of her she sees the man and not the next applicant. She was accidentally at the birth of my son and in a second she set everything up to make it work! Thank you doctor - grateful patient !"
3141,"Opinion on the basis of the European course [ lecture ] On the faculty: W - 12 WEMiF lecture not too boring, not too interesting. It is possible to endure these 2 hrs not something: D the final colloquium + a paper that raises the grade - hmmmmmm . . . .if I know: P good, okay. You like silence in lectures, I don't advise you to talk and disturb him. With credit for the problem, it wasn't, just a few people who didn't even want to go to court."
3143,"Dr. Dr. very nice, nice, but in my case / problems with the co-existence / , she treated only conservatively.large and frequent doses of testosterone and pills to improve the erection. After several years of treatment, which consisted of prescribing testosterone, I developed prostate cancer. Today I'm already after surgery to remove my prostate. Gentlemen, be careful with these treatments if you have a testosterone deficiency. Don't pack testosterone without some prostate tests and a dog."
3144,"A lot has changed in my life recently, especially my appearance, which I owe to Dr. Lątkowski's nose surgery. Mega positive! I hope that I will still have the opportunity to thank Dr. Łątkowski personally, but I know that such a form will also be fine: )"
3145,"Modern, clean, well-maintained closed housing estate. Tastefully decorated and fully equipped apartments. Great swimming pools, playground for children, exercise room - two treadmills and several other equipment, sauna. In fact, the parking lot is constantly full, we parked in front of the estate's gate. I do not recommend parking in prohibited places, because the security first sticker on the glass sticker, which is said to be hard to take off and then call the police. To the sea walk 10 minutes . Nearby a few places with home-made lunches, a little further on a grocery store. To the promenade on foot about half an hour."
3149,"The doctor was very kind and polite. He certainly has a lot of knowledge and is able to convey it in a simple way. However, the price of the visit is knocked off. 200 PLN for 15 minutes of conversation with a vase is an exaggeration . If there were any tests, I would be wondering, but the conversation and advice itself. . . Taking into account the fact that the drug in obesity treatment costs 450 - 500 PLN per month, plus a visit to your doctor every 4 weeks - all this makes obesity treatment in Poland is only for the rich. Unfortunately. . . The price of the drug is obviously not dependent on the doctor, but the price of the visit is already yes. Does the knowledge and practice abroad really justify the cost of consultation?"
3150,"Unfortunately, my opinion is negative. The doctor is not a professional in aesthetic medicine. She had botox injected by him into the so-called . . . lion wrinkle. After the procedure, there was no visible effect. I went for a consultation and the doctor assured me that botox will work, but it takes time, etc . . . After the next two months nothing has changed . When I went to another doctor, this time I actually had an aesthetic medicine specialist and I had botox injected, the effect was visible after about three days. Then a small addition of hyaluronic acid and wrinkles were gone. She paid m at Dr. . Mecca over 1 thousand zloty for injecting botox and now I do not know what to think about it . Was it botox at all? It was similar with his second procedure with hyaluronic acid which disappeared after . . . . . . . .month. . . ."
3151,"super location by the very market square, beautiful view from the window - on the tenement houses, well equipped kitchen. Unfortunately, these are the only advantages. Different address on the reservation, different in fact, and yet another address of the reception, from which you have to pick up and bring then yourself the keys of the mini rooms, in which the bed (or actually the mattress itself) occupies 2 / 3 place apartment with one bathroom for three rooms (for such a price the bathroom should be in the room) is noisy (even in the middle of the night) unpleasant smell after opening the window (restaurant downstairs) no service to extend the hotel day."
3153,"I made an initial reservation of the apartment with the possibility of cancellation. The hotel did pre-authorization of the card and then the authorization - the money was taken from the account. Reservations I canceled 1 . 08Hotel on my request wrote that immediately 1 . 08 made a return on my card . I waited until 11 . 08 - return missing on my emails hotels did not respond at all after two days . I asked for a confirmation of the return to be sent. Only after being scared of them by a lawyer did I get a monster - but they did not return until 11 . 08 For me, this is a thievery ."
3155,"Nice location, but with cleanliness is a problem. Dirty puff and lintels from the carpet. On the minus side the lack of additional TV channels (several did not work) . Air conditioning set to too low a temperature . It was simply cold at night. On the plus side - reception staff . Helpful, polite and interested. The manager apologized for the inconvenience and invited to dinner, promising to send a voucher. However, it turned out that she is a non-worded person. The hearing about this lady (who is supposedly responsible for the food as the manager) is missing and has not been heard from her so far. I'm going to write to the ocean marketing and inform who they employ in their hotel in Gdynia. You should not promise anything and then do nothing about it."
3157,"Rooms with a very low standard of equipment, very good food although monotonous breakfasts. Dictionary owners . At the first meeting one of the owners offered wine for hotel guests at 3 euros per bottle and at the settlement of the stay the second owner settled the ordered wine at 8 euros per bottle. The confrontation between the owners was not worth it, they pretended to be Greek and counted the wine at a higher price."
3159,"Course : History of Ancient Architecture I recommend [ / b ] evaluation based on presence, boring lecture but sometimes something interesting can be heard and lots of colorful pictures hehehehehe : P"
3160,"My predecessor talked about computer-aided engineering and I'll talk about Digital System Theory. You too are relaxed, no problems. The colloquia is 2 (maybe you can do 1), to get the credit you just need to write one positively. For the first circle I recommend to learn and spend some time on it. I think positively"
3161,"The Doctor's very nice and trying to listen to the patient. It was the first time I visited the Doctor and she wanted to add one, unfortunately the color of the composite was not well chosen, which meant that it was necessary to make a new appointment and corrections. Besides, the doctor is very nice and replaced the color of the composite with a lighter one - currently correct in relation to the color of the dentition."
3162,"We were at a visit to the National Health Fund at Hospital, we were treated like idiots, a family doctor who referred us to him as well. The doctor - a swindler saw in us potential clients of his private office and immediately started to make allusions that this and this would be best done privately, that it would cost a little bit, but this is the best solution, because Krysiewicz's hospital is a slaughterhouse and our child will suffer there. . . . we came out disgusted with his attitude to the patient, who definitely in the hierarchy of values of the doctor is far behind the money. . . . .we went to another doctor, who during a routine visit solved our problem, did a small procedure with local anesthesia during which our son did not shed a single tear. I do not recommend it!"
3163,"Mrs. Prusak made a very good impression on me. She was a little afraid of my visit, especially that it was my first visit to the gynecologist . The doctor collected a thorough interview, told about the examination, she was very delicate and relaxed me by introducing a nice and friendly atmosphere. She did a thorough examination, including taking a sample for cytology, the examination of the abnormalities did not show any signs of abnormalities, so we gave up - the equipment was of course. Suggesting my opinions and my health condition, she chose the anti-conception individually. I am very pleased and the visit to the gynecologist left no trauma but very positive memories. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
3164,"Good morning, the hotel is beautifully located, with a swimming pool and a terrace from which there is a beautiful view of the ocean. In the evening, the terrace is filled with performances by e.g. a folklore band and music. In combination with a glass of ""nikita"". . . .the flickering lights from the city center and the noise of the ocean. . . .and it's a great place to relax. As for the hotel itself, it looks the same as in the pictures. It is very tastefully renovated, a pleasant smell can be felt from the very entrance and in the hotel corridors. The food is tasty and much. In the morning the chefs prepare fresh omelets and cakes. Dinners are equally delicious - fish, seafood and crazy cakes: ) . 4x a day the hotel offers a bus to the centre of Funchal (stop next to the museum CR7). From here it is close to everywhere. Alternatively, you can take a walk around. 40 min . I was in Baia Azul with the children only 2 days. She was surrounded by a very nice atmosphere and care on the part of two Mr. Managers for which once again, thank you very much: ) Also for the fruit in the room: ) . Agnieszka , Angelika and Michał"
3168,"The doctor may be good at diagnostics, but he is very tactless and at times arrogant. She reported me to a private clinic, where she takes me to have an ultrasound to see if the finger ligaments after the injury are in place or not. The ultrasound was needed for my medical records and I just had to do it, it was not my idea. She paid me to pay 200PLN for the visit and after doing the examination she heard that I was a bit hysterical and panicked me doing the ultrasound because my finger was all right. It doesn't fit in your head to take so much money from someone for a visit and then still comment on it this way. And most importantly - she came to me to get a medical diagnosis and not psychoanalysis . . . . I'm not going to explain to anyone why I need an ultrasound, especially since I pay a lot of money for it."
3170,"Hotel really in a great location, first class views. The rooms are clean, spacious. First class swimming pool - did not see em swimming pool with better views . . . Very cultural service, maybe sometimes too much - for some it will be an advantage, for some an disadvantage. The atmosphere is a little too official for our taste and the information about the required outfit in front of the restaurant can cause confusion, because not every guest coming to the mountains with children takes with him or her the Smart Casual outfit. Of course, he did not have em shirt, or even polo, was not invited, but such information seems unnecessary - the exclusive style of the restaurant should be represented by the service, prices and level of service, and not by the dress of guests. This is the first minus, the second is the air conditioning - or rather its lack. We were in September at a temperature of about 24'C - the room was terribly stuffy because of the large window, which worked like a lens. It wasn't until the evening that it brought a cool down. I think that in a four-star hotel the air conditioning should be the standard, especially in this class of hotel."
3171,"Hello Long thought of 'em before buying a decent gun and decided on a STEINEL 3002 . The defeat on the whole line of the first attempt to work heats up, gave glue and stopped working. Shipping for service . After replacing the heating system, the gun released the glue sideways, dripped from the feeder and after five minutes it stopped working again. Shipping for Service . So far, I have had it for two months and it worked for 5 minutes. I think the gun for 100 should last longer. The cost of delivery for service and pickup is approaching the purchase price . I do not recommend this product. Forgot em service was surprised by the quality of the materials and the lack of seals (probably changed to a Romanian manufacturer) Steinel is no longer the same tools as before . I suggest that you think seriously before you buy . Greetings"
3172,"Dr. Sopylo is a nice man, he examines gently, listens patiently and explains a lot. Unfortunately, he prescribed me during feeding (about which he knew, because he asked himself) suppositories Proctosedon (Proctosone), where in the leaflet is directly said about the risk of inhibiting the growth of the child by hydrocortisol. This is a huge profession for me, because she trusted him and did not read the leaflet because he calmed down that they normally write to avoid taking during feeding. In the case of this medication, however, it was written above standard with an explanation as to why it should definitely be avoided. The medicine also affects the vaccinations my baby was given when I took the medicine, which penetrates into the milk, according to the leaflet and harms the baby. Be careful of nursing women."
3174,"Location of the hotel is very nice - surrounded by woods, near the hotel lift. The hotel itself is nice - but it is the only advantage of this hotel. . . The slope was completely unprepared. . . . A weekend trip. . . We were planning a short rest combined with a ski trip. During the first contact, we were informed on the phone that a wedding is taking place at the hotel on a weekend of our choice, so they changed the date, although we were not very happy with it, but if we are going to rest, we will not listen to music until the morning. . . We went on a different date. What was our surprise when the receptionist informed us that on the day of our arrival there is a company party. . . . . . . . .and she and nobody in the hotel knew about it. . . . . ( strange that the company booked itself a room in the hotel and a restaurant without informing the hotel staff in advance. . . . . ) Of course, the room they had reserved for us was no longer for us, we were given a room on the lower floor and until 4 in the morning we listened to this corporate event (I think the representatives of Coke - Coke?), and at this event it was happening. . . . . Total flock. . . . Apart from that, the temperature in the room resembled a truly tropical one, and unfortunately there were no air conditioning pilots. . . . (as the receptionist said - we should have got such a remote control together with a key, and if we didn't get one, it means there wasn't one. . . . . ) Finally, after my requests, the gentleman at the reception lent me his after midnight. . . . The hotel staff was not nice (only the waiters in the restaurant were nice, which is a great plus for them). Besides, there was a SPA bookmark on the site - but the site was under construction - and it turned out that this SPA is (or rather will be under construction . . . ) and not the site. . . . . To sum up, I do not recommend this hotel. On the plus side - the food (quality, although small portions) and Mr. Waiters, and the rest of the staff should be sent for serious training. . . . have a lot of catching up to do! ! ! !"
3175,"Apart from the beautiful courtyard, there's really nothing to see. She was expecting some chambers, rooms, etc. and she found out the most about the torture equipment. Yhm. Fascinating. I greet hotel guests in the prison wing, the cells converted into rooms must be very nice."
3176,"The hotel is nicely located practically by the beach at this end of the advantages. The building seems to be stuck in the eighties, although it is said to have been built later. Eating the tragedy of breakfast and dinner as such a catastrophic dinner was dumbfounded in a week's stay twice and that's about two too many for dinner after about 20 minutes ended up with a hot dish unless it was impossible to swallow. The rooms were poorly equipped with a TV set, maybe 10 inches missing chairs on the balcony, no words at all."
3177,"The standards of the rooms are very different, we have found ourselves with air conditioning, decent and clean. No less when booking it is worth to determine what you want from the standard. It is a pity that there are no fridges in the rooms. There are hair dryers, towels and water. The ladybird very close you can buy something if you need it, no less from the hotel has always expected a refrigerator to be able to hold the food or cool the drink :) The food is very tasty. Access to the wallnes zone, a small swimming pool, Jacuzzi 2 steam and dry saunas. Treatments . Mrs. Margaret cosmetologist - a wonderful woman with magic hands . Recommended with a clean heart ."
3179,"Hotel in the center and that's it. We have ordered a hotel for 2 days based on the photos placed on booking.com The company authorities arrived a day later.

Even the old Zelmer's meat razor, it still works and only the funnel cap for serving meat, you have to replace it with a new one because the plastic crumbles from old age. . . . ( 1985r )"
3183,"Original comment: "" Contact with the hotel is hopeless, no response to e-mail inquiries. The hotel provides an email address, after which there is no response to emails sent. It is better to book in competitive places. "" Extension: I had a similar case when I tried to cancel my reservation in October. I informed the reception of the hotel (before I planned to stay) about the death of a person close to me, asking for the cancellation of the reservation and reimbursement. The hotel refused, and for me it was not the time to enter into discussion with the hotel staff. The ratings are valid for both the above mentioned events as well as for the stays made in the previous year, from March to October, for a total of 6 reservations."
3184,"The hotel should not have hotel status 5 * ! ! ! It's our 3rd stay in Turkey and it's the first time we've met with something like that. The hotel is new, but it's always spoiled. . . . in the room air conditioning, which was repaired only after 3 echoes of days, and the worst was a leaking ceiling in the bathroom, when the tenants were taking a shower upstairs in our bathroom, water was pouring on the walls, after the light switch! (which threatened our safety), in such quantity that it flowed out onto the hallway. Of course, it was not possible to exchange the room for another, it was difficult to ask someone from the staff to clean the water from the floor. Often not working vending machines with cooling drinks. The restaurant had huge queues, no tables and inefficient air conditioning! ! ! ! Queues and quickly disappearing food in the snack bar. Too few deck chairs in relation to guests, no mattresses. The beach was ugly pebble and rocky, only the sunbathing terraces saved it. Generally dirty, deckchairs by the pool dirty in bird droppings! ! ! ! The terrace has not been cleaned since the opening of the Hotel! ! ! Price completely inadequate to the quality ! ! ! I don't recommend it to anyone! No solution to the problem by BP Ithaca, both during the stay and after ... ."
3185,"The first visit to Mrs. Dr. Kornet was not very successful, she was distracted and confused the threads she was drawing. First of all, she stated that she had been taking medication for more than 2 years and she had been taking it for me. I will add here that she gave up her therapy because she saw that it didn't bring any results and your psychologist just burned out in front of me. But then she said that she couldn't help me because she should find me another good psychologist and finished the visit. No concrete, not very concrete. Again, she stayed at the starting point and I do not feel like telling my story to another psychologist."
3186,"The service is not nice, even outraged with having to accept Poles. Breakfast is scarce, as for cattle, unsightly served, no variety, cold meals (cold steamers). The sausage is cut very ugly. Clogged sinks . Insects in bathrooms . Bedding very small and uncomfortable . If you want to buy a ticket or a beer in the hotel, buy it in the city, because they impose a high margin. In general, I do not recommend."
3187,"The doctor had as much time as she needed for me. It is not limited only to the problem that m reported, but also asked about other issues related to general health (in the gynaecological field). He reassures me, explains, commissions additional necessary examinations without exposing me to unnecessary costs."
3191,"The price does not correspond to the comfort offered by the hotel. Too poor communication - the connectors that divide the rooms such as the restaurant pool is a great tragedy. Hotel designed for families with very good topographic orientation. Dramaaaat . Dinners - too little choice of meat . As a rule, one type of fish and one type of meat - mostly chickens - truncheons or thighs . Logistics to "" sucks "" . I do not recommend for this price of course . - Be careful . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! A ."
3193,"If I hadn't needed something to eat sometimes and hadn't tried to use the restaurant, the rating would probably have been ""excellent"" - but unfortunately he tried 'em. Describing only the hotel - a sensational impression: rooms are small but exceptionally neat and climatic, clean, all new and fragrant. Bathroom without any problems (at least a bit of poor water pressure on the 3rd floor - maybe lower is better). clean and modern - there is a dryer and cosmetics, good towels. The room has an LCD TV and a lot of programs, good beds and good quality bedding, nice and comfortable furniture. In addition, an efficient network of wi-fi, lockable parking (for a small fee) and a good breakfast. Outstandingly nice owners and good and friendly service. However, there is a big minus - and this is the mentioned restaurant, I do not know if it even works for guests. The room is divided by a screen - and in this less accessible part some strange presentations of products, about 4-5 in the afternoon: no service ( ? ? ? ?? ), some lady sometimes comes out of the back room but rather for other purposes than service. Finally got 'em coffee but then gave 'em up - maybe later in the evening something changes? I don't know but around 5 in the afternoon - guests "" 0 "" - not counting the participants in the presentation of vacuum cleaners or other products, in the separated larger half. Generally for the night - deservedly the best place in Stargard Szczeciński - but something is not good with a restaurant."
3195,"During the first visit, the doctor quickly and efficiently made a diagnosis and prescribed drugs that helped. Because of the relapse there was another visit and extension of treatment. After the treatment, it will be clear whether the diagnosis was correct. Both visits lasted very shortly, because it took 10 minutes and even with a correctly made diagnosis the patient may feel that he has not been devoted enough time given the price of the visit and the information that it takes 15 minutes. For both visits the doctor was 10 minutes late and did not even apologize for waiting."
3196,"There are entrance fees for laboratories, but they are not very difficult - you can easily prepare for them using only the instructions to the laboratory. In addition, if you don't pass the pass, you still have to pass the lab, then you just have to go to the lab and pass the pass. For samples it sends only those who weren't, if someone wasn't, if someone was caught on the card, or if the exercise was not done properly (but you have to try very hard: wink :) . As for the final grade, it calculates the average of all reports and passes and usually pulls it up a bit. As far as the reports are concerned, they are generally given out in class, but if you don't manage to do it, you can finish them at home. In general, I liked the laboratories from the pp very much - they were stress-free and the grade was as fair as possible."
3197,"I just came back with the children from holidays in Primavera and we are delighted . Finally, I managed to find a center that meets our expectations. We lived in building A . The room was clean, tastefully decorated, comfortable, the bathroom was clean and functional. The food is great - a huge choice - of sausages, cheese, eggs, pastes, salads, muesli, yoghurts, various types of bread, tables are yielding. Breakfast, lunch and dinner is a buffet. Dinner was cool because there were a lot of cooked vegetables and salads with fresh vegetables, and to this always in addition to various meats there was something for the child, such as fish sticks or nuggets, and every day there were two soups, one of which always (which was great for us) is a broth. It was also very nice to be able to prepare pancakes by yourself. For me, the Playland and the pool area was brilliant. And the sea baptism on the beach was just great. My daughter didn't want to leave, she cried, said that this holiday was better than last year in Turkey."
3198,"The doctor in my place underestimated the disturbing symptoms that occurred after the operation and without additional examinations - he wrote home. After a few days at home, the symptoms intensified to such an extent that ... . thanks to the quick intervention of the rescue team from the ambulance, I did not land 'em in that world. The treatment lasted about 3 months, each doctor diagnosing my case - he emphasized that this could have been avoided - if only the doctor had ordered a simple examination and not discharged me home after the operation. . . . . Thank god and other doctors - that I'm alive"
3200,"THE MIDWIFE HAS HER WAY OF THINKING AND SAYS WHAT'S NEW IS WRONG. DURING THE BIRTHING SCHOOL CLASSES SHE CATEGORICALLY ADVISED AGAINST GIVING BIRTH WITH AN ANESTHESIA, ALTHOUGH SHE HAS NO IDEA ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT SHE UNCONSCIOUSLY SCARES FUTURE PARENTS BY INFLICTING INCREDIBLE PAIN ON THEM AT BIRTH.I JUST AFTER THE BIRTHING SCHOOL DECIDED TO GIVE BIRTH IN BIELSKO WITH AN ANESTHESIA.I AM HAPPY WITH MY CHOICE AND I CERTAINLY DO NOT REGRET IT. THE MIDWIFE SAYS THAT IN THE HOSPITAL THERE IS THE BEST CHILDBIRTH BECAUSE NATURAL."
3201,"The doctor has done a long, detailed interview with me. After a few visits I saw that she was not sure about her diagnosis, but she decided that I have a very serious disease and prescribed expensive medicines (claiming that they are not harmful in any way and can only help). I was a little bit broken and at the same time I was surprised because only two of the results of the multitude tests came out wrong. I decided to consult another doctor just in case (one of the best I could find in Warsaw). The doctor stated definitely no disease and even issued me with a certificate (he said that the only two bad results are also in healthy people). He also asked if I had been to see an ophthalmologist before taking this medicine because it could damage my eyesight. To sum up, Dr. Heather gave me a bad diagnosis that caused me a lot of stress and I wasted a lot of money not to mention the health I could have lost by telling myself that I was sick and taking the medicine with a serious side effect. I do not say that I do not recommend visiting Dr. Heather, but I strongly advise you to consider her words and in case of a bad diagnosis verify it."
3202,"Prof . Stępniewska reminded that the discovery of ectoine is the result of research conducted in Bogdanka coal mine. First the scientists wanted to find out why there is no high risk of methane explosion in Bogdanka, as it is in mines in Silesia. It turned out that in the coal rocks in Bogdanka live bacteria - methanotrophs - which ""feed on"" methane. ""They are such invisible allies of the miners of our mine,"" she noted. Then it was analyzed how these bacteria live and function in such difficult conditions, more than a kilometer below ground, with low humidity, increased salt concentration in the environment. ""They discovered that they are protected by ectoine. They saw that we have a unique, one and only material,"" said Stępniewska."
3203,"In addition, in the coming years it will still be possible to undergo screening colonoscopy without an invitation (the so-called opportunistic system). Prof . The rule stated that persons with such symptoms should be subject to diagnostic tests (including colonoscopy) but financed by the NFZ and not under the prevention programme financed by the Ministry of Health. Information on centres to which it is possible to apply for screening colonoscopy can be found on the website of the Screening Programme ( http://pbp.org.pl ) ."

3206,"A very successful holiday at the Hotel Montecarlo ! I sincerely recommend . Everything exactly as in the pictures . As written, the hotel was being renovated, as you can see. Everything is new and clean. We had a room on the 2nd floor with a view of the sea. There are also rooms overlooking the pool. In the evening there are parties with live music by the pool, I expect it can be a nuisance for those who have rooms on that side. We have not heard anything from you. Large balcony, new balcony furniture, towel dryer. Air conditioning in the room without any problems. Programs on TV mainly German and English. But I'm not going on holiday to watch TV. To the beach 5 minutes walk, a charming street among the palm trees. The beach is sandy, wide, clean. You can use the sun loungers on the beach (10, 50 euros per set/day) or lay out towels directly on the sand. The water is clear. Along the beach is a long promenade with shops and restaurants. You can not get bored. The food in the hotel is delicious. Every day different cuisine . Mrs. Anna , Tui resident nice and helpful. We did not use the pool, but there were a lot of deck chairs."
3207,"I will start with the fact that I do not understand the delight of patients because of the ""high personal culture"" of this doctor, for me it is obvious that the doctor should behave culturally towards the patient, but to the point: I am after the first visit, the doctor informed me very thoroughly about the mechanism of my illness and the therapies applied to it, a neurological examination carried out also very accurate. I am glad that he has offered me a therapy that no other neurologist has offered me, a new light of hope has shone, if time will rightly show. The downside of this doctor is that he doesn't really listen to the patient and that among the prescribed drugs he has been prescribing me an emergency pain reliever for a year, which has been withdrawn from the market for a year, and the other one, which is a public over-the-counter remedy too weak for my pains."
3208,"""Our method is to detect the presence of pathogens in the blood of a patient with suspected sepsis within a few hours. Thanks to this, the doctor will be able to take fast, proper antibiotic therapy to immediately apply the right, effective drug to the patient and not to do it blindly"" - explains one of the creators of the method, Tomasz Dr. Gosiewski from the Department of Microbiology at the Jagiellonian University Medical College. As the doctor explains, who wants to be sure that the medicine he prescribes is effective, he must have a hint from a microbiologist what is sitting in such blood. ""The method we have developed can give such a hint faster: up to six hours maximum"" - explains Dr. Gosiewski ."
3210,"Hello, we have rested at the Holiday Resort & Spa Hotel for the fifth time and we will probably come back again. There is charm, wonderful atmosphere, beautiful views. We have already been in many hotels in Turkey, but only to this we come back with great sentiment. Delicious, varied food, every day different dishes are served. The rooms are spacious, daily cleaned. The hotel is located in the middle of beautiful greenery, on a hill which allows you to enjoy wonderful views - morning coffee on the terrace of the restaurant reads pleasure. The atmosphere of the hotel is created by people: nice waiters, wonderful, professional and engaged in their work animators, who even very sluggish can encourage you to have fun: Christina, Eddie, Samir, Mutti thank you for the time spent in your company. See you next year : - ) : - ) : - ) We highly recommend a holiday at the Bodrum Holiday Resort & Spa. Peter and Asia ( Mam and Papa : - ) )"
3211,"I had the pleasure of visiting this hotel a few days ago. A very quiet place. Nice and professional service. Drink bar very cool . You can count on advice on how to serve drinks . A bartender who knows his job very well. . . I have only minor reservations about service in the hotel restaurant . As for 4 stars, I don't think she's exactly trained. The staff (even though she is very nice) are not interested in whether everything is all right after serving the meal. Whether the dishes taste good or not and no bread is served. But despite these drawbacks I remember my stay very well."
3212,"I'll say so the views are great, the possibilities are huge, medium purity, but the prices giant man practically for everything pays 4 times more in the area is a shop but the prices in it is an exaggeration for a roll you have to pay 4 martens for butter I paid 28 kuna is a laugh in the hall. And that's what they want money for every step and they cheat. We left in groups we got bands with which there were supposed to be discounts, which of course were not at one party, beer cost 10 kuna but at the second 15 we do not know how it was at 3 because there was no power and it was called off. I do not recommend this center yet at the end the cleaning lady came to pick up the room by my side called me at the reception desk and told me that it's okay and to bring the keys to the reception desk and there is a penalty for a broken glass and an inexperienced cooker 150 kuna waiting for me! no way because of that day we were already leaving, we didn't have any munitions, we had to pay more than 94 zloty from the account, people avoid the wide gap, don't be fooled by the lower price of the trip, you pay several times."
3213,"My husband and I will recommend you to the Doctor. We have been given a visit after our first pregnancy, which died. The doctor ordered a number of tests, then implemented treatment, monitored the results. All this was done in order to get pregnant again in due time and most of all to keep her pregnant. ""They surprised us"" at once. The pregnancy itself was complicated, fortunately thanks to visits, prescribed medicines and the Doctor's care we are the parents of a 3-month-old son (healthy and born on time). The Doctor is able to bring him down to earth and calm down when he reads too much stupid stuff on the Internet and then finds the same symptoms. He can also react quickly when something happens (and here I am most grateful for the private telephone number she could call every day at any time - the Doctor answers all calls). Of course I also sometimes had to sit in the waiting room. However, she entered the queue 3 times and she didn't speak to me due to complications, that's why I know that some things will not happen. Especially in medicine . Once again I highly recommend!"
3214,"Mr. Dr. Dr. made a very good impression on my daughter, but I was surprised that he didn't examine me (he believed on word of mouth that I had no neurological symptoms), he only watched the MRI, the diagnosis he made was correct, but he didn't write down any information, so the next time he visited me she would have to tell me everything from the beginning. He gave a referral to himself for a blockade. She paid m 250 PLN for this visit because she has the opinion of a very talented operator and probably it is so, but he has not operated on me yet, although he expressed such readiness. All in all, nice and factual ."
3215,"The explanation requires that an apartment for 6 people actually means 2 bedrooms and a living room with a couch. So there are 2 beds and a couch available. Both the apartments themselves and their equipment are worn out and need to be renovated. From the windows you have a view not of the street but of the inner courtyard, which also does not encourage. You have to wrestle with a key, it took on average 5 minutes to open the door. Of course the noise, but this is the city centre and I took it into account when I ordered. The staff confused the rooms and moved us to another apartment, where, to my surprise, after a walk in the city, it meant that they simply entered the premises we occupy during our absence. By the way, there was no hot water in the last few days."
3216,"We've only been at the Skansen Hotel for one day. Indeed, the architecture of the building is impressive. Three buildings; Water, Fire and Sacrum. Each with similar dimensions, but with a different finish on the outside. Wonderful lobby, amazing concert hall, nice swimming pools, outdoor jacuzzi. A lot of space outside, surrounded by forest. Besides, a slight disappointment. Superior room with mezzanine furnished with furniture and textiles from Ikea. Combined with the architecture of the entire building, it is tacky. Breakfast is another unpleasant impression. After entering the room, we found a battlefield: leftovers of food on the floor, broken cups, wet around the coffee machine, unpleasant view. No wonder, there was only one person working in the room. We had the impression that the hotel management was failing all over the line. Or maybe it was the lack of training of the staff? While checking out and thanking for the hospitality, the receptionist talked to her friends instead of saying goodbye to the guests with a smile. It is so normal ! To all those who hesitate, despite these shortcomings I recommend."
3217,"Stimulator implantation operations consist in opening the spinal canal and then inserting an electrode over the spinal cord hard tyre. To this electrode current flows from the stimulator, which is placed on the patient's trunk. The current from the stimulator through the electrode is to effectively irritate the brainstem structure. The stimulator is connected to the electrode with a wire running under the skin. Every 15 minutes the stimulator sends a ""dose of current"" to the brain. Prof. Maksymowicz earlier explained to PAP that it is supposed to increase brain flow so that there is more nourishing blood, ""so that those neurons that survived injuries, feel better, are better nourished. The increase in brain flow and brain stimulation is consequently supposed to lead to contact with people who were previously in a state of minimal consciousness."
3218,"Thank you very much, Isabella, for your time! During the therapy she helped me to cope with the difficult situation in which em found themselves, at the same time opening up to myself and making me aware of suppressed emotions. Many things have taken on a different dimension and I hope that I will be able to keep the peace of mind. I recommend meetings with Isabella to anyone who not only has problems but also when they do not find answers to the questions they ask themselves. I recommend it to those who do not expect advice and ready-made solutions but are ready to take time first of all to themselves and face their fears."
3219,"hello a very specific doctor , you can see that he knows the treatment and not the stretching I am a beginner patient so I can not say too much about it, but after visits to other doctors who make you feel that only expensive treatments that not everyone can afford and of course hundreds of tests done by doctors and places that they will point out will give some results Mr. Doctor as the plague denies all this we will see what will happen next I recommend."
3220,"I've been looking for a phone for a long time to fit in the amount and find something reasonable. It seemed to me that he found em an ideal for himself. Visually, it's a good fit, snug fit, squeak-free housing, good performance. It worked very nicely for me, it didn't scream for my requirements - a needle. Maybe too quiet speaker but it wasn't a big flaw for me. I had a touch on the screen and it turned out that I would either choose half the value of the phone for repair or I would say goodbye to the phone. The manufacturer wrote that the warranty on the screens is 6 months and there are no strong ones. I am very disappointed and think that the phone is heavily overrated. From now on I will also read the warranty terms carefully. If the manufacturer gives such a low warranty then it should stink and as you have convinced yourself, you already know why ."
3221,"Very weak doctor - definitely not recommended. I was at your doctor's for a consultation with my less than three weeks old daughter. You were actually of course of course of course of course that I came to her. There is no approach to the child at all, which is surprising for such a specialization. She was feeding the little one, and she didn't tell at all what is the result of her rather disturbing, for me as a young mother, observations. She directed the child to the service completely without explaining why or why. She was so anxious that the next day she went to the neurologist recommended by the paediatrician. The difference was incredible! Under no circumstances should I recommend it."
3222,"Inorganic chemistry I , lecture by Prof . Walkowiak is a really nice man . The lectures are clear, and if someone will not go to them anyway, he can easily use only the script (which is, after all, his own). Learning from the script is enough to prepare for the exam. You can learn a lot in a good atmosphere. . . I recommend"
3223,Not the best hotel in the area - rooms poorly equipped and quite noisy until late at night. Going to bed before 23 : 00 is rather impossible. The buffet is fine and the pool and beach are bearable. That's as much as I have to say about this place except that I'd rather not go back there.
3225,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! Battery under warranty ( it is just over six months old ) . The car has been parked for a week in the parking lot. After a week the car did not start any more, even the central one did not work. The battery brought home to recharge (at that time the voltage was 7, 34 V). Immediately after recharging, it had a voltage of 11, 88 V (when connected in the car there was no reaction, the central nothing, the lights were not lit - a gloomy return home from the noise in the paw). The next day, the voltage was already 10, 83 volts (he was standing at home all the time). The next day and another attempt at charging: during charging, the voltage reached 11, 89V, after charging, it dropped to 10, 68V. Finally, the grandfather went to complain. Of course, the complaint was not taken into account, because there was no manufacturing defect. But why does he discharge himself all the time when he is in good working order?"
3226,"If someone is planning on sleeping in this city before the morning flight from Wrocław, I recommend it. hotel 1 * . We paid 59 zloty for an overnight stay for two people . and the prices according to the information in the room from 39. parking lot for 19, you can pay by card . the room had us on the 1st floor . there is an elevator . The hotel has 3 floors. our room is 150. microscopic. a small room with a washbasin of soap, a shower cubicle, towels, separate toilet. a small TV set, over 20 programs. Towels, cosmetic set and breakfast can be purchased. bed quite hard but . . . . .for this price you don't get offended, clean and all that was necessary. . . .if I needed and the price will be good I will certainly use because the airport is very close and the price is fine."
3227,"I recommend that after one month of use, your husband has confirmed the positive effects of the drug. He prolongs the treatment in order to stabilize the state of health . However, I start the treatment. Dosing of the drug causes problems due to high density of the preparation. Our patent is to drink the contents of the vial (after previous shaking) and then pour water into the vial, mix, drink and repeat the operation. Without washing the vial you will lose about 1 / 5 of its content. The most important thing is that the medicine works. ARTIVIT was recommended by a friend who had previously used the preparation himself."
3228,"Absolutely fantastic place, nice staff, design thoughtful in every detail, folk motifs given in the most beautiful edition! Very comfortable rooms and something I like very much - a bathtub in the bathroom (there is nothing more pleasant after a mountain hike than a bath in fragrant foam. . . . ) All those who plan to run such facilities should take an example from here! The most delicious breakfast that she has eaten is fresh, apart from a very large selection from the Swedish table, additionally custom-made hot dishes, all beautifully served. On Saturday, additionally Prosecco to breakfast ( !) on Sunday waffles with fruit. . . . . . you understand, I wanted to stay there forever! For now, I'll definitely go back there and recommend it to everyone!"
3229,"There are several methods of reducing radon concentration. The basic method is to ensure adequate ventilation and airing of buildings, especially cellars, where this gas accumulates most. Other methods include control of building materials, proper selection of land for house construction, sealing of cracks in foundations and places of connection of installations to buildings, use of protective films. In Poland, a draft of regulations concerning the implementation of the EU Directive has already been prepared. They propose, among others, mandatory radon measurements in workplaces . ""We must raise people's awareness so that they know what the effects of natural radiation can be. It is necessary to establish the so-called radon plan for Poland. It is necessary to recognize the situation we have, collect archival data and perform screening measurements as well as information campaign in the communes, including training for construction companies and developers, so that people will know this problem"" - said dr hab . Cossack. ( PAP )"
3230,"""Atrial Fibrillation, which is the most common arrhythmia in adults, occurs when the atria do not contract. The heart starts beating immeasurably, there is a heart rate deficit on the perimeter, which means that the pulse wave on the radial artery does not coincide with the heart rate"" - explains a scientist from the WUM. He estimates that atrial fibrillation is found in 5 - 10% of elderly people, and in Poland about 400 thousand people suffer from this disease. Patients with fibrillation complain about palpitations, weakness, limited ability to perform physical efforts. They may faint or develop coronary pain. Atrial fibrillation is recognized by ECG. In cases where it is rare and short, a long-term ECG is needed, e.g. Holter ECG. Prof . Gaciong points out that it is important to find the cause of this condition, e.g. undetected heart defect. For this purpose, additional tests are performed to assess the condition of the heart and lungs, i.e.: blood pressure measurement, ECHO heart, chest X-ray and blood analysis."
3231,"I like this hotel, and that's why I'm sorry when it loses quality. She would like it to always be like it used to be, that is: a well-functioning and clean restaurant with perfectly trained staff. Comfortable, clean rooms, each with a beautiful view of Jaworzyna, beautiful SPA and good cosmetic institute. Meanwhile: Jaworzyna stands in its place and looks beautiful from the windows, the cosmetic institute has developed very much and does not give way to French or Swiss tabernacles of this type, but the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired and it hurts a little bit. Here the time seems to have stopped. The floor is dirty, the furniture is barely alive, the overall arrangement has long since failed to match the quality of the hotel. The dishes are tired and weird (elegantly it shouldn't mean strangely!). I admit that the staff does what they can to make guests not notice it, but unfortunately. They would mention my management in the kitchen. Oh, and one more thing: don't go in there to the elevator! But I still like this hotel."
3232,"The accommodation conditions in this ""resort"" are terrible, without renovation for 40 years, the door to the room is so thin and with cracks so you can hear everything, in addition, the noise is carried in the corridors where the tiles are placed, food - brought from another resort, summer, and little unfortunately, you can not take a step back, the climate as in the colonies in the 80s, with vegetables such as a piece of salad 3x3 cm: ) The portions are separated - just like the place at the tables, everyone is sitting next to each other - strangers, the atmosphere is poor, nobody is talking to each other, the strange stay was like in some camp. Lying on a high heat and away from any store or attraction, without a car or a move. The rooms are cramped, no radio, kettle, TV. The only advantage is the nice view from the window on the hill: ) but it wouldn't be enough to be satisfied with the stay. The staff is only normal, the rest of the staff members should be thoroughly trained in how to serve the guests, because they lose them by growling on the customers, so they save themselves with groupings and coupons etc. The rooms were not cleaned during the whole stay, only garbage bags were hung on the handles to change and paper was also hung on this handle: ) generally the stay was full of water, the toilets were terrible, on the first day there was someone's empty shampoo bottle in the shower, - so I don't want to know what it looks like to clean the rooms after guests."
3233,"We've been to this hotel twice. The first stay in 2011 was great in every way and that is why we came to this hotel again in 2014. This year's vacation unfortunately left some sad memories. The food was tragic, it is hard to tell because something like that has never happened to us before. The food in the city was great, cheap and good. In the hotel cold, disgusting taste and in addition, what was for example from breakfast was added in various forms to dinner. The second week is a serious stomach problem in my case. I recommend the hotel but I strongly advise against eating until the pseudo-manager of the restaurant changes."
3234,"He pointed out that in the case of people with skin phototype I, i.e. very light complexion, blue eyes, blond or red hair, regular exposure to the sun is not recommended due to the risk of developing malignant skin cancer (especially melanoma). Moreover, in the majority of Poles, even during the sunny months, the production of vitamin D in the skin is not sufficient. ""Our life looks like we move around in cars everywhere. We get up in the morning, take the children to school, spend eight hours there, come by car to pick them up, take them to extra-curricular activities, and it all takes place indoors. That is why children and adults are also exposed to vitamin D deficits,"" said Dr Płudowski ."
3235,"Honestly, I can't say much about the Doctor. . the visit lasted 5 minutes, she had a little bit more expectations of Mrs. Annie, a quick diagnosis of the ''disease'' prescription and going home is not enough. . Despite my questioning, I had the impression that what she had to say was already said and it should satisfy me."
3236,"Our stay in the hotel I have a very nice memory. High level of service, quickly responded to minor inconveniences. The hotel is child-friendly. Very professional SPA area with a large swimming pool and a nice paddling pool for children. In the hotel itself many attractions (bowling, billiards, the possibility of renting bikes and exploring the nearby area). Only a small minus compared to breakfasts, which lacked fruit and vegetables and poorly heated dishes. Besides, the area, the staff and some other ""details"" made us forget about the hustle and bustle of the city. I highly recommend it especially to the townspeople who are looking for a break from everyday life."
3237,"""I am an industrial worker, not a scientist, but I have more than 30 years of experience in conducting research related to the use of lasers in the industry, their control systems and the design of medical equipment. I can therefore contribute practical knowledge to the education of future professionals. The relationship between a more experienced person and a younger student is well known. The mentoring programme should involve people who are appreciated at the university and who have contributed to the history and reputation of the university,"" said the engineer. Orkiszewski emphasizes that in Silicon Valley, where he lives and works, all his colleagues know where he comes from and which university he graduated from. ""The education that he has received from me has allowed me to develop my skills comprehensively. I owe it to the people he met in the process of his education. He graduated in precision mechanics, now it is the Faculty of Mechatronics. He studied biomedical engineering, my professor was Grzegorz Pawlicki, President of the Association of Warsaw University of Technology Alumni and Friends. My second mentor is Professor Tadeusz Pałko. They and the program created by them gave me a broad basis for further development"" - he recalls ."
3238,"You enter a hotel and you think to yourself: Wow! My husband was impressed by this hotel once and he wanted us to sleep there during his next stay in Warsaw. This hotel impressed me too, but only at the beginning. The spaces, the view from the window on Warsaw, were captivating! ! ! Then I wanted to leave it as soon as possible. She was tired of this stay and disgusted. Twice we had to change rooms. Once, because the reception desk was mistaken because it gave us the wrong room, and two when it turned out that already in the right room, only cold air was coming out of the air supply, so it was cold! ! And all in all, I wouldn't have any pretensions about anything because the mistake and error is not strange to me, but the way we were treated by the reception at the second room change is not possible to ignore it in silence. A long story. He will only write conclusions. Two receptionists on the phone were very rude, I won't even call it a lack of professionalism but even a lack of human tact. They also forgot to write in the system that we were moved to another room, which caused problems with the maids, we also had a few visits to the room! The manager of the rooms tried to alleviate the situation and apologized for the reception, said that they should compensate us for such unpleasantness and is convinced that the hotel manager will do something about it. On the day of our departure, we checked out and didn't even hear our apologies. She wants to emphasize here that it is not about these mistakes but about the whole setting that has come about and the attitude of the staff to their mistakes. We lost three hours on all this. It's a really long story. Tragedy! ! ! Too bad! We didn't even go to the spa for all that. Everything that seemed pretty at first, lost its shine."
3239,"Course - elements f - electrons - boring but simple to pass, the grades are subject to discussion, the presence raises the grade, Dr. very nice with a sense of humor."
3240,"Hotel very intimate, small but quite cozy. The food is tasty, but monotonous, every day the same with small modifications, very shortly spent. Rooms are fine, neat and clean. The air-conditioning also works, although you can hear it much, in the morning waking up we had the impression that it was raining outside the window, such sounds seemed. The downside was that the English service was very poor to me, because you couldn't talk to them, which seemed alienated. The location close to the beach, although there were literally a dozen or so deckchairs belonging to the hotel, which did not satisfy the needs of guests. Sometimes, to lie on the beach, you had to use the sun loungers paid for by the restaurant next door, because the hotel was all busy. The swimming pool at the hotel was tiny, so as to cool down while sunbathing, nothing more. To the centre of Marmaris 15 minutes on your feet or 5 minutes in the bush. For those who do not require lux and appreciate peace and quiet. For a little money, you can go ahead."
3241,"On the plus side: + spacious rooms, attention to detail, + good location to the market 10 minutes on foot, + comfortable beds, + small but clean bathroom, + quite good breakfast, On the minus: - necessity to leave the magnetic key to the room at the reception, - no parking, it is difficult to stop close to the hotel to unpack the suitcases, - the staff at breakfast could not cope, the cramped breakfast room, - the decor of the hotel and the room is a thing of taste of course, if you want to feel like in grandma's apartment then the hotel is for you, - as for the standard too high price (about 300zł for a room 1os and 400 for 2os)"
3242,"No more of this hotel. It's dirty in the rooms as well as in the whole building. The food is the leftovers from the meals lacking in variety and, what is worse, the appropriate amount and hygiene. The package was bought by a popular website with tourist offers. Small and dirty swimming pool . definitely not recommended"
3243,"I am not satisfied with the visits to your doctor, he did not solve my problem with abdominal pain, flatulence and general gastric problem. After a private colonoscopy at the hospital where I had to wait in line anyway, the doctor stated that I had to do the surgery again because nothing was detected. . ."
3244,"Although substances similar to LifeGel are developed in various places around the world, this solution developed by Poles is better in several respects. ""It is a solution that gives a clean and repeatable product. Our goal is to enable research to be carried out widely using three-dimensional cultures"" - adds the biotechnologist. Start - up Real Research from the Jagiellonian Centre of Innovation, apart from Marcin Krzykawski, is created by Renata Szczelina . Both of them are graduates of the Faculty of Biotechnology of the Jagiellonian University in Cracow . Marcin Krzykawski is currently completing his doctorate in the Department of Immunology at the Jagiellonian University Medical College. Their adventure with the development of hydrogel began a few years ago, when they joined the team whose task was to develop three-dimensional bioprint - a technology that would make it possible to print structures containing cells."
3245,"I was very lucky because I managed to get to doctor Marcin Kosiński in due time, who helped me a lot in the treatment of my prostate, which I have been suffering from for 20 years (I am now 83). Recently the ailments have intensified to such an extent that in practice they have prevented me from living a normal life. Hope for them has just been restored to me by Dr. Kosiński. The whole period of waiting for admission to the hospital took care of me, professionally and patiently performing the necessary examinations and treatments, including periodic catheterization. The operation was performed by Dr. Kosiński very professionally, stress-free, painless and without complications, for which I am extremely grateful. To all those who suffer from urological ailments I wish that, like me, they would have a chance to meet a friend in their illness. Doctor Marcin Kosiński is not only an outstanding specialist, a great doctor, but also a good man in human terms. Grateful Mikołaj Cz . from Wrocław ."
3246,"The patient was a 6-year-old girl. The visit itself was conducted in a pleasant atmosphere. The doctor has a very good attitude towards children. Unfortunately, I have to assess the level of consultation as weak. The doctor received a detailed list of drugs taken by her daughter so far. The daughter was taking Pronasal - Mrs. Doctor prescribed Nasonex, a medicine of exactly the same composition. Daughter was taking Petit Drill - Mrs. Doctor mistaken for Pecto Drill and told her to stop. Unfortunately, the whole thing was discovered only at home after checking the composition of the drugs, so in addition to the lost time, an additional loss of 300 zł for the visit and 'new' drugs. I hope that our case was however isolated: )"
3247,"They spent 10 days there. We came back very pleased. First of all, the location in the very centre of the bustling city made it an unforgettable holiday. Clean rooms, towels changed daily. It is noisy, but what to expect from a room in the center. The kitchen is lacking equipment, but the washing machine is running smoothly. Check-in takes a few moments. You can leave your luggage after you check out. Overall we were very pleased."
3248,"A very good doctor when it comes to asthma treatment, regardless of its causes. She found me in a severe condition and after only two years of treatment she forgot what it means to suffocate. It is worse when it comes to the treatment of allergies, but in fact, the doctor is very sympathetic and dialogue oriented."
3249,"The mouse generally works very well, but for a player like me the lift - off distance is terribly annoying. A mouse after lifting a few millimeters still works which makes lifting the mouse when the pad ends is terrible because the mouse goes crazy when lifting and the viewfinder flies in different directions. I previously had Kinzu v2 and there were no such problems. I have to use insulating tape on half of the sensor, otherwise I would not be able to measure precisely. I'm a little disappointed. The sides of the mouse, which are anti-slip, make my hand sweat even more."
3250,"Hotel at the Market Square, private, free parking on a fenced area. Large room, clean . Very comfortable bed. Air conditioning as standard. Bathroom also very large and clean. On the minus side the lack of lift - for the elderly this may be a problem. Breakfast tasty although the choice is rather modest. Very nice and professional service. If you get a room with windows on the Market Square, at the weekend you have to reckon with loud music until the morning - opposite is a club with disco, which you can hear mini closed windows. In general, I am very pleased and highly recommended."
3251,"After more than half a year of treatment, there was no improvement. Mr. Piotrowski only if he is in a good mood he will listen to the patient. Unfortunately, most often it looks different . He does not listen, does not try to help. His opinions are quick and very superficial. He does not draw conclusions as to why someone has a particular problem but criticizes it. He lacks empathy and understanding. After a few minutes he can give a prescription and thinks it will change the patient's life. I'm very disappointed and disgusted. He's not a professional who cares. The bad contact with the doctor, if someone cares about time or opinion, is to meet only with an oil from his side. I absolutely discourage you from staying away from this gentleman."
3252,"She pointed out that obesity is a very complex disease which leads to very large health changes and consequently to premature death. As she said, it is ok. 50 factors that can cause obesity, e.g. environmental factors (diet, lifestyle), but also medications taken, emotional disorders. ""If a pre-obesity condition appears - as doctors say - then it would be ideal for every patient not to look for diets on their own - a miracle on the internet, but to go to the doctor, to check up, because maybe this overweight is due to the poor functioning of the body"" - she explained. She assessed that patients rarely decide on treatment with a specialist. ""We still don't realize that obesity is not an aesthetic defect, but a disease"" - she emphasized."
3253,"The IT commercialization was one of the most successful in terms of profitability of sales of companies from the tourist group. Out of 15 companies associated with the tourism and accommodation industry, which were included in the privatization plan for 2008-2011, by mid-2010 only two were sold, including IT . But did the state do good business? Science and knowledge cost a lot, but without them it is difficult not only to talk but even dream about development and progress. Photo: The current seat of the Institute of Tourism is located at Grochowska Street in Warsaw's Praga district. The building (the first one on the right - behind the trees) is adjacent to the picturesque Kamionkowskie Lake located at one of the most beautiful parks in Europe - Skaryszewskie Park."
3254,"The treatment of small tumors not only promises to be better, but does not always require immediate treatment. All you have to do is observe if the tumor is not getting bigger. ""Some of them develop slowly, in such situations you can wait until the disease progresses,"" the specialist said. Such a strategy is used in the case of prostate cancer in men. It can also be used for kidney cancer patients when the tumor does not exceed 3 cm and is not enlarged. The treatment consists mainly in surgical removal of the tumour or the whole kidney. When the tumor is not big, it is enough to cut out part of the kidney. The choice is then a minimally invasive surgery involving the removal of the tumor by cryoablation (by freezing), radio frequency waves, laser or ultrasound."
3255,"Great disappointment after buying a projector. It's hard, and even impossible to set the focus. (always one of the edges is blurred, as not the bottom is the top) . The manufacturer boasts that the projector gives 100 inches of experience, with an image size of 50 the projector set em on an even surface so that the image fell perfectly perpendicular to the white wall, you could not set the focus, and the multimedia presentation written in font 14, in some places was illegible. The keys on the projector are clumsy. Connecting the device to the PC and flash memory is easy . Small, handy device, which is its only advantage . For this type of device, the resolution of 480 x 320 is insufficient. I do not recommend . It is better not to have a projector, or to pay 1000zl and buy some proven equipment."
3256,"I don't know where to start. . . A room that's supposed to be okay, cleaned up superficially, in the corners of the dirt. The cistern barely clings to the wall. Generally, room 5 / 10. Medium service, unfortunately you can not say that professional. . . Embarrassing breakfasts (since 9 o'clock there was nothing), 2 kinds of cold cuts and cheese, possibly a sausage as you ask for (I guess breakfast buffet is not about asking for food - for horror). It is hard to park on a microscopic parking lot (more people than places. More expensive than the competition in a similar standard. I will never stop there again."
3257,"I know doctors who know medical knowledge equal or superior to your doctor and a visit is cheaper. 150 PLN for a visit is not adequate to what we receive. Squalid waiting room, at 30 degrees. C outside is terribly stuffy, an ordinary fan from Obi for 30 PLN . It would solve the case, but apparently too expensive. For this money, he would expect me to be treated better by the auxiliary staff and to keep to the prearranged time of the visit. Punctuality at your doctor's is not his strength, two visits and twice an hour's slip. The approach to the patient is weak and knowledge? . As predecessors wrote a lot of money, it is not expensive, just the economy. For me it is very weak in comparison with other doctors, but it is my opinion."
3258,"Hello. She was a patient of the doctor's. Unfortunately, I don't recall our cooperation well. She did countless expensive examinations on the doctor's order, which did not result in anything, she took hormonal medications, which she should take under the supervision of a specialist in the hospital on top of that, every next visit to your doctor lasted 10 minutes - without a medical examination. It is a pity that such a kind man could not diagnose my disease was so ineffective and cynical. I do not recommend it - it is a waste of time and money."
3259,"I'm after a few visits to Dr. Milewczyk, I can tell he's leading my pregnancy. At each visit I am examined, the baby's heart is checked - and I always have clear medical information. When referring to the examination Dr. Milewczyk explains and thus justifies this and not any other procedure. He always asks how I feel if there are any complaints. Accordingly, but also gradually, I have had my hormone doses changed (hashimoto). The only thing that I can get attached to - in my opinion - is a little involvement in the conduct of my pregnancy - but on the other hand I am fully aware that with so many patients it is difficult to get involved in every case. I also wish Mr. Doctor further success in his work and the group of his regular patients!"
3260,"I do not recommend, the task for the space laboratory can not explain you have to sit at it a lot: ("
3261,"""Our product will be purified and therefore free of any ballast substances. It will contain phages that will be well characterized biologically and genetically. In the world ok . 5 companies have started clinical trials on purified phage preparations under the agenda of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. The doctor informs the EMA. The clinical trials database provides information on the clinical trials. The clinical trials database provides information on the use of the tested phages for the treatment of diarrhea in children, burns, shin ulcers and ear infections. None of these preparations are directly dedicated to the treatment of infections and blood infections in immunocompromised patients, including oncologists."
3262,"Although it seems a little funny for me to judge a doctor a patient who has no idea about the knowledge of things in the profession of an orthopedist, I will say that Mr. Pawel Ambroziak in a pleasant and professional way conducted the consultation. He recommended a detailed examination and professional rehabilitation, and not so far orthopaedists, on the basis of an interview, prescribed only anesthetic drugs and treatments that do not change your mood. I recommend your doctor to everyone who needs the help of a professional orthopaedist."
3263,"A micro swimming pool and running brats, the standard of pseudo-apartments to which you have to get up the stairs leaves much to be desired. The food in the restaurant is very poor! The worst beef cheeks I've ever eaten in my life, and I'm a fan of them and ate 'em in many restaurants in Poland and abroad. In general, I have the impression that the whole staff was taken from a round-up from nearby villages ! ! ! The lady in the lobby bar cannot even make a simple lemonade ! ! ! ! ! I would advise against it! ! ! !"
3265,"The hotel absolutely shouldn't be a 4-star Mercure hotel because it's very harmful to the brand. The staff refused to bring me food to my room, mini golf - a failure, the jacuzzi sucks, the air-conditioning system is hot, the attractions at the hotel are the swimming pool, the dirty jacuzzi and the non-working saunas. The prices of space, 3 tables occupied in the restaurant and the kitchen is not made, the staff are rude people, completely without culture, not to mention the fact that sometimes they do not exist at all. Luckily, my stay in this hotel lasted only 24 hours because I wouldn't last much longer. 2 positives from which my title is very comfortable beds and beautiful surroundings."
3266,"Nice accurate doctor talks to the patient as you need to do nothing promises the cause of the course and the end of the disease explains exactly I am the day after the thermoplastic procedure as it will continue to see 6 weeks of release for now but I think it will be very well recommended to everyone I recommend Dr . Łukasz Antolak . The only doctor with whom I talked for the last 10 years having problems with my spine, who looked at the results of the tests not in the description, but took an MRI plate and determined my disease and what is happening there with my tormented spine I recommend trustworthy lack of such doctors like him I greet all of them after the thermoplastic procedure"
3267,"Fridge bought in April 2012 . After 2 years and 3 months it started to freeze poorly and from time to time squeak - fixed . In the meantime the handles for opening the fridge started to crack. After 4 or 5 years, it stopped freezing - the service team found no refrigerant in the system - there is an internal leak and that there is no point in repairing it. For such a company I must admit that I am unpleasantly surprised. After the first failure, I had the impression that the fridge was turning on too often - this was reflected in the electricity bills. I must admit that the fridge is very functional and well designed from the point of use, but when it comes to durability it did not work out."
3268,"The Waldorf Astoria Hotel Amsterdam, located near the Herengracht Canal, in the UNESCO World Heritage Site, in Amsterdam, was the first to receive guests. It offers 93 rooms and suites and is located in six restored 17th and 18th century buildings. The luxuriously furnished rooms are in ochre shades with a touch of lapis lazuli and refer to the key of paintings by the Dutch painter Vermeer, the author of ""The Girl with the Pearl"". Each bedroom has retained its original charm thanks to wooden ceilings, winged windows and spacious bathrooms with free-standing bathtubs. The dining area consists of the Hotel Restaurant Librije s Zusje Amsterdam, Maurer Room, Armillary Sphere, Waldorf Astoria Peacock Alley and the Vault Bar. The banquet and business part of the restaurant includes the Hooft Ballroom with its windows overlooking the picturesque canals of the city. The hotel's garden area includes the Guerlain Spa, which includes three treatment rooms, a sauna, a steam bath and an indoor pool with heated water and a beautiful view of the private garden."
3269,"A hotel at the highest level. Metaphorically and literally. Every detail has been worked out, professional and friendly service. The climate and view is breathtaking. Hotel by the forest, on a hill where everything seems to be better ; - ) High level decoration with coziness but without excess. SPA Cabinet that puts people in a different state - professionals themselves. Words of appreciation for the Chef, each dish is delicious and stylishly served. I recommend: )"
3270,"Prof . Dziadziuszko added that creating something like a genetic portrait of a cancer already translates into the possibility of treating certain groups of patients with the help of so-called molecularly oriented therapies. Scientists hope that in the future these possibilities will be even wider. The effect of molecularly targeted drugs is to block the defective protein that is produced by a given mutation or genetic change. Its activity leads to uncontrolled replication of cancer cells. These drugs are much more selective than classical chemotherapy and sometimes prolong patients' lives much more. ""We have examples of patients who used to live for a maximum of 6-9 months and now live for 2-3 years, work, and lead an active life"" - said professor. Grandparents. He added that there are also other examples of targeted drugs whose effectiveness is much lower."
3271,"Hotel unfortunately 4 / 5 * only with name and price. The ""modern"" room with a surcharge for the sea view that Grecos offers is in fact a clinic with excess of unnecessary furniture and a bathroom at the level of a roadside motel from the eighties. The view was, yes, but in front of it there are bushes and a busy street which also generates a lot of noise at night. There are no sockets in the room - you have to disconnect the TV to recharge the phone or not to store your own things in the fridge :) Apart from the swimming pool and a nice view, there are no attractions in the hotel, even the lack of a bottle of water in the room - everything is additionally paid for. The multi-storey hotel is also disturbed by the lack of elevator - it's not about laziness, but for example, carrying a pram up the stairs. The service is correct, but do not count on too much openness and smile. One of the few advantages? Wifi on the premises and in the rooms . And finally, this bathroom again. . . . .not for the money."
3272,"Security and the need for presence are considered both in terms of image and business. The hotel is an investment for years. So visually there are no shortcuts, because they can only harm us in the long run. Financially, we always operate on limited resources so it is not worth investing resources (personnel and money) where they do not bring a return. The only situation in which he would consider the appearance of different types of booking portals, not quite certain, would be a branding campaign of a newly created facility. Though here too, all the pros and cons would have to be considered, taking into account what 'em have written above."
3273,"I went to Dr. 2 years before my pregnancy, I had endometriosis, Dr. Milwicz generally prefers to prepare patients for the worst than to delude them with the chance of treatment, he also told me that if he decides to have a baby, we will stop the hormone period and then go to work, And luckily I have my mind so I didn't swallow the pills if I didn't have any endometrial cysts, my mind told me why ""if nothing strange happens in my body, fortunately it turned out that it didn't take so much time to get pregnant, 3 months. After the prophylactic treatment according to the doctor (I did not take anything) it turned out that I am pregnant, of course a lot of tests during the pregnancy, but I will not complain about it because for the sake of the baby you do everything, dr was always nice to me at least once she experienced a trauma when dr was asleep but with the awareness that everything is ok with my pregnancy it was not such a terrible experience, my daughter was born by a doctor who was taken by dr Milicz, she is a healthy 4-year-old girl, I will say yes dr Milicz met my expectations but girls have their minds because doctors are not judged."
3274,"At the beginning I will write that my visit took place at the NFZ. Maybe I'm not old, but I don't think it's appropriate to call the patient ""you"" and that's the way he turned to me after asking me if I had a fake jaw and then he sprayed ""strange if she was 20 years old! "" . The gastroscopy itself was without anesthesia, but I'll skip it, maybe that's the specificity of this place. After the examination, the Lord gave me the result and paid our visit ""please go to the one who sent you here"" . That's it. I won't go to him for these sprains anymore. Maybe if the visit was private, the behavior would be better?"
3275,"The hotel is dirty, the room was probably not cleaned too thoroughly, when from the stay came back m with an infection, which treatment is already 2 months. Generally this hotel chain was well remembered by me, but now it will change. I do not recommend it in Poznan."
3277,"Let's start with the information that the hotel has four stars. A short conversation with the staff will dispel the illusions, the Hotel has 3, 5 stars. At the end of the description you will find picturesBut let's not anticipate the facts ... ... . . this is not the first surpriseI) The room where we spend our time: 1) Very poorly working air-conditioning2) The sofa, beds, bedside tables, table bear the traces of many years of use3) Appearance of the shower and the washbasin (words won't describe it, photos at the end of the description of the whole hotel) 4) The cleaning staff pretends to do something ... . and when they clean it is only for the eye (bed linen, cosmetics arranged) but on the floor without changes. 5) When entering rooms on higher floors I do not recommend using a railing. Not only is it scratched, but it is sticky and dirty. (although it is painted ... ... ... in black) II) Kitchen + canteen1) Unwashed cutlery, glasses and plates. The quality of the entire kitchen service leaves a bad taste (cracked cup ears, scratched plates) 2) Pitched, worn and dirty tablecloths. When a guest finishes his meal, the service and tablecloth are changed. The change of the tablecloth consists in turning the ""other"" side ... . How simple it is . 3 ) The chairs and tables are not stable, they creak and move. 4 ) Communication problem . Lack of language skills of the staff . 5 ) The staff can't seem to see that the glasses, cutlery or drinks are running out. 6 ) But the room is carefully watched . When a hotel guest appears in the room ""without any wristband"" the waiter appears at the table with the bill. III ) Pool and drink bar in the pool . 1 ) Opening hours , The pool is open from 10 : 00 to 20 : 00 . View of children and adults waiting for the opening of the pool to occupy the lounger ... ... ... Valuable . The staff and the Directorate inform that it is not possible to book sun loungers (leaving towels and other things on them) and the staff will remove them , The staff cannot do it because either there is no or only one person. Although there is also a rescuer, but he does not do anything except ""watch"" the prettier tourists. 2) Not enough deck chairs in the pool. The occupancy of the hotel in guests is full. 3) The barbecue grill and the sausage heater should already finish their lives in order to, even for pure decency, not ""bullets"" in the eyes of hotel guests4) Dirt, the stench of spilled colored drinks and alcohols (on the bar and the floor) - this is how you can describe the pool bar. IV ) Bar froth1 ) Air conditioning did not work for the first week. The staff informed that the air-conditioning system will be repaired"
3278,"Hello. We came to the hotel in August last year (11-12), traditionally on the anniversary of the city. A year earlier we had been in the Paszkowka Palace, but the hotel delighted us more. A beautiful lilac room, a nice park, we managed to take a walk during the breaks of rainfall: ) . The object is clean, pleasant service. Color therapy, sauna, all on a high level. Unfortunately, we did not manage to use the restaurant Old Bowling alley, which we counted very much on because it was closed. The palace restaurant is on an equally good level. I recommend it especially to couples in love."
3279,"I recommend this hotel for a short stay. The rooms are clean, basically the whole hotel is clean. Room renovated, comfortable bed. You could not hear the street (6th floor). A little tight but for 2 - 3 days ok. Good food in the restaurant - prices to be received. Close to the old town and to the museums. The only failure in the hotel is the price of parking 60 zł / day. As for this class the hotel is a massacre. When travelling in Poland on business, I usually pay 30 - 40 PLN / day (e.g. recently in Radisson in Krakow paid em 38 PLN / day) . So it's no wonder that the parking lot is empty. I know that this is a 2 star hotel, but in most hotels you can already make yourself a tea or coffee (equipped with a kettle)."
3280,"The resort is located very close to the beach and very close to the lake. Access to the beach by a path through the forest . Descent to the beach through a dune - rather difficult to overcome for people with a wheelchair, or the elderly. The surroundings of the resort are sad, unseen. The whole area is lined with bone, no greenery or places to relax. There is a swimming pool and an internal playground for children (we did not use them so I do not judge). We booked a room with a view of the lake. At night a beautiful view, but during the day in front of the lake a view of the adjacent plot with the remains of rubble from the demolition: ( When we booked, we asked for a room on the top floor ( 7 ). We heard that it was impossible, because the last floor is being modernized. During our stay we saw our guests entering the last floor - an unfair approach: ( Big rooms, at first sight clean. But a fold-out couch in the middle is covered with old, uncleaned food. Although it was known that we would be using the extra bed, there was no trouble to clean it. No phones in the rooms. To ask for the couch to be cleaned you have to call the reception desk with your own phone. We started our stay the day before the holiday package started. We came for dinner and our first disappointment - to eat leftover cold fish, some cold chops, hard beans and cold water to drink. A massacre - a non-circumcised meal. The reception desk, when asked if this is how all meals will look like, helplessly shrugged their shoulders. On the luck of the next day (Christmas package) was better. The meals were rich, varied but very average in taste. The holiday package included breakfast and dinner. When I booked, I was assured that the restaurant would be open all the time and we could buy an extra meal during the day. It turned out, however, that the kitchen did not have enough staff to prepare a meal from the card - we were told that we would wait at least 40 minutes. And sooner we could only get a pizza - pathetic: (It's not cool that you mislead customers when booking. The Christmas atmosphere is missing (outside the bases on the tables) . Tablecloths on the tables only for Easter breakfast . Other meals on paper pads with advertisement of the resort: (Restaurant decor rather on the level of a fast food bar. If the resort wants to organize Christmas stays, it still has a lot to learn. We would rather not use it again: ("
3281,"I don't require ""miracles"" in a 3-star hotel. I require it to be clean! That the hotel is clean can certainly not be said about Britannia in Edinburgh ! The bedroom is dust-free, with a thick layer of dust on the carpet. The armchair, the cupboard tops covered with a layer of dust. Mirrors erased . Walls beaten and with disgusting stains ( ? ) Kettle and tray stick to dirt. Dirt in the bathroom is unimaginable ! Black mould on the ceiling, which threatens health . On the wall by the toilet seat brown disgusting stains, I prefer not to think from what. The top by the washbasin dirty with toothpaste from previous guests. . . On the ""decks"" of dust. Grey towels, which are better not to be touched. The staff is not very helpful and splashy . Disgusting, hideous, dirty! I advise against it ! The only advantage is its location. However, I think that for the same money you can find a well-located, clean hotel."
3282,"I have mixed feelings about this product. She had problems with dry skin and at one point she decided to move me with all the impetus to rescue her ; ) Among carefully selected creams and masks there was also a place for these pills. After some time, the condition of the skin improved, but when she finished one pack of capsules, she did not reach for another one, and yet my complexion remained in a satisfactory condition. I think it's a good ""booster"", maybe it enhances the moisturizing effect, but it certainly wouldn't count on me doing miracles. I recommend you to try it out, because it certainly won't hurt."
3283,"I've been treating Dr. Nazim for several years. After his last visit, she decided to give up his services. He answered my questions about pregnancy with hypothyroidism only briefly and as if from an unwillingness. She felt as if he thought I was a stupid patient, who is not worth explaining anything because he will not understand anyway. I think that the reason for the lack of interest was the delay in admitting patients. It seems to me that he has too many patients and he doesn't want anything anymore. My first visits looked completely different, it is sad that his attitude has changed."
3284,"Your doctor's approach is very routine. No concrete details except the suggestion that all treatments are possible here and now, for a large fee. The child had a hearing loss due to oversized almonds, and eternal infections, but this has already been stated by another doctor, who has carried out a proper examination of the child, at a much lower price than Dr. Bill. Wow. As the child required immediate surgery, he also suggested where we could seek help from the NFZ, without a one-year waiting period."
3285,"Eurostat estimates that 1.6 billion overnight stays in hotels and hotel facilities (including guesthouses and motels) in the European Union in 2011. In Poland, the number of nights spent by domestic guests in hotels increased by 9%. This trend is pleasing, although it is not unique, as the Eurostat data show a clear trend of growth of internal markets in the countries of our part of Europe. In Lithuania it increased by 20.6%. In Lithuania it increased by 20.6% and in Bulgaria by 15%. In Romania, by 13.4%. In Latvia by 10.5%, in Latvia by 10.5%. In Estonia by 9.9% ."
3286,"They are cheating the guests, we reported the number of people and on the spot they told us to buy another apartment because they found out that there are too many of us. The manager at the reception desk was not very nice to us until the whole thing was red out of anger and then he just ignored us without looking at us and not even saying good morning what would happen to him if only out of courtesy. Generally the atmosphere of the hotel is tragic! ! ! ! I do not recommend especially to organized groups! !"
3287,"She got mr. T . A peckerwood 10 years ago, I am now ""repaired"" 3 times by an extraordinary specialist. Currently I am waiting for another treatment and I hope that this time Mr. Doctor will put me on my feet. He will approach the patient concretely, explain with understanding, dispel the fear and anxiety of the treatment, and after the treatment, relief from pain and finally sleepy nights. The doctor by vocation, kindly with a sense of humor, which is important for the patient before the surgery. . I recommend to thank Mr. T Krzeszowiec for his professional approach to the patient and successful surgery. I am currently 23rd day after the next surgery (6 screws in the lumbar region) and for the present day I have given up my p / pain medication. I would also like to thank the whole staff of the department. Greetings"
3288,"The Doctor was very nice. The visit started at an agreed time. The interview was very thorough. The doctor ordered a number of tests, not concentrating only on those related to the thyroid (she was treating me for hypothyroidism at another doctor, and yet she was eternally tired and sluggish). The Commission has also taken into account other possibilities, such as vitamin D deficiency in the body. So far, my impressions are positive, but I will be able to say more after the tests and the follow-up visit. - For the time being, it is too early for a more accurate opinion."
3289,"A very good doctor, a very resilient one, on his knees he knows himself like no one else. And as for the Traffic Clinic - I do not know a more professional and better oriented to the customer. Nice and helpful ladies at the reception, who are able to save you for rehabilitation even to a competitive rehabilitation company - I witnessed this situation! And all of the physiotherapists are great ! The best shoulder specialist in Warsaw - Andrzej Kępczyński, I am his patient and whenever something happens to me, I call him."
3290,"The doctor has very casually told me what's wrong with me. He suggested cryotherapy without mentioning a word that it could be painful. During the procedure he didn't even ask if I was OK. After I left the office, I got weak. I went to the toilet where he noticed that the treatment caused the bleeding. I wasn't prepared for that either. So my first visit to proctology was rather traumatic."
3291,"Safety in electrical engineering (lecture) Electrical can be, sometimes boring, but also more interesting lectures on the average colloquium passing the lack of a rigid neutral OK Classes with Prof . sometimes boring, but also a little more interesting (average in the standard: wink :) . The presence is not checked . The only condition is to pass the circle at the end of the semester. The list of questions is available to download as much as possible: mrgreen: although there used to be someone else in the room to watch. To get a pass it is enough to read the answers several times. : ! NOTE: some answers on the A 0 list are wrong. In general, BwE is a peak 8 )"
3292,"It's been a long time since we ate such an unsavoury dinner. We visited the hotel restaurant in April on the occasion of the action ""Gdansk for half price"". We treat this event as an excellent way to get to know new restaurants. For the restaurants it is also a chance to get new customers, especially as the hotel restaurants do not know why, they are not very popular among the local community. They ordered trout in beer cake with seasonal vegetables and a salad with chicken, corn, boiled egg and toast. The visual side discouraged us from consumption. We felt like in a milk bar. The very taste of tragedy . . . . .chicken in a salad probably from a microwave oven, dressing is the same mayonnaise. Seasonal vegetables turned out to be frozen from the bag. . . If you have to feed your guests in this way, it is better not to take part in this food festival in Gdansk. You're making yourself a good anti-publicity. For dessert, I'm sending photos . . ."
3293,"The location itself and the glass wall in the bedroom is something beautiful. The design is very nice for the eyes. Although the toilet on the way to the entrance to the shower is something like ""the architect cried as he designed. A comfortable bed. And that's it. The reception is nice, but open from 8:00 to 20:00. Terrible disorganization in the reception and service. Being after the 21 keys milem pick up from the security, but the security guard was very upset that he knows nothing, but after persuasion finally released the keys. He asked em to replace the towels after 3 days stay. He did not live to see 'em so after another two days he went to get them himself. Cleaning the rooms only at the client's request, but even then it does not look too good. As for the ""hotel restaurant"" and breakfasts it is very weak but cheap because 25 zloty per person. But probably not this target. 4 / 5 because really the proximity of the sea delights and those views from the bed. But it's not the only one so close to the hotel/apartments."
3294,"I don't recommend it. It does not give any specific information about the health of the patient, you have to guess everything. Throughout my entire stay in the hospital of my loved one, I did not spend as the closest family of the patient even 5 minutes talking to him. And the aneurysm surgery failed. Unfortunately I have very bad memories after contacting this doctor. Dr. Palka does not know what empathy is, at least in my case it was so."
3295,"I've been Mrs. Beata's patient for 10 years. She led me out on a straight line after a serious car accident, a broken pelvis, stretched cervical vertebrae, etc. Later on she had another incident as a result of which she suffered a shoulder injury and a fracture of the 4 thoracic vertebrae. She is regularly rehabilitated because of the post-traumatic degenerations that have occurred. One visit to Mrs. Beata brings relief and immediate improvement. A few series in a row makes me calm down for at least a year. Mrs. Beata is a high-class specialist, excellent knowledge, experience and great intuition. She senses the patient and recognizes the cause of the condition. A specific person, who is very nice and warm at the same time. At the same time full of power and strength. I have not met a better physiotherapist than her. I recommend it to all my friends and you. She is really great! Additionally, she inspired me to change my lifestyle and nutrition. To start taking care of your health and physical condition, because it is really worth it! And she is a great example of that! Thank you Mrs. Beato : ) Lidia Stankiewicz"
3296,"She would like me to complete an earlier review, which I completely agree with. The rooms were cold, no heating and cold water in the taps in the morning and evening, where it was difficult to wash. Unfortunately it was not a successful trip."
3299,"The first time I stayed overnight in this hotel in 2013 about then I was very pleasantly surprised, so in July 2017 decided to visit this place once again. Unfortunately, what found em was terrifying. The hotel is already suitable for renovation. The room where they stayed overnight was bitten by a tooth of time, felt really unpleasant to em. The bathroom was neglected, the bathtub with the curtain sticking to your back while bathing. The top was a dirty towel left on the hanger, still wet, wondered for a while before me, someone was not taking a bath there. Before I went to bed, I had to eliminate two large spiders on the ceiling so that they wouldn't accidentally fall into my bed. Then another unpleasant surprise, which was a dirty (stained) sheet (like in a fairy tale about 7 dwarves - someone slept in my bed?). A macabre breakfast, 39 pln and there is nothing to choose from. In a word MASAKRA ! ! ! I really do not recommend . To the management I suggest a visit to Campanile Bydgoszcz, maybe it will draw appropriate conclusions ."
3300,"Unfortunately, it is not as perfect as it appears from the above opinions. There is not the slightest comparison to high speed blenders of renowned brands. If we dream of cocktails, yes . . . . . It actually works great with kale, spinach, lettuce or carrot. They also grinded dried fruit if it is thrown into the liquid. They'll crush the ice in a drink. If you want a sorbet from just frozen, for example, strawberries, then unfortunately. . . . We will not do it with this device either with a small amount of cream cream or with a little more milk (so as to get sorbet) . The device is also loud, but this is a feature of all high power blenders, I was counting on it. The chalice is solid, aesthetic, I have not happened to suck in so much that I would have a problem with taking it out. Plus for fixing the cup on the click (by turning the jug), without locking it in the base we will not start the device. Generally it is a good blender for cocktails but it does not delight."
3301,"We spent 3 nights in the hotel using our privilege room. The great advantage is the location on this unfortunately the advantages for me are over. The room was big and clean, but you can see that time stopped here a few years ago. I was disappointed to see that the towels and bathrobe were very worn out and should have been replaced long ago. The bathroom was clean, but you can see that someone tried to renovate something, but not very well. The mini bar in the room was not replenished after the previous guest, the parking ticket did not work several times Everything was immediately replenished/repaired but definitely more pleasant to rest when you do not have to ask for something that should be / work. The bed is quite comfortable while listening to the guests in the next room. . . We used the hotel because of the good reviews but in my opinion this place is not worth the price. I recommend looking for a newer hotel."
3302,"The hotel is located by the lake, in the very centre of town. It has several rooms of a very high standard. The rooms are large and well equipped. Each room has a different decoration. Bathroom is clean with large windows. Downstairs a very good restaurant serving delicious dishes (probably the best in Szczecinek) Breakfast is very good. Service both at the reception and in the restaurant on a high level. Everywhere clean and tidy. Tiny minus for the lack of blinds in the bathroom."
3303,"the way your doctor's manner leaves much to be desired, but. . . . . . . . . . . . .not for everyone. If someone can appreciate his dedication to what he does and trust him, then, as with my children, 100% accurate diagnosis, professional treatment, everything else does not matter. And by the way the doctor can be very nice, although he is not always communicative. Everything is forgiven for his professionalism!"
3304,"Dr. Jamont removed the growth from my nose. Because of the size of the tumor, it was necessary to supplement the defect with tissue taken from the cheek. After the stitches were removed and the medication was stopped, I did not feel much pain but only itching from time to time. The wound healed well. The visible scar is small which is a big surprise for me. Knowing that this is how it will look like, he decided to have the treatment 10 years earlier, when the change was small. Mr. Doctor is a professional who decided ""you have to cut"" convinced me to undergo the treatment, for which I am grateful to him. Indecisive - I recommend it!"
3305,"Fellowes cloths are very high quality. They are odourless but sufficiently soaked in cleaning fluid . They clean very well and usually do not leave streaks on the objects to be cleaned. The cleaning agent from the surface being cleaned evaporates very quickly by itself. It is excellent for cleaning smooth and rough surfaces . The packaging shown in the picture above may not be very convenient for the user, as the wipes sometimes rub off or come out for several. The wipes dry very quickly in hands because the cleaning agent evaporates from them. The same is true when the whole package is worn out - if we do not use it quickly enough, the wipes will dry in the box. But I generally recommend"
3306,"This is not a 4-star hotel. Minus: - yellow tap water - broken air conditioning - rusty curtain tube - dirty bathroom - small old TV - empty bar - feather cushions - broken electric kettle - small , old and worn out towels - decor from the 90's - no electrical sockets available - empty bar - no safe in the room - low water pressure (15minutes to fill the water baths) - expensive breakfast - fitness center - one bicycle, one treadmill and gym for 480 rooms! Pluses : - location and nothing more"
3307,"The castle hotel makes a really good impression on the first contact and so much for the accommodation. Dark room, soul and certainly not with 4 stars. Kitchen good without reservation, I will recommend."
3308,"Having many symptoms of hypothyroidism / Hashimoto ( my mother is ill with it ) she enrolled in the doctor last September. A tragedy. . . . .nothing ZERO interview! ! ! The doctor just asked: how do I feel? A. . . - differently. She didn't go any further. . . . .nothing! ! She told her herself that my mother had her thyroid cut out and was diagnosed with Hashimoto. Yes, she did an ultrasound at my request. My thyroid was less than normal. And then what? Nothing. And I'm still tired of the symptoms of hypothyroidism. She was supposed to come in now in March, with more results: TSH antigens FT4 FT3. I won't come, it's a waste of time, nerves and money. And my mother what drugs she prescribed. . . doses. . . . . .it's a pity I don't want to say anything about it. Avoid the wide arch! There's no one to go to, no expert. . ."
3309,"I fully agree with the entry from ewa29 . I also have very mixed feelings. For a few years I have experienced both a nice, kind and committed approach of Ms. Dr. and a complete lack of interest, not to say disregard. I have no idea what that depends on. Generally speaking, the balance sheet is that she has decided to change her doctor, because I just need to know what else I expect and need from the doctor as a professional and as a person. It is worth to check and find out for yourself, but because I use this forum myself - looking for doctors of various specialties - she also decided to speak to me."
3310,"Clean, quiet rooms, comfortably furnished. Each room has a bathroom with shower. My room had a balcony. The staff at the reception and restaurant were very friendly and willing to help. Meals served without any problem by the waitresses. Meals very good and large portions. Excellent location of this facility makes it attractive all year round. I recommend ."
3311,"There were no precise regulations on organ procurement for transplantation in Poland yet. The Act of 1948, which was in force at that time, concerned only the cornea removal and obtaining tissues from the deceased, and not organs. However, kidney removal from the deceased was then considered to be a preliminary stage of the autopsy. This interpretation was also supported by prosecutor Zygmunt Papierz . In this situation it was not necessary to ask the family for permission to take an organ, but this was not concealed. At that time there was no concept of brain death yet. Its first criteria were developed in 1968 at Harvard University. Therefore, although the kidney donor for Danuta Milewska was a woman who ""died from a severe cranial injury"". As it is written in the hospital protocol, the collection of the blood was waited until the blood circulation stopped. It was only then that the death was found, although the kidneys were often severely damaged, they were not always suitable for transplantation."
3312,"The hotel looks old at first sight. . . . . .unfortunately, when you enter the reception desk, you can only be sure of that. I wouldn't mind the price. . . . . .but this terrible smell. . . . . . . .with moisture. . . . . massacre! Walking up the stairs to the room doesn't look encouraging (they could at least change the carpet in the hallway) . The room stinks of moisture and I don't know what I think the stave squeaking under the old carpet gave such a smell. . . . I'm lucky that it's only one night because I couldn't stand it any more. . . . . .in the 90s, she used to go to better hotels on the colonies. . . . . .as far as restaurants are concerned, the food is pretty good but, for example, at an organized event, it's supposed to get better and poorer on the tables. . . . . .you want to have guests, start slowly modernizing the rooms and the whole thing. . . . . .the neighborhood is nice but it won't make up for the quality and opinion. . . . ."
3313,"I was going to buy it because supposedly tectonite is a super revolution and so on. But after reading the reviews, I went to the store to grab the goods and unfortunately I confirm what people are writing here. . . . .everyone on the edges scratched / unpainted. In my opinion it's a poor imitation of granite because in appearance and feel it seems to be ' plastic ' PE . No wonder it's half as cheap and light as that. Admittedly, I tried to scratch it with a nail but I failed : ) so here's a big plus. In conclusion. . . . .I prefer to add to the granite and know what I have."
3314,"The food ordered before 20 : 00 terrible (Polish cuisine) old frozen dumplings, potato pancake from the package, all cool. . . stained tablecloths, dead fly under the napkin. . ... more we didn't eat there anymore, the room was dirty: dust on the radiator, dirty bedding, cracked and stained walls; fatal cushions and sheets as if from a leopard. . . balcony (extra charge) is 1,5 square meters + a spilling chair + falling tiles; in the bathroom a damaged cistern and leaking shower ŻENADA, standard of a roadside motel. . . ."
3315,"Hotel in good standard, nice service. There were small faults, but also not very troublesome, because if someone comes to the sea it is rather not to watch TV (not working remote control, one night light also did not work). A tidy room, with a dressing room, a nice, clean bathroom. I can't say anything about food because I didn't use the restaurant services, but you can buy meals. The hotel is located in a very good place - near Biedronek, an intimate but inexpensive and good restaurant Veranda Express, near shopping centers (Alfa, Real) and SKM station. The hotel is located by the Reagan Park, a walk through the park for a few minutes and we are by the sea. I recommend."
3316,"To Dr. . The whistles hit 'em completely by accident: D After the first ever visit to a cardiologist, I got 'em referred to electrophysiology. He started calling various clinics until he finally found 'em on the long one :) When I called 'em to register, the lady told them that Dr. D . She was just whistling next to her so she'd give it to me. Instead of making me wait for months in line for the NFZ, Dr. Gibbs said that I should come with the results the next morning. It was funny, incredible humor, positive attitude and respect for the patient. He immediately ordered a holter and an exercise test. Unfortunately, before he did it, he got 'em to the hospital, just at that time, Dr. was on vacation. A long holter was performed, after which they went to see Dr. Gwizdała with the results, and told em that in 2 weeks' time I was going to Bon Jovi's concert and wanted to live to see him. It turned out that Dr. is also going to that concert. But to get back to the point. Some time later, I got 'em back to the hospital in the cardiology department. The doctor insisted on doing an electrophysiological test and got 'em back to Dr. Bishop. Whistled. There were such eggs during the procedure that I even remember him with a smile on my mouth: ) Unfortunately, I still don't know where my tachycardias are coming from, but I know that Dr. . The whistle is specific and if my ailments were cardilogical, he would find them. I recommend this doctor with a clear conscience: ) Tom."
3317,"The hotel is perfectly located, right by the sea, quiet and peaceful. Room well equipped, kettle, refrigerator, daily mini bar. Safe is available. Good service, breakfast served to the room without any problems. Very pleasant infinity pool on the terrace, suitable for people over 16 years old. The swimming pool complex is small but sufficient, with paddling pools for children. Two sauna zones, one defined as the total nudity zone. The only thing that was missing was a real closet (with shelves)."
3318,"Nice and new rooms, clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, we had a view of the car park. The downside is the lack of balconies. The hotel is beautifully situated on the shore of the lake. Not very big swimming pool, 2 saunas. The only thing that bothered me personally was to leave some of the walls unplastered, unpainted and the rooms and the pool - it looks messy and completely luxurious, just like there are a lot of glass and other glass elements that are dirty from fingerprints etc. - If you want to have them, then unfortunately you have to take care of them. However, the biggest plus is the super breakfasts - I often stay in hotels, so I know how it is, everything is of the best quality from bread, to cold cuts, salads, cakes and all this in the beautiful dining room overlooking the lake."
3319,"Over the last five years, more than 600 hotels and 24 thousand rooms in hotels have arrived in Poland. Growing demand, EU funds, preparations for Euro 2012 and good - despite the changing global economic situation - forecasts for the tourism market have resulted in an unprecedented investment boom on the Polish accommodation market. Between July 2007. Between July 2007 and July 2012 the number of hotels operating in Poland increased by 42%. The number of available rooms in hotels increased by 47% . The number of available rooms in hotels increased by 47%, according to an analysis prepared by the Editorial Office of ""Hotel Management"". This increase was possible, among other things, thanks to over PLN 6 billion, which were estimated to have been spent at that time by investors, mainly domestic ones, on the construction and modernisation of accommodation facilities. Among these 600 hotels quite a large group are the pre-existing facilities, which, after thorough modernization, were for the first time categorized as hotels."
3320,"In Poland, almost half a thousand accommodation facilities are for sale. Although the number may seem large, it is less than 5% of hotels, guesthouses, resorts, holiday homes and other tourist accommodation facilities present on the market. Although investors have a lot to choose from, and thanks to the supply they can count on attractive prices, there are relatively few transactions this year. Especially the larger ones, which concern hotels located in large cities operating under the banner of international groups. For example, the Europa Hotel in Lublin is currently being sold."
3321,"The hotel would certainly not rate me as 4 star. It's nice, clean, proper service, just meets the minimum necessary requirements. Nevertheless, in comparison to the age of other hotels that are theoretically on a similar level, the hotel is not performing well. Bathrooms in the rooms are arranged in a very impractical way - no space for cosmetics - no shelf, even no cup for toothbrushes. In the room there are numerous faults, a broken basket, poured parts and although every day someone comes to clean and ""stumbles"" about it, it is not fixed. We had a stay on New Year's Eve, so I understand the occupancy rate, I'm less likely, however, perhaps the poor coordination of the facility manager made the hotel staff overloaded and overworked and did not keep up, which translated into quality. And the biggest failure was the New Year's Eve party, which was supposed to be in Cuban rhythms and in our room the music was provided by a teenage boy playing disco polo from his computer. . . PORAŻKA"
3322,"She visited this place several times during her holidays this and last year . It certainly has the advantage of being close to the sea, but the whole Hel Peninsula has this advantage. The resort offers brick houses and wooden twins - > all suitable for renovation. Under each cottage you can park your car, but under the brick house on the so-called ""squeeze"" and under the wooden house freely. This year she lived in two different wooden houses, in both houses some of the sockets had no power, the bathrooms were dramatic, the cabin was molded, the fixtures were dead. The wooden cottages are bunkers, upstairs there is a room with 3 beds, downstairs we have TV, fridge, cabinet with basic dishes, bed or two. Last year she lived in a brick house and it was hardcore. The cottage was completely suitable for demolition, and one night the pipes were thrown out there and we were flooded, so we moved out of it. The resort has its own canteen and offers boarding in the formula of breakfast and dinner. A couple of times it used to benefit from the food, but the children did not like it and we fed on the town. According to me, the only authentic advantage of this place is the unlimited possibility of coming with animals. And indeed, there is a lot of dogs meeting there and nobody bothers."
3323,"She was on a paid visit, which lasted max 5 - 10 minutes. The doctor did not tell me anything but prescribed Duac ointment. When I was 24 years old I came to her with an acne problem (usually temporary or single pimples, which, however, I have had continuously since high school). She asked me what could cause it, what diet to follow, etc. She did not specifically answer any question. In turn, I am not satisfied with Duac's ointment. Sometimes BEFORE I look worse than after using this ointment, which irritates me a lot - the skin flakes, is red, with dilated pores (the dermatologist warned me about its effects), but with my acne, which is often sporadic, simply does not pay off. If I were to go to the dermatologist again, I wouldn't think she would choose me again."
3324,"Terrible place. At 8 o'clock. 30 no anything to eat for breakfast, only at the request of the staff brought the food. Dirty tables, even at the request of the ladies did not want to clean up after previous guests (only laughed in the face) were too busy with themselves. The hotel was very noisy. Not very pleasant smell in the corridors. Reception staff very kindly ."
3325,"I am here for the second time, and the last time outside at night about 4 degrees Celsius and there is no heating, despite the request for some electric heater, then unfortunately we have received an answer from the lady that we have blankets and such luxury in this hotel for 180 zł."
3326,"The hotel is located on the outskirts of Moscow near the river and in the immediate vicinity of Crocus Market Hall. If you are going to the local fair - it is a good choice. The hotel will not surprise you with anything, just a nice room, clean bathroom, comfortable beds, nice view of the river. . . . .and all in all, that's it. Such a bedroom. Service on 3, food is quite weak and monotonous (especially breakfasts every day the same). The restaurant staff would have assessed me as good if it wasn't for an incident with one of the dishes that she wanted me to advertise because it was disgusting (no reaction from the waitress). So in general - if someone is not very picky they would rather find themselves here, but the food is not recommended."
3327,"A beautiful, picturesquely located place, suitable for any age group and fantastic service. Tasty meals ż big choice for everyone. Clean and comfortable rooms with bathroom, air conditioning and TV. Beautiful garden where everyone will find a place for everyone to relax. Functional playground for children located near the tables where parents can relax while sipping delicious coffee and watching their kids. I recommend ."
3328,"It's rather not a hotel, but a few buildings that have been adapted for hotel rooms have been converted into ordinary apartments. He was 'em on vacation with his son. The apartment that booked em had a total of 3 bedrooms (only one was at our disposal), a kitchen and 2 bathrooms. We had this whole apartment to ourselves. There is no restaurant in the ""hotel"", so we ate outdoors or made a meal for ourselves. It was pretty clean. No towels. The kitchen has a microwave, fridge, electric cooker and pots, plates, mugs and cutlery. The thermal pools are about 15 - 20 minutes away on foot, 5 minutes by car."
3329,"If someone reads my reviews, let them know that as a rule I don't write reviews, I'm just in some place, that's all. Today, however, I have to admit that I was very surprised every evening when I came back to my place in the hotel I had tidied up, fresh water, towels, bedding. . Beautiful view from the window, very nice staff, silence in the room, the reception desk handles things very professionally even at 5am. I did not meet any hidden costs about everything I was informed about. I highly recommend the stay for those who appreciate cleanliness, tranquility and moderate luxury. I recommend! And forgot to add that the price of the hotel is access to super fast wifi, which made our stay even more enjoyable."
3330,"I recommend a beautifully located hotel with a view of the port. From the window you can admire the pirates ship passing by: ) The rooms are standard with interestingly made furniture. Breakfast buffet is typically hot eggs, sausages from the heater. In general, the hotel inside does not knock down, but is very well located."
3331,"A medium shelf hostel . Convenient location, close to many Dutch shops, where you can buy things other than the chain stores. The room was so small that we tripped over each other's legs and kept our suitcase under a chair. But when making the reservation it was written that the room would be small. The sanitary solutions in the bathroom were simply idiotic. Opposite the shower without a cabin was a toilet, so after taking a shower, the bathroom literally sank. You had to wipe the floor with towels to move around the bathroom. The plaster was falling off from somewhere, because you could see that there was moisture. But you can't say that the bathroom was squalid. If it wasn't for the flood, it would be okay. Beds are very comfortable. It was ok in terms of cleanliness, but our room unfortunately stinks. Maybe we had bad luck and only in ours, but I can't judge that. The hostel is good for max 2 nights and only for the night."
3332,"The hotel is very cool - it could be perfect but it has shortcomings - no hot water in the tap especially in rooms with final numbering. Medium cleanliness - see the wardrobes in the rooms - cleaned at all or poorly. Lobby café defeat - annoying, 4 stars we sit down 20 minutes before closing and the bartender says that he will no longer accept the order - defeat . The organization is poor - the offer to meet with an astronomer, theoretically two groups - only the astronomer does not know anything about it - we are unlucky to be in group two - unfortunately there is no apology. Food in heaters cool and unfortunately weak for 4 stars - vegetables zero nothing. Hotel unfortunately not for 4 stars * People are generally nice - but so heartless to the customer ."
3333,"Medium-sized, old hotel, more than 1 * wouldn't give, clean beds but old bathrooms, tasty breakfast, close to the aquapark and so many advantages. If there is no place, you can stay overnight there, although a big night than 1 night is not for me. The service is nice and helpful. No elevator, stairs to the main entrance."
3334,I did the ears on Dr. . the man's a tragedy he's not even in surgery. And you can't see him after the surgery. The suture catastrophe was supposed to go away by itself and it's been a year and a piece of suture is in one ear. I advise against your guy getting fat and nothing else. . . . . . . . . .never again to a blowjob.
3335,"Generally, this man is nice. He exams students in the department, even speaks a bit of English (I think he runs exercises for English-speaking students) - so many nice things about him. Concretely: a few years ago the man removed my tonsils. He was appointed to operate on me by the head of the laryngological ward of the Visitor's department (some old grandfather - I don't remember his name). Generally, the hospital staff was nice and sympathetic to me (before and after the operation) that I found 'em on Pabiszczak. For three weeks, he was bleeding like some four-legged animal, whose name I won't mention (it starts with ""ś""), and which we often eat in the form of loins. The doctor, when he graciously let me ''shoot'' at the ward, explained to me that such a complication is typical for a 10% adenoid excision - end and stop, no further discussion. Well, I checked em the professional literature and such a complication is typical only for 1 - 2% in the U.S. and the UK and the bleeding lasts max . week / two . Maybe there are other standards in Poland? ! It is unprofessional . One of the tonsils has not been well (completely) removed. Non - stop I have ailments ( pains ) associated with incomplete removal of the tonsil . I strongly advise against it."
3336,"Compared to Rynia, there is no climate or spirit. The kitchen and the service in the cafeteria (you can't call it a restaurant). Very nice SPA and a nice swimming pool with saunas if it wasn't for the decoration of a'la palace of the Russian Nouveau Ruthenian. The town itself is a pleasant but terribly boring. In the hotel, a mass of hopeless children tearing their snouts at the potege without any supervision of parents, a pile of German excursions ( Pensioner Reisen ) making the crowd everywhere. He would leave me a lot more money if it was where - the lobby bar is boring and without climate . He is dying compared to the night club in Ryn where he drank 'em a few national averages ; - ) . Generally you can spend a few days here but don't set yourself to 4 star level - I give a strong 2 star ."
3337,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! ! ! BEWARE! ! ! ! This lady ( supposedly a doctor ) prescribed me a medicine in the composition of which was what I am allergic to (of course she told me what and it was written in the file). She almost paid for it with her life. She swollen my face so my eyes could not be opened. If the night had lasted longer it could have been after me! ! ! ! ! To be a doctor you need to know! Constantly improving one's qualifications and constant learning, because medicine is a field that is constantly developing. . . . It's a waste of words . . . I will never trust a doctor again! ! ! BEWARE! ! ! !"
3338,"The hotel stopped by the decor and everything else in the old days. Mustard sofas, a televiser from 1964, elevators from the 1970s, you can smell the old oil and cigarette smell everywhere. Each floor has a sofa from another parish and some strange furniture. For such a price it's some kind of massacre. I do NOT recommend ( y ) ! !"
3339,"Hello, and I share all the opinions about . Mr. Dr. Adam Sikora. You may not believe it, but I was operated on by the doctor (together with Mr. Wencol) and a very damaged section of the lumbar spine here NOTE - 1981! ! ! ! He was young, but already then he approached everyone with commitment and heart. He was a doctor with a CALL. After so many years, I have no problems with my spine (unless I exaggerate myself). After so many years, she noticed that she is still an APPROACHED man and a doctor. I greet Mr. Adam Sikora very warmly and wish him satisfaction with his work and success in life. Grateful patient Grażyna Dreja Tuszyńska ."
3340,"So far in my life I have found only two really good doctors about whom I can say in good conscience that they certainly did not miss their vocation and Dorota Stelęgowska - Piórkowska is one of them. She is polite and presents a high personal culture, carries out an in-depth analysis and really tries to help. If there were more such doctors, people would feel at the visits of people and the treatment would really aim at helping them - which I have the impression after visits to many different specialists, ironically, you can not guess."
3341,"The biggest disadvantage of the hotel seems to be poor wifi. It is not available at all in the rooms, and also at the reception desk it does not work well. You can also criticize the not very rich breakfast. The products are not signed, so you do not always know what you are eating. In addition, the food quickly disappears from the Swedish table, so the later, the less choice you have from a modest buffet anyway. These are, however, only details. All in all, the hotel presents itself very positively. The apartments are spacious, the balconies with views of the ocean invite you to change rooms and everything is kept in perfect order. I can safely recommend this hotel, also because of the quiet, attractive surroundings."
3342,"The hotel has a fairly industrial climate, universal, good for business visits and for tourists not looking for an individual atmosphere. Definitely an attraction is the location by the river with a well maintained terrace, promenade, greenery surrounded by well-kept office buildings and tenement houses. Clean, bright and quite spacious rooms with large windows. Good buffet breakfasts in the restaurant room and on the outdoor terrace are quite varied, including self-pressed fruit juices, salmon, cheese, pastries and tasty coffee. Nearby there is a park where you can walk to the city centre, although the distance is considerable. Nearby are the stations of the city railway. Apart from the immediate surroundings of the hotel, the district itself is quite busy and a bit neglected."
3343,"Electronic Measuring 2 , Exercises What exercises does the cards do for 5 minutes and stands with a watch passes 5 minutes and no apology the card you have to give back. Before I thought about the task, it was already a piece of paper: (But somehow I managed to pass. The doctor explains quite well, but everything speaks in one tone of voice without getting too busy! He is literally speaking the rules from the books! The score is based on the marks from these pages and the answers at the board. We think he did okay. 6 sheets of paper and then the arithmetic mean is drawn! My advice: Avoid this lady as she fights! !"
3344,"We spent one of the least successful Easter Worlds this year. Even though the weather wasn't good, we couldn't get bored. The hotel with a great focus on families with children and here great appreciation for the team of animators, always smiling, very committed and with a great approach to children! ! ! ! ! Activities for children without a few, all interesting, fun and teaching. From painting, cutting out, cooking and arcade games to discos and theatres. Just a fairy tale. Adults could also learn a lot, such as first aid. The organization wasn't even spoiled by the rain and all the fun, bonfire, mulled wine and baked sausages went well! Delicious food, clean everywhere, very nice service. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to rest and have a nice time. We came back delighted and will surely visit this place again and again! ! ! !"
3345,"Nevertheless, the prices of accommodation here have remained relatively high, reaching 111 euros. During the European Football Championship, you have to pay an average of 184 euros for accommodation. In Warsaw, May prices jumped by 23.60 percent and amounted to about 107.58 euros. Due to the occupancy rate so far, guests staying overnight during the championship have to reach even deeper into their pockets and pay an average of 175 euros for a room in the Polish capital - twice as much as last year. Among the world's metropolises New York proved to be exceptionally expensive. Eurozone guests had to pay 18% more, i.e. an average of 223.19 euros per room due to the weak exchange rate of their currency."
3346,"Rooms with significantly different standards. The first room was exchanged for another, which we were satisfied with. Comfortable mattresses in beds. The swimming pool is very decent for hotel conditions, two small saunas - one is always about 90 degrees Celsius, the other is either closed or 60 degrees Celsius. The food is rather average. The choice is sufficient (always fish, poultry, beef, vegetables, peanuts, groats) but somehow not so good. Unfortunately, summer food or even cold food is the most common. Hot only soups. For lunches there are no drinks, not even water. We bought the soups separately - a glass of wine 8-12 zl, a tasty beer Prost 18zł (Zywiec after 10). The place rather as a starting point to Czocha Castle, Grodziec Castle, Goerlitz, Bolesławiec. . . . Two billiard tables in the cellars . The hotel staff is very nice."
3347,"Professor Kafarski is a very nice man who has a lot of knowledge from his specialty. . . . Lectures are conducted in a way that is accessible to the student. There are 2 colloquia for the credits, where you can have books, lectures and what else can be helpful to pass. . . . The examples in the colloquia are quite specific, at first glance you might get scared, but if you think about them a bit, you can pass. . . If you don't count one of them, don't break down, just go to Professor Kafarski to make an appointment for a correction. . . . [ u ] Generally speaking, he is a very good leader. . . I recommend it! 8 )"
3348,"Mrs. Łubiarz is a good doctor but my opinion is neutral. She told me that I have had painful periods unfortunately no prescription or information about what painkillers I should take. The second thing Mrs. Lubiarz does not prescribe contraceptives, so I immediately warn the ladies and girls that if you care about contraception it is certainly not at Mrs. Lubiarz unfortunately."
3349,"I do not recommend ! I wouldn't have gone to that doctor's in my life and she wouldn't have paid for it. Last year, unfortunately, I had a miscarriage at the hospital with an empty fetal egg. Unfortunately, I had a miscarriage at the hospital, an empty fetal egg. Unfortunately, I was unlucky enough to find this doctor, and during the examination he was so delicate that he broke my vaginal speculum. I was still surprised that the examination was painful, I just had an indescribable nightmare in my life and she wouldn't have believed me if it wasn't for the fact that I had experienced it on my own skin, a dramatic approach to the patient! I would totally advise against"
3350,"The doctor, after examining my daughter, informed me that the child can hardly see, because he has a very large visual impairment. She was advised to give atropine for 5 days and return to the examination again. She also immediately got me the information that the result would be worse than the one without drops. The next step will be to buy glasses. I'll add that my daughter is an infant. What are the reasons if you can verify this, check again - too much has not found out m . She only got the information that while giving atropine there may be side effects and in case of more serious problems you have to go to the hospital. The message was passed on to me as well as the information about the almost blindness, as the information that the child has a cold. On leaving, I was in shock. After a few days, when she recovered, she decided to verify it with me. I went to two different ophthalmologists. Of course, she did not say that she was already at the doctor's and that I have opinions that the child is visually impaired. None of the doctors found the defect of which I was informed. In addition, I was informed that the administration of atropine for 5 days to such a small child does not currently apply. Of course, it can be examined, but after the child is asleep, or as one of the doctors did - in the office (twice a drip and anaesthesia). That is why I do not recommend the doctor. Thank you"
3351,"Well, she only had to spend two nights in that hotel. She was m with a Groupon voucher, unfortunately nothing good will write, just the truth. She asked the receptionist if all the hotel guests are treated the same, are the Groupon guests worse? The first night in a three-person room, there was one set of bed linen missing, she reported to me several times, at 9 pm. 45 I was promised that within fifteen minutes somebody would report it, unfortunately, no one will report it until the morning. The squalid, stuffy rooms. The windows cannot be opened because they disturb the bunk bed: ( . She wouldn't call me a restaurant but an ordinary canteen with not interesting food. In my opinion, this hotel does not deserve three stars . and the next purchase of a trip on the groupon will be more read in the opinions on the forum ."
3352,"The hotel is completely sufficient The standard of rooms from the 80's, but the rest of the hotel does not deviate from the standards of a 3-star hotel. Food: although there is not much choice but a lot of vegetables, I have always come out very full of them. Breakfast is repeated. Pools. Garden. All right. To the beach far away, 600m, through the fields, hotel far from the city. Clean overall, so we are satisfied"
3353,"A big plus for the website, it was like in the American ( ?) movie: you need to consult a specialist and there is such an opportunity, register through the website, then confirm, remind, in a word SUPER! The visit to the doctor's office took place in accordance with the specified time, we received the appropriate consultation. The doctor felt that he feels responsible for the patient he met, he provided a telephone contact. I think that in the future, if necessary, we will use the services of Dr. Dr. Polewiak. One remark: please give us a little more time, 15 minutes is really not much, a little like a conveyor belt. . . Thank you, Dr. Stuart. Polewika for his professionalism and kindness. BJCh."
3354,"The hotel is a beautiful, charming place in a historical environment. During one day of our stay we spent time visiting the castle of the museum standing in the same courtyard as the hotel. Well, the hotel's awards are well deserved. The hotel has a different, beautifully and interestingly decorated interior, especially the generally accessible (stylish restaurant, swimming pool), a very neat combination of new and traditional in a luxurious setting. The hotel attracts attractions from the physical through the spiritual (beautiful library) to the culinary. I recommend it."
3355,"As IPC PAS specialists explain, the new polymer was made by molecular printing. The lipocalin molecules were first surrounded by appropriately selected short polymers (the so-called ""functional polymers""), which bind to this protein in places characteristic only for it. Next, a second polymer was introduced, which was bound to a functional polymer . ""The crosslinking polymer was later polymerized and then lipocalin was washed out of the resulting structure. Eventually, a durable polymer layer with molecular hatches adapted to the lipocalin molecules in terms of their local chemical properties as well as size and shape was obtained"" - reads the IPC PAS message sent to PAP. ""When lipocalin molecules in the solution tested come into contact with the polymer formed in this way, some of them have a chance to be located in the gaps. However, proteins are quite large and are reluctant to migrate through the polymer network. Therefore, the structure of our polymer had to be artificially loosened, enough to give the lipocalin molecules the best possible access to as many gaps as possible, but not too much so that the polymer layer would not collapse"" - describes Dr. Noworyta ."
3356,"I don't know what to write. . . . .I've been seeing a doctor since my previous pregnancy. . . . . The fact that I was privately treated by a doctor was a chance for me to get a birth. . .

3357,"As many have written before, the hotel's glory days passed some 10 years ago. Faded photographs on the walls testify to this. Unfortunately, all of them from a decade ago. Nothing works as it should. They save ( or rather happen ) on everything that is possible. Wifi only in the common area of the hotel but the speed of the internet is so poor that nothing works. It's a big inconvenience especially since the hotel is in such a remote area that there is practically no cellular coverage. In some rooms it's just cold - at the reception desk they give fags. The water in the tap cannot be called hot. Foods of little and poor quality - the cheapest mortadellas, seropods and water with thickened syrup. You can feel like on the colonies . . . Service limited to the minimum - the lifeguard at the pool is both a waiter and a receptionist. It is also possible that you are a smoker and a supplier. Some people speak only Ukrainian and there are some communication problems. I do not speak about the spa area because I did not use em"
3358,"Today, dinner with the family because the favorite restaurant is all over the place, decorate it like a milk bar. . . . .but that's not why we went there. . . . . .but the food. . . ...a tragedy, a roulade of cheese burned, a salad certainly not the first freshness. . . . quite small portions, a wife of roasts and 4 noodles, a broth as if from a cube. ...prices like in a nice restaurant. . . . . .burnt down premises as for us. . . . . .and the abdominal sensations. . . . . .not recommended."
3359,"She bought me this tutorial in a set with two records. She didn't have enough jamming to get to the end, but the first lessons she did, they really gave me a lot. Each lesson starts with a situation (dialogue) in which words and grammatical constructions explained later (that is, classically) are used. Quite a lot of emphasis is put on phonetics (because Hungarian phonetics finally differs strongly from Polish phonetics). And without a record, don't move! I think it's a good tutorial and I'll definitely come back to it when I have more time for pleasure!"
3360,"The first impression is very positive. Clear display , AM 6 . 17 runs smoothly . This is where the advantages of the device end . Navroad S6 operates for max. 40 minutes on battery . The entire device heats up strongly during charging . A significant temperature can already be felt after 10 minutes . If you pair this device with your phone and want to use it as a hands-free kit, you will hear fuzzy gibberish. It is not suitable as a handsfree device . There are forums where you can hear the feedback about the battery capacity and overheating of the device that the service is sending the device back and describing it as should. Unfortunately, our navigation switches off after 2 hours of operation and helps to disconnect the charging handle several times. There is no point in writing about the advantages of the device since it is not possible to use the device normally for more than 2 hours (not to mention e.g. 16 hours with two drivers of course :) ) . Sorry that the device is so advanced, it works in this way. It is already 3 Navroad and satisfaction with the device loses 1 : 2 with dissatisfaction . Satisfactory device refused to obey after 3 years and Navroad service refused a paid repair due to lack of parts."
3361,"We spent the night exploring the mine. The location of the hotel is not very relaxing: near a large market and a road. Nevertheless, the room is quiet. From the mine 15 minutes walk . Inside very nice and tasteful. Modern but cosy interiors. The service is nice, but a little bit poorly organized. A little professional sanding is missing. Breakfast ok ."
3362,"Quite a typical guesthouse by the Baltic Sea, far too expensive in relation to the standard it offers. Rooms equipped with not very sophisticated furniture, but quite functionally. Double rooms located on the ground floor - dark, without charm. Bathroom OK, but also without a frenzy. The building is very acoustic - you can hear all the neighbors, their conversations, steps, swimming, etc. Quite tasty and varied dishes at breakfast. Comfortable parking by the building. The transition to the beach - through the forest, short and quite nice. Beach without crowding. The offer could be considered as attractive if the price per day for a few days stay does not exceed 220 PLN for a room for 2 people."
3363,"My child's wedding : ) . a very clean room, although tiny - applause for the cleaning ladies : ) for about two months I have been waiting for the call of the coordinator of the wedding in an important matter for me - the receptionist can confirm, we are already after the wedding and the woman is not calling yet! Shock! I don't think I'll live to see it, well paid! I, as a mother, had a wish for every single hot dish - fish, well, it was a total chips! she gave it back to a random waiter - who asked the question - what happened? she answered m . . . . - Well, I don't know why. . . ...without a response from the kitchen! while the waiter who served our table all night - bravo - is the pride of the whole staff - thank you : )"
3364,"I decided to write, maybe somebody with chronic sinusitis, with frequent colds, blocked nose for years and headaches will read it and decide to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery. I don't regret having excreted 5. 000 zloty because that's what it costs in Medi Clinicue. Otherwise I would have to wait in the hospital for this surgery for 1 or 5 years. If you have chronic sinusitis, don't regret it, sell a car or anything else and have an endoscopic operation, you won't regret it (I'm currently unemployed and not regretting it). When you air yourself through your nose, you'll forget about the money you spent. After the surgery, do not wait for the effects, in my case only after two weeks the ventilation in the nose has definitely improved and the pus from the clotted blood has started to flow intensively. After the surgery, all control visits to the doctor. After the surgery, all the follow-up visits to Mrs. Paradowska (there were three of them) are free of charge. TO SUM UP - I RECOMMEND - MEDI CLINICUE AND DR . PARADOWSKA ARE THE BEST"
3365,"After a slightly disappointing stay in 2012, the next ones were fine, and the present is nice. Despite the long weekend and the hippie competition, there's no squeeze. The reception desk has risen to the challenge of combining several reservations into one and assigning rooms next to each other. If spg.com's reservation system still wanted to reflect the real availability of rooms, it would have been beautiful. And Iva , GM Sheraton Sopot , as usual , smiling"
3366,"As for the start, it's a very strong 4 with a plus: ) to Friday, a little more work: ) . General evaluation: center 4, 5 / 5, rooms 4, 5 / 5, kitchen 4, 5 / 5, swimming pool area and saunas - 4 / 5 (proposal to carry out more sauna rituals - people who do not know it will surely like it : )"
3367,"He took advantage of the promotion which included one adult and one child and it was a good option. The standard prices in this hotel would have been too high for me, and thanks to this promotion he gave 'em the chance. The highlight was the daily activities for the children: the treasure hunt, the knight's ball, etc . The swimming pool is tiny but very warm, which was a revelation on cold days. The food was tasty - my daughter was cutting pancakes - although at the end of my stay I missed my home one. The lake is not far away. We just missed a little bit the bosom of nature, because it is a town. Generally I highly recommend, especially this promotion."
3368,"Beautiful hotel. Built in the old style . Rooms quite spacious . Large pool, nice saunas. The hotel is a few years old. Nice service. Price of accommodation low but space catering. Around the many attractions: zoo, sealarium. From the downside Chef to exchange . I do not remember a long time ago when I ate something so bad. Zurek not edible for 16 zł . Fried fries in old oil. Meat during dinner dry and unbrittle. Pâté not edible . Dry plum pork loin . Generally very average kitchen . At the owner's place he would think about changing the cook."
3369,"I also had the opportunity to meet Dr. Wojciech Kamyk. living on ŻELAZNEJ Street with his sick lying mother, who is 87 years old, Mr. Kamyka took care of my mother and I would like to say one thing I have never met in my life such a dedicated doctor, who has his big heart in relation to the elderly. We know perfectly well let's say to ourselves honestly how nowadays elderly people are treated by the health service I'm not afraid to say here and use a word like a necessary evil . But in the Lord, the doctor did not count the age, the man did everything he could for this sick person to do the treatment, administering the drip at home being nearby on the visits he could come and check how his patient feels in spite of the fact that the visit was not reported. I will also mention the approach to the patient - a sincere smile, a nice conversation between the doctor and my mother, it seems to me it was bigger than anything else, it gave me faith in healing and restored faith in the fact that there are great doctors. for this today, even though my mother is dead for 4 years, I would like to thank the doctor for everything once again for his heart and goodness. . I WISH THE WHOLE HEALTH CARE SERVICE AS MANY SUCH DOCTORS AS POSSIBLE WITH THE RESPECT OF THE DAUGHTER OF ŚTANISŁAWA PALUSZEWSKA ANNA PALUSZEWSKA"
3370,"I advise against it. The visit cost 105 zloty in January and lasted 5 minutes. The cork on the trampoline got some weight. After a month, the next visit - we had an appointment for 17. 00 and we entered the office around 18. There were 2 people in front of us, who were not registered but the doctor asked them. When I asked why the patients were treated this way I found out that it is so and the visit lasted 5 minutes 105 PLN and you said that your daughter must have no antibiotics. She wrote down 5 packs of antibiotics to ask me if these antibiotics wouldn't harm her, I found out that aspirin is also harmful. The doctor didn't want to answer my other questions, she just invited me to visit in a month. We gave up."
3371,"You see, this doctor knows a lot about what he does. I've been with him for the first time, I'll be back. Although I'll admit honestly that he rejects a little of his arrogance. She tried to explain to him that the menstrual disorder (in the range up to a year) I have from PCO that I was diagnosed with. He interrupted me in half a sentence saying that he wasn't asking me what he was suffering from now. To sum up - knowledge at b . high level Behavior and attitude towards the patient - weak"
3372,"It's hard for me to judge a visit. I felt strongly ignored when asking questions about the test method, validity of recommendations and other questions. Besides, Mrs. Aleksandra was cooking dinner during the visit, she was quite bored with talking to me. . . She heard that I am infected with everything, I have cancer suspicions plus a whole lot of other conditions so she came out completely broken down. . . No approach. . . I don't judge completely wrong because the recommended supplements are herbal and have health reasons while this lady's personality doesn't appeal to me at all."
3373,Hotel very old neglected lack of air conditioning They offer to rent windmills 1 . 5 € a day tragic food practically the whole two weeks we went to other restaurants in the city For a shovel you have to pay a deposit and was supposed to be in the room I do NOT RECOMMENDED Adds a picture of how this hotel really looks like
3374,"I advise against this doctor! He is not really aware of what is really wrong with the patient, he still has little time and you can't even talk to him about what he is planning to do. And if he is already treating it only according to the usual patterns, he gives you medication which instead of helping you harm the patient. Just because he is smiling does not mean he is a good doctor. Watch out for what he's giving the patient and what medications. He does not inform about the effects they may have on the patient. This is a taboo subject. He is definitely not the doctor she would recommend to me."
3376,"The stay would be quite successful if it wasn't for the noise from behind the wall. Almost all the time, night and day, you could hear the noise, the whirring, the time of tapping. During the day it was not a problem, but at night, unfortunately, you could not sleep normally. Maybe I was unlucky and got 'em a bad room. As for the other aspects of the stay it was ok although the rooms need refreshment and are regularly renovated."
3377,"Because 64% of holiday guests and 52% of business guests are not loyal to a brand or a particular hotel * . There are many reasons for this . Certainly one of them is the neglect of an attempt to build lasting relations between a guest and a hotel . What a certain premise is the result of the business segment . Where we have a higher percentage of loyal guests . However, one can think that this loyalty does not result from the relations created (although of course it can) but is based on a fleeting attachment based on a favorable, negotiated corporate price. The space of lasting business relations is still to be developed in the hospitality industry. This is confirmed by another statistic. 39% of potential guests prefer to sleep in a hotel that ""knows them"" as opposed to 21% of guests who choose a hotel that is alien to them, in the sense that they have no in-depth information about them. As we can see, the personalisation of services is already rather a current trend."
3378,"When confirming a reservation, when writing about the advance payment, it should be noted that its subsequent fate will be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the cancellation and cite them. For example: ""Cancellations : - If the client cancels the stay between 14 and 7 days before the planned arrival, the hotel will deduct 50% of the advance payment from the advance payment; - If the client cancels the stay less than 7 days before the planned arrival, the advance payment will be forfeited in full to the client (the type and name of the accommodation unit must be entered here). ""Such records clearly specify when and on what terms you will retain the advance payment. Of course, the dates and percentages can and should be adjusted to the individual circumstances of a particular facility. We are only allergic to uncritical extensions of deadlines. It is worth to get to know those that offer competitive facilities in the area or region."
3379,"The hotel has a variety of attractions to offer for the elderly and the youngest. The swimming pool with paddling pool, slides, monkey grove, children's entertainers, board games, table football. There is what to do with the child, even if the weather is not favourable, although the sea is at your fingertips. We were there in February and we hardly ever left the hotel. In addition, the food was great in the form of Swedish buffet, a huge choice and still the possibility of frying pancakes, which children have always enjoyed very much. We are very happy and we will probably come back more than once, especially in the off-season, when it's ugly and cold outside, and there you are lying in the Jacuzzi and it's good for you :) A little remark: I missed the water in my room, but it's probably a detail."
3380,"I advise against it. First of all, an unpleasant midwife who registers a visit. Once she was impatient, she hung up the phone halfway through the conversation, another time she didn't want to save me because there are no more places in a given week (I asked for next week - what's the problem?). At the first examination she spoke to her doctor about worrying symptoms, but she quickly ended up with me because she did not show any interest in my statement. Then she examined me and found nothing. She mentioned that I may have a back bend, but she is not sure because she did not examine me thoroughly! ! ! Only the examination from the lab showed inflammation (the symptoms of inflammation were the ones she was talking about). The results were not received until the third time, she kissed the door handle twice, and once there was no information about the cause and time of absence! It is difficult to get a call. Then the doctor prescribed me drugs for this inflammation without examining me at all! ! ! Why bother? Routine ! She also wanted me to be referred to a routine ultrasound - many diseases can be discovered only through this examination. She said no, because there are no indications. She went to another doctor (highly ranked doctor). She had an ultrasound (literally a moment) and it turned out that I had a cyst. If I had stayed under ""Muszalska _ Gawrońska's care, the ovary could have been excised, because she does not see anything disturbing! ! ! You can walk to her when you are healthy! But I advise against it anyway. There are more pleasant people."
3381,"The older building has a simulation room for practicing nursing and obstetric skills, as well as resuscitation, laboratory teaching of surgical skills and rooms for practical exams in clinical subjects. In the new building there are high fidelity simulation rooms, including a hospital emergency ward, intensive care, operating theatre and delivery room. There will also be an ambulance simulator used for rescue exercises. The opening of the simulation centre will allow for modern education of students from the faculties which are part of the Collegium Medicum. Before their first contact with a real patient, they will be able to practice all medical activities on phantoms and simulators, reproducing situations and conditions similar to real ones. As the Vice-Rector of Medicine said . As the vice-rector of the Collegium Medicum prof . Wojciech Maksymowicz , the simulation centre is still in its start-up period, but classes with students are already being conducted there."
3382,"I'm editing an opinion - I'm after my second visit. The doctor did not cure me, because the nature of the ailment turned out to be non-neurological. The doctor conducted a very detailed interview and analysis. She commissioned a very detailed study and discussed the results with me. She approached my state of health comprehensively, analyzed the whole history of diseases. After two visits to the doctor's office I have a 100% knowledge of the disease. After two visits to her doctor's office, I have 100% knowledge of my health in neurological terms. Apart from the great competence, I am also very communicative, with real concern for the patient's health, good heart of the doctor. Moreover, the doctor very much respects the appointments - the patient who came before me, but apart from the records, had to wait for my visit. 5 stars - no scale."
3383,"Clean rooms, cleaned daily. Good location . However, there will always be some but . . . when at the end of the trip we managed to use the spa area, it turned out that the water in the jacuzzi was icy (which we were not aware of, but we were with a child). On the balcony we could use a chair and a tiny dryer to dry our swimsuits (the bathroom had been drying for centuries). The food is okay, but after a few days, monotony creeps in. Breakfast is the same every day. For lunch every day chicken dishes in different versions, (apart from chicken there were also other dishes, but nothing surprising). I personally missed the fish. For lunch there was no drink (being in hotels in different countries, not buying all inclusive option was always free water! ) Internet does not work well, the range was only in certain places in the room. The service is nice and helpful. For renting new bikes, the possibility of using the tennis court - equipment at the reception. In my opinion, the hotel requires refreshment from outside (especially balconies)."
3384,"The doctor is a very nice person. She was answering the questions she was asking. She talked to the person she was visiting, that is my daughter. She explained what the problem was. She was in no hurry and absolutely did not let us know that there is another patient behind us. This is a big plus. I do not give marks for the competence and results of the treatment due to the fact that it was only the first visit (with the rest recommended by a satisfied patient of the doctor). My daughter and I are waiting for the results. . ."
3385,"I got the doctor by order of a colleague. I've been his patient for over 2 years and she wouldn't trade me for any other doctor even though the prices of visits aren't the cheapest. He is the only doctor who explained to me exactly what and how to do an ultrasound. Thanks to his help I am today the mother of a lovely daughter, at every visit he kept my spirits up and said that everything will be ok, despite my many doubts. I highly recommend it."
3386,"This is the first time I've encountered such an unprofessional approach to a patient. She came to me with a small problem on the foot which she cured a few years back using cryotherapy performed with professional equipment, with hygienic caps, on a couch, in appropriate conditions. How surprised I was when I saw a portable mini-case from which the doctor took out small dispensers with liquid nitrogen, then she leaned my foot on her thigh and tried to carelessly remove the warts with the help of two mini-bottles of gas, which is nomen omen in exhaustion. Without a closer look at my foot, without light, magnifying glass or anything - the Doctor asked questions of the figure ""And here was something or wasn't there because I can't see"" . For some of the changes there was no more gas, so she heard me say ""we'll finish it next time"". I absolutely warn and advise against it! I will add that the visit cost 130 PLN. In short - I do not know how the Doctor deals with other aspects of dermatology, in my case it was a real mistake and absolutely the second time I will not appear there."
3387,"You can see that the hotel is being extended because getting to some rooms is a real challenge. The rooms are neat, but the time tooth has already done its work with them, especially you can see in the bathroom. The food in the restaurant is very weak so it's better not to be too busy. The biggest advantage is the bowling alley, which is located at the bottom of the hotel."
3388,"Very comfortable beds. Friendly service - don't confuse this one with a restroom . Very close to Tampere Hall - just 2 minutes on the same street. Bathrooms quite small. Likewise, the rooms which in the pictures seemed to be much larger. The room has no cosmetics and no water. Medium food - a small choice for a 4-star hotel . Restaurant and its staff rather average . The food does not knock with the service you have to wait very long . The biggest minus for the cleaning service - I had the impression that they are doing the opposite. In general, paying 140 euros per day I require more. The hotel was rather 3 star hotel, although even in such a hotel I felt better."
3389,"The Doctor is specific, competent, listens, advises. He is able to take care of the patient's comfort during the visit. He knows what he's doing. I recommend recommend this doctor because the doctor is not our colleague but has the task of curing us. Mental illnesses have it to themselves that in addition to pharmacology, the doctor must somehow reach the patient, realize certain things and I assure you that Mr. Michał Suchorski does it. Personally, I don't like to be disappointed just as someone not emotionally connected with me is not afraid to say things that may hurt the patient at first. This causes a shock at first, but after returning home and rethinking the words of the doctor once again gives relief and helps to understand yourself and what the problem is. I highly recommend this doctor. He is dedicated to his patients."
3390,"KARCHER Evaporator KST2 SC2 1500W If someone needs to clean it, it should be able to do it, in my case I have not managed to clean the old air raid / dirt / stone. The evaporator did not cope with small raids on faucets in the kitchen and bathroom, the raids on the bathtub also did not let go. In addition, after a short time of steam cleaning, the pressure drops dramatically, worsening its efficiency. I used distilled water to avoid any limescale deposits or clogging of the nozzle. It was 'em about the step of adding vinegar hoping that this would allow you to clean the faucet on the sink but not to buy 'em this device for a few hundred zloty to use water with vinegar. To sum up, I didn't count on any miraculous effects, but this product is completely different from the manufacturer's assertions and therefore did not meet my expectations."
3391,"Yes, it is true that Dr. Milewicz is not a nice person. I was also impressed by the first time he made a very negative impression on me. However, he is an expert in his field and this is most important for the patients who come to him. Several times she wondered if I should not give up his advice, just because of the lack of cordiality and warmth, which we women expect from a gynaecologist. Finally, we ""expose"" ourselves to him and the body and soul. So far she has not given up on his advice. The competence of the doctor has prevailed. He has been treating me for half a year, I have been suffering from 2 or 5 hours of hard work to get to Krakow - but it is worth it."
3392,"I was with this doctor on one visit, looking for expert advice after the first bad diagnosis of another doctor for me. The Doctor was very effeminate and smiling, but he spent 80% of his visit promoting his person and his own competence, highlighting the fame he has worked with in England, who he knows, who he studied with, etc. He criticized the methods of treatment and diagnosis adopted by my former gin. He himself did an ultrasound (during the visit) on much worse equipment, which was not very visible in comparison to the previous pictures. He made a wrong interpretation of the changes on the ultrasound (this was not confirmed later by further examinations and treatment), he saw pathology where it was natural physiology. At the end of the visit he was shown his previous ultrasound and immediately changed his mind, stopped criticizing and agreed with the opinion of the previous doctor. The fact that he was strongly striving for my well-being, but he clearly wanted a good posting on the forum, which he himself emphasized and what he boasted about. On the plus side: he recommended that I continue to be contacted and treated by two outstanding specialists in the area that concerned me. These were very valuable and useful contacts, for which I am grateful to the doctor. Unfortunately, he is not a reliable doctor for me."
3393,"The location of the cottages is great, but it's the only plus of this place. When we arrived in the restaurant, the wedding took place for a while until we were registered. The first problem appeared on the day of arrival while serving a meal, dirty cutlery. The next day the waiter poured beer into a dirty mug and started wiping it with his finger. . . As soon as he drew attention to him, he remembered what he was doing. . To make the dirty cutlery more interesting during the 7-day stay appeared 6 timesBut the accumulation took place on the day like in a fried cabbage there appeared something that shouldn't be, a wireframe for scrubbing pots - Cottages are decorated ok, but the times of splendor are behind. There was a lot of dust, cobwebs and a stinking wet mop in the closet. The marital arches were very narrow and the mattress survived a lot. Sorry, but for such money. . . . . Never again. . . And I certainly don't recommend"
3394,my parents went away for a 7-day stay. . . .regeneration package. They came back very pleased. The food was very good diversified. Treatments very well done on modern equipment. Nice staff. Everything is great according to them. Close to the sea about 50 meters from the resort. They are so delighted that they plan to go for 14 days next year.
3395,"I've been using it ever since it came out on the market and it would give me the same advantages for this vacation. Not a single flea, no ticks despite, with hours of running in the forest or swimming. Unfortunately the year is either the critical year, or the vermin have become immune, or something is wrong with these collars - there is no day for me not to pull the tick. . . . . . It still works on fleas. My dog's last collar is 3 weeks old and still has a long expiry date, but this time I am not happy with it. However, because there is no better one (with a dog swimming or often bathed, there is no possibility to use other means) I can only recommend it, because although something ticks have it in their nose, it is still the best one available on the market. Today she ordered me another one (maybe she found me a faulty one) The small drawback is that this rubber can crack - we've already lost two of us."
3396,"I stayed at the hotel for one day. He took advantage of the apartment, which turned out to be very spacious and well decorated. Two bathrooms, two bedrooms, a wardrobe, everything on a high level. It's a bit of a pity that there was no bathtub in one bathroom. Cleanliness in the room and the whole hotel at the highest level, interestingly arranged lobby. The food is very good, breakfasts are prepared with high quality products and varied. I liked very much that in the underground car park the places are numbered and guests who choose the underground parking have their place guaranteed. Although the layout of the car park is a bit strange and it is difficult to manoeuvre a long car, but it is just a detail. Fantastic payday games prepared for children, with a fairytale castle: ) From the downside - a little ""pompous"" and not very professional for a class hotel staff at the reception, poorly equipped minibar, clearly different level of bartenders and the fact that some of the ""attractions"" are located in the Grand Nosalowy which means quite a long walk through the corridors. It is probably worth working on these minibars. Generally speaking, we will surely take advantage of the offer one day. I sincerely recommend!"
3397,"Fantastic location of the hotel - on the slope, a great place for skiers, a well solved ski room and basically it's all the advantages. The service is very unpleasant - for a week nobody smiled at me forcibly answered Good morning, Food - monotonous breakfasts in the form of a Swedish table - when you come down 1 / 2 hours before the end of dispensing there are no more vegetables which and early in the morning is very little, in addition, the service does not want to make scrambled eggs - because they do only 2 x , Dinners are small and untasty - and I know and like Czech cuisine very much - without comparison with previous hotels and restaurants in other parts of the Czech Republic, Unpleasant service - very clearly they let us know that they do not like Poles - unpleasant, they comment something under the nose, for the first time in his life he saw em a waiter walking around the room with his hands in his pockets, only 1 waitress speaks English, no tablecloths on the table - OK they only * * * but it felt like a bad canteen, you have to ask for a change of towels after a few days - the staff does not understand that the towel left in the bathroom on the floor needs to be replaced! ! ! ! to ask the staff - they say that after 4 days you should not! ! ! ! The bar is open from 7 . 30 to 24 . 00 , electric devices including kettles are not allowed in the rooms - so you will not drink coffee or tea at night if you want to read . My friend was taken away from the room a private kettle without informing her about it, even though she didn't use it - I'm glad she didn't take my laptop Smile. As he mentioned to 'em - bad food and a bar open till 24 . 00 and you are not allowed to bring food and drink ! ! ! A colleague who before his departure got sick children and came in 3 people instead of the declared 5 - for which he paid 50% - was ordered to pay 100% for 4 people even though he had a free cancellation option. To sum up - I will not recommend this hotel to anyone, potential guests should be warned before such hotels. The result - A group of several dozen people will go skiing in Slovakia next year. Greetings"
3398,"The best trainer I've ever worked with. Apart from that, he is young and nice : - ) he also communicates knowledge in an interesting way. He appreciates how someone tries, but he hates rudeness. Colloquia is not difficult - such a general standard. The naked classes go away in a pleasant atmosphere. Sometimes an unannounced piece of paper can happen, but shave is recommended!"
3399,"She has already used several different products, with different results but never as weak as Canpol. I'm broken down by how the producers can dim. On the packaging we will of course read that they are absorbent and make it easier to keep clothes dry and clean, etc. Bullshit, the lymph nibbles instantly soak up and break down inside, the lymph nib is small and the breast milk starts pouring over the sides of the lymph nib and dirties the clothes. The edges of the inserts are sharp, so the pleasure of putting them in is low and they lack as simple a thing as glue, so they dance in a bra. A great product. . . Seriously, each of the inserts used before were better. These bought me by curiosity and a suggestion from the seller that they are ok that they have a good value for money. Well, they don't have - they're cheaper but too small and not very absorbent, uncomfortable and unreliable. I advise against it."
3400,"No praise from superiors10 . Lack of care by superiors11 . Lack of commitment of all employees equally12 . Lack of motivation to work - not always financial13 . No physical protection14 . Lack of optimal working conditions. Each hotel has different chances and different barriers - which, as seen through the eyes of the employees - affect their work, well-being, productivity, quality. They also have an impact on staff turnover at the hotel. And in your hotel? Even if the issues overlap with the lists above, the order of the lists may be completely different, which means that they are important for the staff members. It is worthwhile to conduct such a survey at your hotel, keeping an eye on the methodology - to get to know the opportunities and barriers in the hotel as seen through the eyes of those who build the hotel's position on the market with their daily work."
3401,"I was recommended to see Dr. Anna by another very good doctor. Although this was my first visit and I had some concerns, they were not needed at all because she is an incredibly polite, kind woman who approaches her profession very professionally so she does not feel uncomfortable. She gives a comprehensive answer to every question. The atmosphere prevailing in the whole clinic is very nice every woman will feel important here, the decor is neat, has a feminine charm. I will certainly come back here one day. With a clear conscience I recommend ."
3402,"hhmm, well, then ride with that look and it's just that. As for the rest, the bench is not axial, unstable (practicing on the bench negative bevel I advise to put on a pamper).

The device for leg training escapes a few steps in one direction, the prayer book tragedy, the backrest for the exercise of the heel straps sitting on the seat is crooked, generally buying again he would choose to m Chinbork 1 , but not for 1800zł. In my opinion it is worth about 1100 PLN. I'm about 174 cm tall, of course, it's uncomfortable to exercise your shoulders on the lift, you will not straighten your arms. Generally I recommend TV Samsung Smart about 40 inches behind these pins and watching every day youtube about 30 - 50 min. would exercise m push-ups and such derivatives, the result is the same (if not better), and how much fun.

3403,English B 1 She is nice . The class looks like she's splitting up into pairs and makes her talk about the subject sometimes doing something from the book. Pass: calmly.
3404,"A hotel with a very good location and not bad standard, worse with customer service. Although she reported the lack of an additional towel at the reception desk and wrote the same in the survey, the request was not taken into account, and after check-out I was accused of theft. . . So I advise you to request it strongly and immediately enforce it in this hotel. Besides, the Dove dispenser was given me a non-branded liquid. No comment. . ."
3405,"He may be a good specialist, I don't question the fact that he has certainly helped many people, but I remember my contact with him as very unpleasant, even traumatic. I have a rather unusual health problem, which many specialists have unfortunately died of. Mr. Arthur also failed to find a solution. All right, it happens. In the course of this ineffective therapy, however, Mr. Arthur claimed that he knows exactly what is wrong with me. That I have a problem that I should go to a psychologist. He was afraid of the very negative consequences of a possible surgical operation. He reacted with anger (or at least I was so affected by his reactions) when she reported a lot of pain in his treatments, which did not bring any improvement (even worse was after a few sessions). After all, the therapy ""must sometimes hurt"". From the last visit came out m with crying . Many of his tips were certainly valuable, psychological therapy is also not a bad idea (although I do not know if the key to my illness), but the way of contact with me was very unpleasant for me, and scaring the consequences of the development of the disease completely unnecessary. Especially since she read a lot later about the disease, which she ""diagnosed"" me with, and these descriptions were very little in line with what I was experiencing. No physician also confirmed these hypotheses. It's a pity that Mr. Arthur focused on the drawing-up of my symptoms and their causes and this in a way that goes beyond his competence, instead of honestly informing me that he simply can't help me."

3409,"I'll say openly the object has only nice apartments the rest of the tragedy . The service is a mistake, the apartments are virtually untidy. The food in the restaurant very not tasty, when we paid attention to the staff we heard we had to not order. And one more amount for the night was very large but we knew it. Even for a cot for a 6-month-old child call 50 PLN per day it is funny. I do not recommend and never again rosevia resort . . . ."
3410,"The IChM is characterized by a high mortality rate - one in five people die from it. One third of the patients who have undergone it suffer permanent consequences such as: significant hearing impairment or deafness, amputations of squares or entire limbs as a result of tissue necrosis, in the future these may be intellectual disorders, attention deficit or learning problems, as well as seizures, hydrocephalus or damage to various organs. Experts have pointed out that in the case of sepsis it is very important to quickly diagnose and administer antibiotics - preferably within the first hour after the diagnosis is made. ""Each subsequent hour of delay in the administration of antibiotics in the case of sepsis increases mortality by 8%. "" - emphasized prof . Kuebler ."
3411,"The service very nice fact of the pros is very little the room was altogether nice and reasonably clean, unfortunately there are more cons very not comfortable bed in which you didn't go to sleep, no desirable table or at least an electric kettle. And most importantly every time you leave the room there was a problem with re-entering it which was a total failure because every time you had to go downstairs to the reception and the parking lot with which there was also a tiny problem with the gates did not read the ticket. Generally for the price I do not recommend, it is better to pay extra and have a little better conditions for this price. . ."
3412,"An ordinary person seeing someone else suffer, has a natural reflex: Help, relieve suffering, advise, do something good. The need for help is even stronger when it comes to a small child.

Mrs. Adamska sent a little suffering child crying in front of her office to the E.R. because she had no number. She didn't mind at all that she doesn't have any patients and sits alone like a peg in her office. Maybe she is a good doctor, maybe even a great one. I couldn't check. I'd rather not. If someone doesn't get the impression of a little baby crying, he shouldn't be a doctor and certainly not a pediatrician. And I'm sure I won't trust her to look after my children."

3414,"Such an entry may generate traffic that can in one way or another be monetized. Potentially the object could lose twice - traffic escapes to an unauthorized site, there is money left. If you buy a subscription, the scheme is the same, with the cost of the subscription added. The ""unauthorized"" use of content created by the hotel, as euphemistically called em, is theft. This alone should end the topic of possible cooperation with such a portal. And let us not be fooled by well-intentioned assurances . In order not to develop the topic too much, I will skip further threats, such as negative, in no way moderated opinions."

He accepted me for a cardiac surgical consultation after the impossibility of using stents. He explained to me all the pros and cons of performing coronary artery bypass grafting, even though I was only 51 years old. He wasn't performing this surgery, he was assistant dr. The Kreacher, but his team is made up of the best. I had three bypasses implanted in December 2007. Today, March 2009, I am skiing and cycling. I even play football, maybe not like I used to, but I feel great. It is exactly as Professor Bochenek told me."
3416,"It is hard to find a hotel in Corfu for less than 100 euros a day. That's why we spent one night in this hotel while travelling to Albania. Space prices and this still gave up our breakfast which cost 10 euros extra. Location of the hotel close to the harbor, from the airport on foot about 25min with suitcases handheld on collars - no problem. By the way, you can visit the coast and the accompanying beautiful views. The hotel is clean, although you can see the tooth of time. Beautiful view of the harbour, air conditioning, bathrooms a bit like those of the 90s but very clean. On the way back from Albania hooked us up in the port of Georg who took us to his house, showed the real Greece where we paid 35 euros a night and showed us restaurants and shops that have normal prices not under tourists. In this he took us to the airport for the second day and we did not have to pay anything for it. Rating for the Konstant hotel average summary of quality, price, location, amenities. In the evening, Corfu is full of bats. They are hanging from old tenement houses making loud sounds."
3417,"my first stay in ibis buget, quiet hotel, the reception is not open 24 hours a day a room quite big, comfortable bed, dormitory type room, bathroom and toilet are separate two capsules, shower installed permanently at the very top, maybe that is why, a little unpleasant smell in the capsule. As far as the location is concerned it is unfortunately a big minus, not only that the s-bahn goes more than 3o minutes from the centre, but from the s-bahn station to the hotel 40 minutes on foot, and from the nearest bus stop about 15 minutes (the bus goes rarely, at the weekend from 10 to 19 minutes, and to this the hotel is in a slight seclusion, because outside the administrative border of Berlin and you have to go past the forest). So I recommend it if you are a car."

He lectures so that the student understands (I only had algebra with him), and if you are active, i.e. you listen to what you say and sometimes you add something of your own, it is easier to understand and then on the exam. . . . .or rather """
3421,"This hotel has no fantastic location. Unfortunately, the view is blocked by the very facade of the building. For this price, I expected a much better view of the sea. But apart from the view and neglect, everything was fine. The rooms are big and modern. The service is friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out is very easy and fast."
3422,"I had the pleasure of having a lecture with this lady! I'll tell you what, he's got a big knowledge, but he can't give it ! He's often mistaken at the blackboard when doing tasks. The first one of the two wheels in my class did about 15 people for the whole group, which is more than 100 people, the second one even less. The corrective column was passed by 20 people, so the lady, walking on our hand, made one more corrective, but not for all, only for those who, according to her, showed on the corrective that they know something there. I passed 'em on the first amendment and had 'em at peace. It was nice for a student unless he got nervous: ) After all, I don't recommend why bother as others can pass without a problem! PS . From what she told us, she's retired after this year : )"
3423,"Unfortunately, I regret to say that I am dissatisfied with the visit to the doctor's. She signed up for a private visit, following her opinions after doing two pregnancy tests with results indicating pregnancy. I have never been pregnant before and she informed me about it. The doctor took an ultrasound of me and said that I couldn't see the pregnancy and couldn't tell her, after which she told me to come in two weeks. She informed me that I couldn't stand such a long time in ignorance and asked me if there were other ways to confirm it faster, and then she asked me: ""Why do you want to know that? Do you want to tell someone about it? "" I was surprised, because it is rather important information. She replied that I want to know if I have to take care of myself twice (it is probably obvious). The doctor said that the tests are often mistaken (she did two tests of different companies, so it is strange that both of them are mistaken). She got me a referral for a beta hcg blood test. The doctor informed me that if it is elevated it indicates a pregnancy, but that you should not yet be happy because it could be an ectopic pregnancy. You don't know where the pregnancy is and what it is. She was scared and shocked and came out of the office. The doctor stressed me very much and scared me. Worried about the ectopic pregnancy, she couldn't sleep at night, she cried. The next day she went to another doctor and only there she heard that she shouldn't worry because in such an early pregnancy (about 4 weeks), it is normal that you can't see anything on the ultrasound and that there is nothing that could indicate an ectopic pregnancy so early! and that there is no reason to think about it! I think that the doctor wrongly and unjustifiably scared me, instead of realizing in which week the pregnancy should already be visible and possibly if it wasn't visible you could mention the ectopic pregnancy at all. In addition, she didn't get any recommendations for nutrition, lifestyle or supplementation. No gynaecological examination during the visit, no question about the current cytology. The doctor seems to have probably stated that I am not pregnant, which did not work out. After the visit she felt terrible and felt much more insecure and afraid than before the visit . I do not recommend it."

3425,"Very good urologist. The kind, specific, devotes enough time to explaining the patient's current state of health. He prepares mentally for the procedure. During my stay in the hospital, I felt Mr. Grzegorz's commitment to improve my health. He is available for the patient. He was able to find an additional moment of time to answer my health problems. He is an energetic and well-organized man . All documents were prepared on time and contained important data about the procedure or discharge from the hospital. At the end of the treatment, a friendly conversation with precise instructions on what to do next, how to proceed in case of any problems. The patient does not feel left alone. Thank you very much for your care. My compliments to you for your competence. Tadeusz F . completely accidental patient"
3426,"People and what kind of doctor we go to and we don't pay at least 50 PLN. Unless it's public for six months. To Dr . Szczesiula in the morning you call and you go the same day. Next thing you decide on a homeopath, you have to be patient. And the majority of people who say bad opinions are 2 times they were and did not see the result because in their opinion every disease is a seven-day rhinitis and is supposed to be 100% healthy in 7 days. Then we listen to the doctor because every mistake in the diet, bad smell, etc. are recurring ailments. But if you are patient, you consistently follow the recommendations, the effect will be one hundred percent. I recommend Dr . Lucky if you have real health problems, my child has been helped by Dr. Brown. and help those who have not been helped by traditional treatment."
3427,"This is a hotel where you can rent a large, comfortable room or, for a small price, a small one. Breakfast is delicious; very varied, abundant, served with own baked goods. Lick your fingers! In the hotel you can also have a drink or buy beers of your own production (they are bottled in your presence)."

3429,"Greetings! Dr Witwiski performed two nasal surgeries, the first one was the correction of cartilage in 2012 and the full correction in 2016. The effect was unfortunately very unsatisfactory both after the first and second surgery. After the first surgery the nose was a bit shorter in truth, but after the wounds healed it took on a strange shape, there appeared thickening, the tip of the nose fell down, the nose just disfigured the face. After consultation with the doctor, I decided to have a second operation, this time a full correction. Currently, the nose has a slightly better shape, no less, however, it is far from looking bad. The bone is on the one hand unevenly sawn (the doctor's attention was drawn to it during the check-up visit - she heard that it is probably still the wound after the surgery and should heal). The unevenness has remained until today. To sum up, yes, the nose looks a bit better than before the surgery, however, after two treatments she expected a much better effect. Personally, I cannot recommend it !"
3430,"""It is important to realize that we have as many as 18 such subtypes, with only eight in human pathology. But these eight are characterized by such variability that no one is able to predict whether even in the following year or years there will not be a new mutation, which will not undergo rapid prophylaxis with a vaccine"" - emphasized prof . Górski . As he pointed out, the aggressiveness of this disease is very serious, and the increasing mobility of societies makes its occurrence much longer. Once the flu used to come to Poland at the end of February and lasted more or less until mid-April, and now influenza cases are recorded from early autumn until very late spring."
3431,"I'm a rather good doctor - but recently, when I shared a remark that another doctor ""enlightened"" me and told me what I was sick of. He heard 'em from Mrs. Lusińska, I quote; ""That doctor shouldn't talk""? ? It is very incomprehensible to me, - - because I should have just been informed about my illness \nfor example, that the attending doctor would not prescribe ""some"" medication and would make up unobtrusive things \n-. And in the hospital the disease is on the cards, the patient is informed and often, knowing what is wrong with him, he has to agree to the procedure! I think the doctor was mistaken! ! Another remark that my ailments have been curing for 18 months and no radical changes for the better. ! !"
3432,"I don't recommend it. The doctor disrespects patients. He's unprofessional. Today I was at his place in the LIM center. The lady at the reception said that the doctor was a little late (15 minutes), but he was still out of time. Two patients before me were at his place 10 minutes in total, and I entered 5 minutes before my hour. During the visit the doctor did not take me seriously, let alone my problems. He was not very specific, he stated in general terms that my problems were a result of stress and as a cure she got a leaflet that such a prominent specialist recommended me to read at home. I would just add that she waited 1 or 5 months for this visit."

3434,"A large hotel ideal for a weekend outing. Nice, large rooms, many attractions for children - aquapark, bowling, stud farm. Nice swimming pools outside the hotel. Very nice patio. Very nice area around the hotel. And the thing this hotel wins with others is the kitchen - very, very good food. Close to the center of Mikolajki. However, when going to Gołębiewski in the season or for a ""long weekend"" you have to reckon with a lot of people, some of whom may be disturbed. However, as above, if we want to take our thoughts away from work and everyday life, I can recommend this hotel."
3435,"My husband and I spent a week in this hotel. Despite the early season, the hotel was almost full. Few Poles, a lot of French guests. We got us a room on the top floor, but there is a beautiful view from each (from the sea side). From the garden - family rooms. Interesting varied meals."
3436,"I got 'em after reading positive opinions about her. Unfortunately, he was very disappointed in 'em. The details . . . Mrs. Ewa made a diagnosis even before she got acquainted with the delivered research results. I would like to point out that my condition is very serious and MRI images are very important. The doctor did not turn on any of the brought CT discs, even the last examination. In general, all the medical records were reviewed very briefly. At least on the first visit of the patient it would be advisable to spend a little more time. Apparently, time is money - some people notice this principle. I look at the watch many times, and finally I get back to my attention that the next patient should have entered 10 minutes ago. Well, it would be a good idea to cover up your earning attitude towards patients a little bit. Another issue is the level of Doctor's knowledge. Doctors sometimes do not take into account that the person coming to them - the patient - is not necessarily a complete layman. People who have been struggling with a serious illness for years, consulting with many specialists, studying many publications - often have a good knowledge of medical terminology. Evidently, Eve does not take such a fact into account. Although she is objectionable (contrary to all the other neurologists who have been with 'em!), she gives her opinions very quickly and freely. A good patient evaluation is a good history. Unfortunately, the Doctor definitely prefers to speak rather than listen. I will agree with the previous speaker, do not go to Doctor Ewa Pawlak with a case of a serious illness. Perhaps, a very light and quick way of approaching the patient is enough to analyze simple diseases. He wanted me to make it my case. For those who need really specialist advice - I advise against it!"
3437,"The hotel is located on the third floor of a tenement house at 43 Giovanni Bettolo Street. In fact, the hotel is an apartment divided into several rooms for rent. The hotel is not far from the Vatican and the Olympic Stadium. There is a grocery store, a restaurant and a fast pizzeria in the neighbourhood. The room was very small and dark, from what I noticed, the rooms from the main street are much brighter. The equipment: wardrobe (small but sufficient for a short stay), TV (several channels, did not watch 'em so I do not know exactly what), lamp, 2 bedside tables. . . modest but OK . Bathroom also in size did not knock on your knees - long but narrow. Tall people will have little room to take advantage of it. Towels of very poor quality . There is no option with food, but vending machines with coffee, tea, mineral water are available in the hall - no extra charge. People working there are very friendly and nice. The ratio of quality to price - very good."
3438,"A great hostel with a great owner! The rooms are very nice, the bathrooms are small but clean, the breakfast is tasty but the best is the roof terrace where you can drink wine and discuss with other hotel guests until late at night. The location is good if you are going to explore the city because the beach is 30 minutes away on foot or 10 minutes by bus (the stop is next to the hotel). I recommend it !"
3439,"Dr. Drzewicki led my pregnancy, which ended in a caesarean section because she had a buttock position. He set the day of birth for me almost 2 weeks before the planned date of delivery. He said it didn't matter much, and besides, he was leaving for a few weeks, so she had to decide. The birth took place without any problems, my son was also fine. She was very happy until the day she found out I had endomeriosis caused by too early delivery. Now I have to go to the surgery and remove the hematoma from the scar, but by the time I get to the menopause I have to reckon with the fact that it may come back, not to mention that I may not have any more children. Girls be careful with the caesars, don't get cut too early and for any reason."

A very impressive quality of sound from the above mentioned sources. Only after connecting to the cd player with a built-in headphone amplifier (price of the device is 2000 PLN) you can accept it but it is still not crazy. Do not buy this cheap product. It costs funny money and plays just as funny. Those typing in here the sound quality of these transducers probably didn't have any musician lessons in primary school. These one hundred and fifty flattering opinions are suitable for the garbage truck. Congratulations to the aforementioned
3442,"The hostel is tragic. We slept on the terrace and that's the only thing that saved us, because it didn't stink there. Bathrooms are very dirty with doors not locked! No deposits, no cabinets. The staff changes every two days and cannot answer the simplest questions about Istanbul. There are much better hostels in the area for the same price."
3443,"This hotel absolutely does not deserve your category. 5 stars for hotel staff only. There are tight rooms waiting for you, inside which there is an unpleasant smell reminiscent of sheep wool. If you think that the charge for accommodation is all the costs, you are wrong. On the spot you will pay for practically everything: parking, breakfast and even WIFI. Recreation area is a swimming pool that can accommodate about 4 adults and before entering you must fill out a form. Breakfast buffet is a tasty dish but not very varied for this standard. You will not find in the buffet basic products such as ketchup or mustard, poor also among fruits. After a meal you will drink your favorite coffee but unfortunately you will not taste any dough. Outside of the location, this hotel has really little to offer its guests."
3445,"I do not recommend this hotel for business trips. I ate 'em up a lot of shame. There is no restaurant in the hotel, although the page in the description is. We came from the route very hungry and quite late, the next 2 hours took us looking for a restaurant in a remote area, because there are only small bars nearby where you can not invoice after an hour. 15 . The reception desk is closed after 3 pm. 21 . The man goes upstairs and watches TV. Even though we were told that we would go to the train station for one more person for whom a room was booked, after 3 p.m., the reception is closed. After 9 p.m. nobody wanted to let us in the hotel and stay because the Lord upstairs was watching the game. Only at 9 p.m. At 11 p.m., when the game was interrupted, he picked up the intercom and came to the reception desk outraged. The Swedish table for breakfast is rather modest. Around the hotel the grass hasn't been cut long."
3446,"Location, in the very centre, very close to the square and the Dalius Salvador Musem. A hotel with crazy design. Colorful. Unique. The roof terrace of the hotel with quite a limited view. Wifi was not available in the room, the staff who knew only Spanish but could communicate; )"
3447,"The doctor is very kind, but either she has memory problems or she treats everyone in advance for the same thing. The doctor started to treat me for infertility, which she has not even diagnosed yet, she recommended taking heavy hormones and bone strengthening tablets even though I do not have a bone problem and even have ""120% of the age standard"". I'm sorry to say this, but I don't feel like the doctor's years of glory are over. . . ."
3448,"Excellent location, excellent service, great animation. Its cascade arrangement is an additional attraction. With a large swimming pool quietly and calmly, the lower floor of the pool is smaller with a bar, and next to it animation and fun. Excellent food, very varied and very nice service. The hotel is perfect for people with children and has a mini kindergarten. Wonderful views. We were there at the end of August and the beginning of September and the pace. ok. 34 - 37 degrees did not cause much trouble. This year we decided to choose also a sunshine this time on Rhodes."
3449,"The visit was timely, the doctor was nice, but he listened to me as it turned out later. . . . . .he made a bad diagnosis! In my case, the problem was an itchy rash that appeared on the forearms, legs and cleavage. The doctor after seeing it was scabies - he did not check it under the microscope, but he said with such conviction that she believed him m . He wrote out medicines for me and my partner - because he claimed that he probably got infected from me. The diagnosis was so shocking that the next day before the application of the drugs (which she bought m anyway - they were not cheap) she went to see my family doctor, who stated with conviction that it is certainly not scabies! ! The next step was to go to another dermatologist, who also confirmed with conviction that it is not scabies. . . urticaria . She got ointment for urticaria, changed her cosmetics for children and after a few days the problem disappeared. I will also add that my partner did not have any skin problems despite the fact that we were together and used the same bedding - this only confirms that the diagnosis of Dr. Ludew was wrong. I am very sorry because I was exposed to unnecessary stress, buying unnecessary medicines and wasting time."
3450,"Unfortunately, I can't agree with all the positive reviews. I've been looking for a long time for a known vascular doctor for my dad who has a knee problem, found out his knee is degenerate, waiting for the date of surgery so at a glance. Mr. Bartholomew was about 50 minutes late, the patients in the hallway were already very nervous and then the visit was rather ""fast"" because the patients are waiting for others, not that we pay 300zl for the visit with services to be slipped by the doctor who has no time for the patient. . . I don't know if it's a personal matter of the doctor's own or an isolated case that day but after reading the opinions I had completely different expectations about this visit and even if someone is late, I would have to apologize and not speed up the examination. My dad went out disgusted and is looking for a vascular surgeon on his own."

The high standard of private office and medical services, unfortunately it is located on the outskirts of the city and these are obviously paid visits, I do not remember how much. The doctor, as far as I know, does not go for home visits either."
3453,"A doctor may have experience, may have knowledge but does not respect his patients. For a private visit she arrives late, examines 10 minutes. The same with regard to the National Health Fund, she once waited 4 hours in the hospital for medical advice (interpretation of results). In addition, the doctor served me in 5 minutes. In addition, she prescribed me tablets which were supposed to improve the results of too high sugar after the curve. The pills turned out to be wrong and it was good that she didn't take them because my sugar was normal and she would only do me some harm, she could even die. Too little sugar could have led to unconsciousness and an accident. In addition, instead of treating a lack of menstruation and too high a prolactin, the doctor focuses on sugar, which, as it turned out, had nothing to do with lack of period. I do not recommend it! I won't go again!"
3454,"Due to a charming place and a beautiful Wedding Hall, we decided to organize a wedding in Sobienie. Unfortunately, 3 months before the wedding, we accidentally found out that our dream room had burned down. The director made every effort to prevent this information from reaching us. He then assured us that the room would be rebuilt for our reception in August. The director's assurances can be put between the fairy tales. The promised ""financial compensation"" we have not received until today because, according to the director's superior, ""we do not practice this kind of compensation in our hotel. The reception took place in a tent, a pardon in the ""Tent Room"" . It was too dark, after entering the tent, fruit flies flew over the tables, the bottom layer of the cake was made of Styrofoam, about which we did not know. The director washed away about. 3, and the waiters had a full range of things to do. Nothing (except potatoes) was left to eat. . . For the price of 200 PLN / person you can expect the tables to be set, but in this case we were ashamed that it is so poor. We did not save ourselves on anything, but the hotel saved us and above all our guests. Do not believe the director's assurances, he promises everyone, everything and then he will do nothing and run away. To the worst enemy I do not recommend organizing a wedding on Saturdays, because "" . . . . .no day will happen again, there are no two similar nights. . . """
3455,"Unfortunately, I'm not happy with the treatment. Despite assurances that the tooth will be perfect, you can see the difference between the filling and the tooth, and prices are not low. The enamel during treatment has been damaged, you can now see cracks on the outside of the tooth. More than a month ago I treated the tooth and still can't heal the palate that was damaged during the treatment."
3456,"Before I go to the n . t . Mr. Doctor is a few words about service in the Pleiades . I am very satisfied with the customer approach. The staff is very kind and tries to help in every way possible to make life easier for the patient. Here are the big five! ! ! As for the Doctor, he was doing an ultrasound of the hip joint of my month old daughter. He has an incredible patience with children. Despite the fact that the child during the procedure was getting on the table several times the doctor treated this fact with great forbearance. Finally, as I am a beginner daddy, he helped me to wrap my daughter in a pamper and dress her up. Of course I don't mention the Doctor's professionalism here because it is obvious. He explained everything to me, so that even a layman like me understood everything. I recommend the Pleiades to everyone - they are fine and I will go back there ."

The problem with the buttons appeared right after playing, in the meantime throwing me into the program of the mouse, so that while still playing I had no influence on the game. The mouse did not respond to the commands. I do not recommend . Why do players need a wireless mouse for 100 golds like 2x as much with a wire to have 100 times better mouse? A good wireless mouse is at least 200 zloty, not 100."

You ask him, it will help you, or he will say that ""you already know everything, why do you need analysis"". One downside is that it's quite strange to judge the wheels (some he likes less than others) and he watches over the wheels because he thinks it's better to do the wrong thing yourself than to do the right thing. What matters is your own knowledge. If you understand what is going to happen in the exercises, you can easily write the circles (you may get a few tasks from the exercises). Generally nice exercise."

In addition, there are vibrations on the steering wheel. . At the back I have a deb deb deb debris navigator and those after 25,000 km look almost like new, although I don't know if they wouldn't wear out like a passio on the front axle."
3462,"The doctor is actually very kind and cultured, but he did not give a comprehensive answer to my questions and did not explain to me many of the things she tried to ask me. The answers ""yes"" or ""no"" unfortunately did not satisfy my curiosity and left me with more questions and doubts than before the visit ."
3463,"Unfortunately, she wasn't with my little children. I think a lot of discounts encourage families with children to come here. Hence the difficulty of using the pool, the crowd, the noise and even the lack of places in the restaurant. The staff is not interested, especially the receptionists. The staff, busy with phones, staying in the other room, waited for a while to pay. A room with a view of the dumpster, morning noise from the garbage truck free of charge. From my room also the noise from the street, contrary to appearances, cars drove often. Tasty breakfasts and dinners."
3464,"The only advantage is the proximity of legoland, attractive prices for entrance tickets and swimming pool in the complex, no air conditioning and a tiny fan with 4 stars put the hotel on the blades, glass windows for the entire length of the room with a small opening window wing combined with high temperatures outside gave the feeling of being in the greenhouse! Drama ! ! ! ! Sleeping with the window open is even impossible with planes still taking off from a nearby airport. The restaurant partially compensated for the stay, full and varied meals, although paying extra for a drink to a meal with the price of a meal for children which cost 140 kroner for adults 230 kroner in combination with a fee of 1700 kroner for one night for 3 people is a slight exaggeration, attractions mainly for children. I had the impression of a masquerade, a lot of movement and milling, very friendly reception, very competent and friendly staff at the reception."
3465,"I gotta see your doctor for a headache test. She was examined and no defect was found. Despite this, the doctor prescribed me drops of ""loosening eyeballs"". The headaches were passing by for a while and it seemed to me that it was thanks to the drops, but it was a coincidence, the drops did not work in the long run. She returned me in the meantime to the doctor for the next prescription, she examined me again (I don't know why, because in a month or two nothing has really changed). The question is why she took it at all, for me it was re-examined as unnecessary spending money as paying for the prescription itself. Earlier I thought I had been thoroughly examined, however, when I was examined by another ophthalmologist, there were my eyes dripped for a better examination, the doctor did not do this at all. After that, with the opinion of the other ophthalmologist she found out that I should not use the drops that I was assigned if no eye defect was found. So with my experience, I would rather visit you than visit you."

When she asked me for help - on the card she got m it was written that in case of unsuccessful treatment I can apply for such help - it was not even a return phone. And a visit to the cheap ones does not belong to 250 PLN. I don't know what for. And it did not last an hour at all."
3471,"Some time ago, there were 'em at a consultation in Ortho-Med. They took impressions , pictures . The next visit was to discuss the treatment plan (a week later). Dear Mr. Jarosław Iwanicki invited me to his office, sat down and asked what I actually want : ] His statement sounded as if he did not see my pictures at all, he did not say anything concrete, except that in ""next week we can glue the locks"" As for discussing the treatment plan it is very ""much"" so thank you for your trouble. . . As someone wants to hear anything before the treatment (and not to find out in the course that there is some problem and it is necessary to pull out two other teeth etc) I don't think I recommend it. Though I naturally don't know what it looks like to be treated with you. Physicist risks"
3472,"Overall, the camera looks good. The advantage is the large and clear icons . The disadvantage in American is the reduced and less functional software . For the price of 250 pln you can require a menu in Polish ( it was Slovak and Hungarian ) . After all, we are a big market and not a country of the 3rd world . Disqualification of the phone was caused by an unsolvable by Nokia and Micro$ oftu engineers problem of headphone connector plug . Although the music player works well, the loose plug caused a loss of channel or both, noise and taps with every move. This is not only the problem with this model! I've encountered this drawback in 3 of my tested or used models The development of a failure-free headphone jack is beyond Nokia's capabilities and M$ oftu. It's strange that other companies can do this without any problems. Generally I do not recommend it. If someone only cares about a ringing device it is better to choose a cheaper model such as Nokia 222 ."
3473,"I really recommend 50 PLN is not an exorbitant price for such conditions: ) A little small bathroom but very nice, there could be a larger washbasin 8 less pressure: D A very nice young lady greeted us for this also mega positive: )"
3474,"It's probably nice there in the summer and the air is clean. There were 'em in the building ""B"" in December 2016, that is, not so long ago. that you can look at the fumes from the houses on the other side of the valley. When it is than atmospheric fumes from the city will cover the whole park. Once / 100 years ago there was a ban on heating houses with coal only coke. Now, after a hundred years of Polish farming there is no such order and everyone smokes what they want. The environmental protection department is at the town hall - but only is - maybe they wrap candy in silver. The rich city has a lot of income from Zieleniec but they take care of the name Zdrój . The air is fatal, the water in the taps is highly chlorinated and stinky, just like in Wrocław. For this city wishes 3, 90 PLN for one day of stay. In this city I will not even stop for a minute in the parking lot."
3475,"This is my second stay in this hotel. This time it was much better, mainly because the hotel is being renovated and the rooms are much more pleasant. Hotel: Location of the hotel is good. You can walk to the center (market square) or take the bus (on foot about 1.5 km). The hotel is clean, the reception staff is nice and friendly. I did not have any problems with the service. Room: This time I got 'em a room after renovation on the third floor. Pleasant decor, modern, clean, although there were already traces of use. Comfortable bed, pillows as well. Quite a big flat screen TV. Bathroom nice, not too big, with shower, clean, big mirror. I am generally satisfied with this room. Besides, you can find good prices when booking online. They refer to the renovated rooms, this ""caught"" promotional price is quite good - it would be better if a meal was included in this price; o ) but maybe I require too much; o )"
3476,"Slept 'em one night but I'll be back. Polite service, free wifi. Nice room with a desk to work. Comfortable bed. Fantastic breakfast choice - really worth going down for breakfast. The only downside is the lack of acceptance of Diners cards and non-local cash. The price is e.g. in EUR but cannot be paid:"
3477,"The Gillette Sensor Excel cartridges, although they were introduced to the market several years ago, can be used even today. It is becoming more and more difficult to get them, instead of them there are cartridges for Blue 3 system machines (which are interchangeable with Sensor series cartridges). I'll say yes, it's best to use a brush and aloe vera shaving cream (I recommend Palmolive Sensitive), then you don't feel the slightest irritation, even when shaving against the hair. The cartridges last for quite a long time, however, compared to Gillette Blue 3 disposables (the disposable handle, from which you can remove the three-sharpened cartridge matching the Sensor series). which can be found in promotions in supermarkets, are unprofitable."
3478,"Dr . Jacek Kałużny is a professional ! I can recommend him 100%. I have only been to your doctor's office once, but no dentist has ever determined the exact amount of cavities she has had previously. The doctor discussed with me in detail the condition of my dentition - he explained what he would do and suggested what else he should do. It started with the cleaning - a very nice lady (probably an assistant) did it very precisely, explained in turn what she was going to do next. I am very pleased. Of course, she signed up again for the same office."
3479,"Spanish hotel chain Paradores is synonymous with luxury. Here you pay from 100 euros upwards for a room, and in your hotel, which is the showcase of the group and is located right next to the famous Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela - even 280 - 400 euros. Despite the crisis, Paradores are doing well. What is your philosophy? What we do here, we do in other hotels belonging to the chain. As you know, our chain has 83 years of history. It was founded in 1928. It was founded with three objectives: to restore the historical heritage of Spain to its former glory - castles, palaces and monasteries by transforming them into hotels; secondly, to give a boost to the national economy through the development of tourism; and to revitalise lesser known or even unknown regions and places."
3480,"""The optimal temperature for our body is 20-24 degrees Celsius"" - Andrzej Kędziorski, PhD from the Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection of the University of Silesia, told PAP. How does the body cope with getting rid of excessive heat? ""Our body has no other possibilities to give away heat than through evaporation. That is why you have to drink a lot of fluids"" - said the scientist. In his opinion mineral water is the best; it can be slightly salted. On the other hand, the food should be easily digestible. It is best if there are a lot of vegetables and fruits on the menu. On hot days you should avoid alcohol. ""Drinking alcohol during hot weather is very dangerous and can lead to serious health consequences, and even death"" - specialists from the Regional Rescue Station in Warsaw warn. That is why beer consumption - often advertised as a refreshing drink - is not a good idea during hot days."
3481,"I warn all those who want to spend more than 150 PLN before this purchase. This toy is not worth the money. In my opinion, its real value is 70 - 80 PLN, but in no case 200 PLN. Before the lights, it is offered for 200 - 260 PLN . It's a WARNING price, even * * * * * * * * , making a client into a bottle. EPEE company makes us FRAJERS. Let's not suggest ourselves with pictures on the package . It looks as if it is a laser beam between which you have to skillfully pass, like in the film The Embraced. Unfortunately, it's not a laser, it's just a DISCOVERY. The sound effect is also not refined. . We are disappointed and disappointed. It's a waste of money. . I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! ! !"
3482,"He spent two nights in that hotel in November. The place has a good location in Lodz, although the hotel itself is very disappointing. The bedroom is tiny, you can hardly move around at all. There are no wardrobes, shelves or even hangers where you can hang your clothes - there were only four hooks for coats on the wall, nothing more! So he did not unpack 'em suitcase. The same goes for the bathroom - no shelves where you could put the toiletries. The staff at the reception was not very friendly. I think there was a party in some room on the same floor, so the other night I stayed almost didn't sleep a wink. Breakfast was very poor. I do not recommend this hotel."
3483,"We went with a 4-person ( 2 children aged 5 and 2 ) family through the TUI office. The hotel is located near the beach, which walking 100m to the right has a sandy beach. We were accommodated in a room on the 4th floor (only one building has them) overlooking the pool and ... . the sea, from the other rooms you cannot see. You have to go out to the balcony and look to the right but the view is great. I recommend to families with children because there is peace and quiet. Rooms are tidy, clean, daily cleaned, equipped with air conditioning, refrigerator, kettle, tableware, oven/microwave, TV (limited number of channels). There are two pools with fresh water, we liked the one near our room because of the paddling pool. We had no problem with sun loungers, no matter what time we came, there was no problem. Now the kitchen - the food we liked very much especially their vegetables, feta cheese of course, tzatziki, olives and squids. Meat dishes can be disappointing but the Greeks use generally little spice so it is not their fault, this is the kitchen. For children pizza, pasta, very good ice cream. During our stay, we were allowed to have themed dinners (Italian, barbecue, Greek) in other hotels. We decided to laugh at the Greek and on time we were picked up by a waitress from this hotel, who in the evening, the beach led us to dinner. The food was tasty except for the meat (gyros, lamb), as they wrote 'em earlier. If you are going to explore the island I recommend you to buy a trip with Mrs. Kasia, I do not remember the office but it is the first one on the right side (it is hard not to notice) encountered walking left after leaving the hotel. We decided to rent a car for 55 / day, a trip to the wreck bay and turtles. The trip to the wreck bay did not manage to get off the shore but it depends on the weather conditions, be careful here with children because people vomited and all were soaked because the water was blowing inside. In general, I recommend you to take a trip by car, go around the island and feel the climate (one day is enough), Mrs. Kasia will show you places worth seeing. I hope you will find the tips useful, we and the family were very happy with the stay and I can recommend this hotel for families."
3485,"The guesthouse boasts that children up to the age of 3 eat for free and in the meantime there was not even tableware and seating at the canteen. The playroom was closed all day long, only when there were breakfasts and lunches children could play there. The animations three times a week. Eating with the cheapest ladybug products, nothing was done, dinner was divided into portions, after lunch you had to go out to eat, for dessert you were served ladybug yoghurt or some fruit. For such a high price it is a terrible saving the guesthouse leads. The rooms are big and tidy every day. The guesthouse is located on the busiest street in Vladek, between the church, the fire brigade and not far from the station and church. The door closes so loudly that even if someone wants to, it is impossible to enter quietly at night."
3486,"The service and the hotel restaurant is at the highest level - deserved 4 stars. Very good food, nicely served with very nice service. Unfortunately the hotel itself has a very uninteresting location, far from the sea and at a very busy crossroads. Room 122 offered to us as a double room is a total failure. This type of rooms do not offer even the subordinate guesthouses. The room is tiny, cluttered, gray and burgundy; the TV set must be on the fridge because there is no other place. The only thing you can gain in this room is bruises. On the bed a one-person duvet, every night we were doing a draw who is to cover himself with it. Well, there were wooden beams in the room, then at least they nailed one hanger to them. Bathroom, that's another failure. Shower by the sherry. 70 cm, washing only in it in the position ""at attention"" (and that for slim people) . Bathroom equipment is only towels, soap and hair dryer. In a word, room 122 is beyond any category (large better rooms and better equipped rented in hotels without stars). Only the price is a 4-star hotel. I do not recommend for a longer holiday, unless lillipoputom ."
3488,"I also wanted to interject my opinion on Dr. Letkiewicz I read carefully the opinions of all his patients and decided to write something about him myself. He is a good expert because he not only cured me from prostatitis but also cured the terrible ulceration on my leg! ! where other doctors spread their hands. They treated me with various medications without success. The ulceration was terrible and huge! Today, after the treatment of Dr. L., it has decreased fivefold. I also believe that the patient's discipline and the adherence to the doctor's recommendations contributes 50% to the success of the treatment. There are those who do not do this and then resent the doctor for not curing it. I greet all those at the crossroads who do not know whether to choose him or not. I picked him out and I don't regret it."
3489,"Hotel, has no hotel status, is only a holiday home / guesthouse Nice building, makes a positive impression right after entering the reception. The wellness area does not impress, there is a swimming pool but very small, a paddling pool with two saunas and a heavily damaged Jakuzzi. The water in the pool could be warmer. The bowling alley is very badly damaged, children are trampling on it. Eating ok . Something nice for everyone. The rooms are very dilapidated, the standard one is very small, the bathroom is quite big, the big room differs only in wallpaper, the walls have not seen the paint for a long time, in all rooms there are balconies. There is an elevator in the building, parking is free. The access to the hotel is poorly marked on the main street, last ok. 200 m. You have to drive down a dirt road, bumpy, rocky, so you can get lost for the first time. Stay August 2012"
3491,"I highly recommend. This is my next visit to Poznan . And as usual Ibis Poznan Old Town did not disappoint . I always use the services of this hotel . A hotel with a great location . Snidanie: never before in hotels of this standard have I met with such a SMACK breakfast very large selection of products for everyone will find something for everyone. Very nice and professional service at breakfasts nice atmosphere in the restaurant. I recommend to everyone who visits Poznan, I will certainly return there."
3492,"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by the drug. Żminkowski Marek . He did not warn me before the kidney ultrasound camera examination that he is not able to give me a photographic image of the kidney condition because the camera does not perform this function. And the picture is necessary to be able to compare in the next examination whether there is progress in treatment [ kidney stones ] . Before the examination the medicine . M . Żminkowski did not make me aware of it ."
3493,He was em in this hotel 10 nights he does not meet the expectations of the hotel rooms without a shower on the balconies people smoke cigarettes body smoke comes into the rooms bed linen is exchanged once for a stay cleaning very miserable Maintanance bathrooms below criticism in spite of reports at the reception desk nobody reacts repair overflowing shower cubicle and fungus around the bottom of the cabin carpet stained the only advantage is nice staff
3495,"Unfortunately, I belong to a group of people who are unhappy with the effect of the nose surgery which Marta performed 2 years ago: / / / The fact that Marta is a very nice person is not a doubt, but as a good plastic surgeon I cannot recommend her. . She only wanted me to have a straight nose (she had a curved septum) - is that so much? Not only that the nose is still crooked, that in conversation with strangers to make a good impression I set myself up in profile, but also since the surgery I have 2 quite large and visible under the light ( what's the worst!) thickening in the middle of the nose : ( ( ( ( P . Marta claimed that it will come down, that it is probably a place at the seams, but unfortunately it has already been 2 years and zero improvement ; ( ( ( ( ) Every day when I look in the mirror I want to cry . She spent 8 thousand zloty, which was not easy for me to earn, to make my nose look worse than before the operation. If only she could (she had something to do with it) she would have fixed it for me, but certainly not for Martha. ."
3496,"Today was 'em at the doctor's for the third time and I'm not complaining. This time, he dislocated em kneecap, got 'em referral for a procedure, stabilizer for nfz etc . The last time was 'em with tendonitis, although it still hurts, but I can move my hand, and I couldn't move 'em. It may not be one of the nicest people, but if somebody has gone on such a long wandering tour of doctors as I do, they get used to the bizarre doctors' behaviour and are more interested in helping them than in chatting over coffee. There are certainly better orthopaedists, but so far I've only come across the worse ones (we are talking about nfz). Compared to the doctor from the Joanits, who 5 years ago after the dislocation did not even look at his leg, and when asked if it could happen again, he answered that I will find out how I will dislocate again, Dr. . The aspirator is golden."
3497,"The first impression is great, but then after ironing a heap of things: The iron iron irons very well only thanks to the evaporator and in fact you don't have to iron on the other side, but when you turn it off, it doesn't do it so well, and then you have to get tired. When ironing, the steam power decreases minimally, then again normal power and so on, over and over again, I don't know if it's related to the heating up of the iron, or if the steamer works like that. The hose between the steamer and the iron is definitely too short when it is plugged into the aerial from the board, which makes it impossible to place the iron on a table next to the board, because it can cause pulling the iron and as a result its fall. It seems to me that it could buy me cheaper by 200 - 300 PLN of the same or another company with a steam output of 120 g / min and it would have the same effect, even I am sure of it. So I don't think it's worth the price. I hope, though, that comes a long time. A board while a revelation, this is my 4th board but I think it will last a very long time."
3498,"It was my first stay at the hotel ""Krasicki"" and I must say that I have not yet managed to leave any place with such regret. The quality of food, the culture of service, the class of the hotel, the intimate but very stylish spa. There is also a room with a view of the castle courtyard and the restored baroque part of the building. I recommend it, but not too much, because I still want to find a place for myself there one day, and I'm afraid that now everyone will throw themselves at this beautiful object! ; ) Jokes, jokes - come, enjoy!"
3499,"A good hotel, located close to the station and the city centre, we were close to everywhere. The rooms were ok, clean, as we entered the hotel there was a very nice smell. In the bathroom cosmetics with an interesting, original scent. Comfortable beds. The fitness room was available but unfortunately as for me it was too modest and tight for me to use it. The view from the window was poor (on the inside of the hotel). The parking in front of the hotel was actually small. The hotel is surely distinguished by a very nice, helpful and smiling staff (but it gives an additional point in the overall score from 3 to 4 points)."
3500,"Dr. Hadacz has been able to reach me through this portal. Already on her first visit the doctor captured me with her care, forbearance and patience with which she explained everything that happened to me. In general, on that first day she left me with a referral to the Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital, because she started to bleed and miscarried my first pregnancy. Even though she wasn't a patient of mine so far, Mrs. Dr. took care of me both in the ward and then when she left the ward. No wonder that the next pregnancy was led by Dr. Hadacz. It was thanks to her that I quickly found out that I had pregnancy cholestasis. Fortunately, the disease quickly detected and then constantly monitored did not harm our baby. I must add here that Dr. Hadacz was irreplaceable during those 9 months. She was always able to call her and ask her about things that I had doubts about, especially when it turned out that the results just received were far above normal. Besides, she has a great sense of humor and she and her husband were always in a good mood. At the end of the pregnancy cholestasis was particularly bad and I was admitted to the hospital, of course, to the Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital. On October 2, 2017, thanks to Mrs. Dr. who made the cut herself, our beautiful and healthy daughter Kasia was born (and there were concerns about whether everything is okay because of the cholestasis). I must also add that despite the workload, the next day after the birth, Mrs. Dr. visited me and my daughter in the ward and interested in what is with us, which was a very nice gesture. As for the cut, I must also add that thanks to the presence of Mrs. Dr. during the CC she felt safe because she knew I was in good hands ☺ . All of this made me recommend Dr. Hadacz to everyone with a clear heart because on the one hand he is a very good specialist and on the other hand he is a wonderful and kind man. Marlena"
3501,"Unfortunately, in my case, the doctor's effectiveness opinions didn't work out. I came with an abscess on a cannula that was not cut, but I was sent back with an antibiotic that gives nothing. . . Despite the fact that the doctor is nice, my leg will not stand in this office."
3502,"I don't know where this man got a doctor from, I think, Low Meadows. It is not worth going to the lectures because he is a script on the board. He's lost his way in tasks . Generally a guy sucks."
3503,"In the hotel you can eat deliciously. Children can be left with the animators. The minus is a loud mini disco, where the animators speak through the microphone and play music loudly. She didn't notice that they have water for the children in the playroom, which is a must for me. There is a separate place for smaller children for amphibians. The animators are not too happy there and their activity starts and ends with a ""good morning"". As for the hotel itself in my life I have not met with cobwebs in the hotel 4 * for me only food (also the restaurant on the 4th floor) and the location of the hotel deserves 4 * . In room 229, which occupied us is a mess. Dirty chairs, carpet and a multitude of cobwebs. When she asked me to clean the cobwebs the lady limited herself to a cobweb on the ceiling. The ladies forgot to clean the balcony. Not only from the cobwebs, but they left the table as they found it. The child poured juice on the bedding and unfortunately they did not change it for 4 days. We were in a motel for 2 weeks and we met some holy people there. Under this execution it is an exceptional hotel. For such a price you can try to get better cleaners. Generally a hotel with mice coming up and needing renovation."
3504,"The hotel is located in the Muranów district, close to the New Town, a little further to the Old Town. In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are tram and bus lines, which can get to all major places in the capital. The Gdansk Station and the metro station of the same name are just a 10 minute walk away. As far as the hotel is concerned, this particular Ibis is already old, you can see it especially by the state of the bathrooms and equipment of the rooms. The lobby and the bar scene are very positive, and you can see that these places have recently been completely rearranged. Very nice and helpful service."
3505,"""Thrombotic-embolic complications are the pathogenic basis in patients with deep vein thrombosis and consequently pulmonary embolism. In patients with atrial fibrillation, thrombi formation occurs in the atrial ear. They are very similar in structure - the essential element of such a thrombus is fibrin. Antithrombotic treatment consists in inhibiting the formation of this fibrin. Both the structure of the thrombus and the method of therapy - antithrombotic treatment integrates these two different entities: venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation"" - explains Prof. Tomkowski . The life-threatening effect of atrial fibrillation is ischemic stroke, which in Poland affects an average of 65 - 70 thousand people annually. It is the third most common cause of death and at the same time the most common cause of disability in adults. Even 53% of survivors become partially or completely dependent on others."
3507,"This hotel is a ruin, a double room cost 94 €. . . . .it was, small, dark, scandalous bathroom! Black moulds on the joints between 30 years old tiles and a simple canalisation! After the intervention at the reception desk, I was changed to a larger room, without any stench, but with strange furniture, an old small TV set and the bathroom was lit up! ! I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO AVOID IT! !"
3509,"I don't recommend it. No comment on the competence of this doctor. However, he is brazen and arrogant towards the patient - he humiliates and judges his beauty (""Do you think I feel like looking at your ""beautiful"" mouth?""), intelligence (""Light beats from you!"") or ability to read (""Can you read?"") . He also throws a biting bite to the answer that the patient does not remember how to apply a given medicine (""Well, let's remind a colleague . . . "" "" with an ironic tone) because he has never heard or seen it, and at the clinic the nurses did not instruct the patient on the first visit. Moreover, it is expressed in vulgar language - it uses various phrases containing a word meaning a known part of the body for 4 letters . In the case of a normal doctor, the breath check is carried out after being politely instructed to the patient. In Dr. Sankowski's case the patient has to read his thoughts (it is not known whether he wants to check his nose or mouth because his hand cannot hold the torch without shaking). But once he gives the command, he is brazenly (Open your mouth! Get rid of that tongue!). This specialist has problems with empathy, contact with patients and confessing to a mistake. I strongly advise against visiting him, unless one of you is able to endure an hour of humiliation and have a spoiled humor for the rest of the day."
3510,"Dr hab . Małgorzata Dorobek from the Institute of Medicine assessed that the current methods of stroke treatment are imperfect and insufficient. Thrombolysis (i.e. pharmacological dissolution of the thrombus that blocked the blood supply artery to the brain) or thrombectomy (i.e. mechanical removal of the thrombus from the cerebral artery) can be applied to approx. The thrombectomy (i.e. the mechanical removal of a thrombectomy from the cerebral artery) can be used up to approx. 4, 5 and up to 6 hours after the stroke. ""Therefore, the percentage of patients who can benefit from this treatment is small"", the researcher noted. According to her, the hope for patients after a stroke may be regenerative medicine, which offers therapies to stimulate tissue and cell repair. It gives a chance to increase the percentage of patients who will benefit from stroke treatment. Currently, scientists associate high hopes with so-called mesenchymal stem cells (it can be obtained from adult tissues, including bone marrow, but also from tissues such as the placenta and even umbilical cord blood)."
3511,"The modernization of public space in the Novotel Gdańsk Marina Hotel has been completed. The lobby, reception and bar have gained a modern character in line with the current requirements of the Novotel brand and trends in interior design. According to them, the lobby is ""the heart of the hotel"", where guests can hold business and informal meetings, have a free meal, work on a laptop or read a newspaper. The renewed lobby gives a sense of cosiness thanks to the combination of orange and azure colours. The lighting of the walls and the ceiling has also been taken care of. A distinguishing feature, as well as an interesting element of the whole decoration are bookcases placed in the central place, forming a mini library."
3512,"Hello. We were at this hotel with the children in December 2016. We liked it very much. The hotel is clean, I do not know why others write that there are cockroaches in the food - it did not happen to us. They did not even walk on the floor. Located at the airport, so the landing planes can be seen every few minutes. The weather is great! ! Sunshine in an hour. 11 - 16 is baking sharply, so we came back tanned.) We had our own car so we visited a lot, and there is much to see. Beautiful landscape, volcanoes resemble the Moon or Mars. As far as eating is concerned it's almost the same every day, sometimes something new has appeared. But generally it can be. Nice service. Animations for children a little late because only at 20:30. But children are very happy especially with the mascot "" Tapi "" ...didn't want to go home. The animators were great. To sum up, we were all very happy and happy to be on the island to stay: )"
3513,"I felt very strange all the time. Mr. Bartkowiak was not able to determine what was happening to me, he sent me to an examination which, according to two other laryngologists, was completely unnecessary. I have very mixed feelings about this visit. The advantage is that he wrote me an L4 and a prescription for the medicine I was taking."
3514,The doctor is really good. She gave my husband an injection to help immediately. The truth is that there are always dissatisfied patients with every doctor. Remember doctors are not ghosts to know everything at once. The only downside is the nature of the handwriting - you can't read : )
3515,"This doctor is doing miracles! ~ 10 years I didn't go to the dentist because I was scared and the doctor made the treatment of the teeth pleasant. That's what Dr. Jarowiecka did with my tooth is a miracle. If it wasn't for her, she wouldn't have had a tooth and she saved and rebuilt, although I had 10% of the tooth. She's polite, deleterious, she knows what to do. The other doctors I've been removed from the hospital wanted me to have a tooth. And now I'm enjoying a wonderful smile.) I recommend it, says the person who was afraid of the dentist...)"
3516,"The case is not without flaws, it is worth its price - I needed a relatively low case, with buttons at the front, power supply at the bottom, space for cables behind the motherboard and tool-free installation and all this is fulfilled. It was vibrating a little bit, so I put a strain on it with bituminous mats. Somehow it somehow fit em to the German Raijiancec Tisis (it was a bit difficult to connect the power supply to the fans because of the lack of space between the cooling and the upper wall). I had to stick a piece of felt on the windmills because they touched the wall and the vibrations were moving. The temperatures i7 4770s under load oscillate around 65 degrees, so it's quite warm for such grazed cooling."
3517,"Programming languages , TPI , PEA Evaluation: I recommend [ / b ] The knowledge of programming is enormous and most importantly he can pass it on. An additional advantage is that it allows you to pass the subject externally, which is connected with a more ambitious problem to be programmed. There are no problems with passing, and if someone deserves it, even 5 or 5 will get it! ! !"
3518,"Dirty room, dirty carpet, cobwebs on the ceilings, dead moths in the blinds. Towels quality below rags to floor. Breakfast is very poor: coffee is hopeless - like cereals, no eggs - only cold sausages and melted cheese, sausages and flakes. WE STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST IT."
3519,"After my first visit I have a very good impression. Despite the great fear of the dentist's institution, the atmosphere in the office relaxed me. The doctor and his assistant were very delicate. The treatment plan was also discussed in great detail. I will write more when more is done, but for now everything looks good."
3520,"It was a very nice hotel, until last year. In 2016, an all-night pub developed in a neighbouring tenement house directly adjacent to the hotel. The summer garden, which is practically under the windows of the Atelier, is particularly cumbersome. Screams and loud laughter of drunken customers prevent the night's rest. The pub staff approves of the whole situation without reacting to requests for an invitation after an hour. The pub staff approves of the whole situation without reacting to requests for an invitation after 10 p.m., or to inconvenient guests to the restaurant interior. An additional ""attraction"" is the stench of a barbecue burning right under the windows."
3521,"As far as the procedure itself is concerned, it was not a pleasant one and the scar is bigger than the one I thought it would be (of course, after consultation with the Doctor), but in this respect I have nothing to reproach the Doctor, the wound has healed and there were no complications. As for the approach to the patient, well . . . . It makes no sense to set a price range for the treatment, especially if the amount of money from the upper limit is immediately dictated during the visit. Moreover, for each change of the dressing I had to pay additionally - 140 PLN / change (there were several changes), even though the change itself lasted maybe 1 minute and after reaching home the dressing simply fell off. It was all the more strange to me that when I was doing various treatments that I had to do in other surgeries, the change of dressing is simply included in the price of the treatment, and this one at the doctor's, I stress again, was not low. The sympathetic approach of the doctor to the patient is also different, I just did not experience any sympathy. And the last issue, I was supposed to appear at the follow-up visit (also paid), she called me to ask if there are already results of the histopathological examination. It turned out that they were not there. Therefore, she asked me to postpone the visit to the date when the results are already there - she wanted to save her time and she did not want me to pay double the cost of the visit. After 20 minutes, she answered my phone and it turned out that the results, however, are, it was a little strange to me, but she did not go into this issue anymore. The visit itself lasted maybe 2 minutes, it did not take place in the doctor's office, but standing up! in the room where the dressing was changed."
3522,"The room may not have been bad and not even so terrible, but the food was nasty, the bread was not once fresh spoiled toaster, coffee and tea in jugs already made, sometimes spoiled milk they gave, vegetables and fruit unfortunately almost shaved, the staff may be, although the cooks very unpleasant, I do not recommend this hotel."
3523,"Dietician and doctor Anna Senderska said that the average person needs ok . 500 mg of omega - 3 a day to meet the need for these compounds. This means that we should eat about half a kilo of fish per week. However, people with chronic diseases - cardiovascular or neurodegenerative diseases - should provide themselves up to 2 grams of omega-3 every day. ""This would require a significant change in the dietary behaviour of Poles and an increase in the consumption of oily sea fish. However, as this may be unrealistic in European recommendations, dietary supplements with these fatty acids are allowed - said Professor Mamcarz . As he pointed out, many doctors are sceptical about this because research has shown that there are no health benefits from taking vitamin preparations."
3524,"I advise you not to visit. Doctor assessing the condition of my skin (she went with acne on my face) did not get up behind the desks. She did not see the changes, very poorly conducted interview. She recommended the use of antibiotics (which of course proved to be ineffective). The fact that Dr. Lesiak prescribed the wrong drugs is not surprising, because how could she know which drug would be effective (she did not look like a fairy). It is obvious that the decision on treatment must be preceded by appropriate examinations. After a visit to another specialist dermatologist and a smear test from the pustule I was chosen the right treatment. The consultation with Dr Lesiak turned out to be a complete mistake (waste of time and money). In addition, very little contact person ."
3525,"The product is completely useless. Practical range - several meters. Any walls along the way practically block communication . I was thinking that I would be able to use a monitor in the bedroom (no range at all, distance of about 20 meters through two walls). As such, it works only by standing in the window ( line of sight ) 13 meters from the gate. I will also add that you need to have a gentle mind to combine the function of opening the gate and turning off the device in one (difficult to find) button placed on the side of the box. Considering that the range is weak at all, wanting to make sure that I actually open the gate, I reflexively hold the button for too long and turn off the device. Very funny. A few more of these episodes and I'll smash it against the floor."
3526,"I believe that this is a doctor with a lot of knowledge and experience. After his first visit, on which he interviewed me in detail, he had my hormones tested and diagnosed my case immediately after the results. I was very impressed because many of the doctors before him didn't even take care that my problems were a result of the disease and excess of male hormones, and my six months late menstruation is ""a kind of a surprise"". that no one has ever taken a serious interest in before. Dr . Rabijewski answers the questions asked by the patient and I personally feel that he is involved in the case, although I guess my case is one of the easiest in the world. As for the allegation that it's ""gbur"" I completely disagree. He is a cheerful, nice, although really specific man (in a positive sense). But I just like those ""living in my world"". His world, absolutely does not affect negatively the work and diagnostics. I strongly recommend it! Do not be alienated by the first impression and go on another visit and you will be satisfied."
3527,"I recommend that you take an active rest. Swimming pool, saunas, spa. Small gym . And very tasty cuisine. And all at a good price. I recommend to all who are looking for peace and quiet near Krakow. A very nice weekend spent with his wife and without children (although probably they would have fun here too)."
3528,"The doctor is very kind, but the recommendation to drink water for 150 PLN I think she would have prescribed me for free. Other recommendations also involve high, additional costs and quite unconventional. If you have a lot of time and money - I recommend . Therapy can bring improvement, but a good family member will say the same thing within the NFZ and in my case - he said, but I was unbelieving, so she paid me to confirm. It calmed me down and I will continue to recommend myself."
3529,"Pretty, original, eye-catching and that's where its advantages end, because it broke down literally after a few days of use. . . She didn't listen to her colleague, to whom the same thing happened and bought a mouse. After a few days, the connection started to fail, and she would unplug and connect even though she did not even touch the usb input. A few more days she kept up with it, improving the cable every now and then and trying to set it up so that it would finally connect for good, nothing of it, not much of it, still the right button broke down, it does not work. . . Complete flap, don't buy it: / /"
3530,"One night during a long weekend. A triple room, even a large one, but because of the column (pillar) standing in the middle of the room the space could not be used well. Beds are pressed into corners, with poor access, small and not very comfortable. The room is equipped with a fridge, but empty. No information about hotel services. Channels in TV - only standard. I liked the set of coffee / tea cups - very aesthetic. Bathroom for the disabled, which is not a disadvantage - however, black from the humidity of the fugue is already a disadvantage. Breakfast is very good, a big choice, no madness. The staff did not keep up with the filling up of the buffet, so basically there was always something missing. Large parking lot - additionally paid (18 PLN per day). Location good - 10 minutes on foot from the old town."
3531,"I publish the latest photos of the hotel room. ATTENTION to the quality system Krakow hotel, at 35 Conrada Street. Supposedly a 3-star hotel. The photos, although it is late, were sent by my guests who checked in at the hotel - as usual with three stars. Dirt, shit and syphilis. . . . .they did not sanctify something similar in their lives. An interesting fact is that the presented photos are pictures of a single room. The second curiosity is that I have a paid reservation in this hotel for the next day (large reservation - 7 rooms in total), although the time is late (and immediately wanted to move guests to another hotel) in the morning we move out of such offensive conditions. I am submitting the case to the Consumer Ombudsman and the Polish Hotel Association. I will not give up the case. All in all, I have been fooled by the fraudsters for over 1500 PLN. . . . . .and I wish you a nice night, but certainly not in this hotel, on the signboard should have the inscription ""PS SECURITY"" instead of these ""stars"". She must have pressed one star (she couldn't publish it) and it should be ZERO! ! ! ! ! !"
3532,"The kettle looks very nice. As for the heating function, I never used 'em, so I won't say anything. The beep is loud, but in the case of the house, you can hear it from every level, and that's a plus. It's not as big a problem as others describe it, but clearly produced for people with poor hearing. The problem is that it leaks after a few years of use. Specifically, it lasted for two years and the constant stains of water on the kettle stand and kitchen worktop forced me to throw it away. As for this price, it is a weak product."
3533,"Yesterday, I had the doubtful pleasure of dealing with the Doctor, a paid visit to the Medicine in Krakow, the Doctor sold every question, rude, poor quality service equipment, I didn't learn much, every word has to be pulled out, the most important thing for him was whether I had tanned the examination before! ! ! ! A big disappointment."
3534,"Unfortunately, the facility does not meet the expectations, especially when it comes to price/quality relations. In the rooms we found stained carpets and curtains, doors and tiles in the bathroom and hair and dust-covered hairdryer, the toilet was also not 100% clean. The ladies at the reception offered a larger room for the same price, but it was even worse there. . . The surroundings of the hotel were lovely, but so what? Everywhere papers and in the canal reaching one lake - garbage (sacks, beer cans) . You can see that the management of the hotel is failing. The small plus for efforts - a lot of attractions and as far as breakfast is concerned."
3535,"When she called me to find out the price for me and my 5 year old daughter, I was informed that you can use the mini spa and sauna in the resort. The prices seemed pretty high to me but there was to be a room for children and bowling so she agreed. Unfortunately, it so happened that the day she came to the resort she fell ill and had a fairly high fever. She came down to dinner with the child and asked me if, as an exception, it would be possible to bring the child's dinner to the room because I have a high fever and she wanted me to go to bed. The waitress said that they do not do such things. . . . .but at the end of lunch she came up to say that if there wasn't much traffic, she could bring something for the little one. . . After two days, the fever had passed and she wanted to take advantage of the ""attractions"" of the resort. She decided that I would go with the baby to the spa. Unfortunately, the inscription on the entrance clearly indicated that only adults can use it. In that case I couldn't do it because I didn't have anything to do with 5 years old. The lady who informed me on the phone knew that I was with a small child (even if the price for a child up to 10 years old is different) so I do not know why she informed me about the possibilities of using places where it is forbidden to enter with a child - because what would she have to do with a 5-year-old boy - leave him alone in the room? ? ) . There was also an option to leave the child in the playroom. . but it was closed because they exchanged something so you could not use it. So she went to play bowling. . . .and bad luck here. Some lady threw a bullet in such a way that the system hung up and it was impossible to play. We went back to the room. My daughter got sick the other day - she got a very high fever at night so she decided to go home. When paying the dues I was counted 50% for the days when I wasn't there (when she arrived she told me that I would stay until Sunday and on Wednesday I was leaving because of my daughter's illness). So for a few days she had to pay me even though I was not physically there. Because it is so in the regulations (which, of course, nobody showed me, supposedly hanging by the entrance). I also make no secret that it upset me. Because if the hotel did not fulfill that the spa, bowling or a room for a toddler, somehow they did not lower the price of the room but they counted for the days when I was not there. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! ! Because I think it is a fraud!"
3536,"Course : Engineering Geodesy I and II Simply a holy man . If every lecturer was like that. . . The lectures are conducted in a very interesting way. He often uses interludes in the form of jokes and anecdotes from his studies. During one of his classes he showed us his holiday photos. With credit, there is no problem at all. After the second semester there was to be a year-round exam. Eventually, the professor did not ask anyone, and the grades were given based on the exercises. There is really nothing to fear."
3537,"The name of the network speaks for itself. The chain belongs to the world's top hotels. From the moment you enter a hotel, you feel you are an entity and not an intruder here. Elegance, culture and discretion. I recommend brunch - the price is not exorbitant and the dishes perfectly. There is nothing to write about the quality of rooms - typical 5-star standard. I recommend"
3538,"Perfect location . Close to the Rijskmuseum . Quiet street . We had room 19 overlooking the garden. Green, the garden is home to parrots that fly freely: ) Enough room. Two beds, very soft but comfortable. In the bathroom, shower and bathtub. Breakfast very tasty. Weddings, cheeses, tomatoes, cucumber, flakes, fruit, hot tubs, toasted bread. The service is very nice and helpful. We got maps of Amsterdam. Luggage room at guests' disposal. I recommend: )"
3539,"A hotel in a good location if it is considered as a stopover during a longer journey. The location of hotel rooms opposite the fitness rooms is a misunderstanding. Unless someone likes the noise and smell of sweat.) . To get to the room we have to go through the restaurant (the stairs are in the middle of the premises) and go through the gym and fitness reception. This causes great discomfort. As for the room itself: a double comfortable bed, you can say that the room was quite decent. Bathroom was cool, but we had a whirlpool bath and when after a whole day on our feet the bride and groom felt like having a relaxing bath it unfortunately flooded the whole bathroom. . . Not very nice service - I don't like it when someone gives the impression that they are doing me a favor, that they have to serve me. Mr. Parkingowy thought that I would shoot, constant questions at the entrance and exit whether she has already regulated the parking lot (and it was paid at once) and saying that you have to be careful here because they draw cars. . . And you also liked to sleep and the horn doesn't wake him up, you have to get out of the car and go to the booth, and try to wake him up somehow. . . Breakfast is ok, but be careful - if you want scrambled eggs or sausages you have to order from the staff (we realized after breakfast;)) . I do not recommend "" hotel "" Greetings"
3540,"The accommodation was ordered by phone. After quite critical opinions, he didn't expect me to be even worse. At the entrance the owner blocked 500 PLN on the card . After 2 days of accommodation and rather unsophisticated food, the bill went up to over 750 zł. Beer poured in chalices of 330 ml and counted as 0. 5 . It is necessary to add the lack of heating in micro rooms where time stopped somewhere in the first half of the 1990s. Bathroom without hot water and the smell of sewage system free of charge . Parking not closed for the night . In the rooms from the street you can clearly hear the road passing by . Generally drama . I recommend to lovers of extreme experiences ."
3541,"And this vacation decided to go with my husband and my children to Kos Island. After persuading my friends, we chose the summer palace hotel. Beautiful view from the room, delicious food. But I wanted to pay special attention to the person who made our stay more pleasant. Lea, the French animator is extremely warm, helpful and kind person. Always smiling and joyful. Our children loved her from day one. Xavier and David were very funny, thanks to them my husband had something to do during the holidays. Positive people and positive memories will remain in our memory forever. I think that such an animation team deserves a 5 * rating and I would love to see her return to this place because of them! Greetings : )"
3542,"Hello, we were with the family 10 days in Cyprotel Filaraki . We liked very much the children had a lot of attractions practically all the time playing alone. . . .the food was delicious . Maybe a small minus the views around. . . Ruins as if people 100 years ago escaped. However, 5 km away (taxi) was already starting to start, I recommend families with children something cool."
3543,"10 years ago, the visit to your doctor lasted a minute. He asked me to chisel my teeth and then prescribe me a medicine that is given to women with nipple cancer. The visit was 150 PLN, the medicine that went to the basket of 340 PLN. No research, no interview, no questions. The reason for my bad mood turned out to be the beginning of depression. Thyroid hormones in perfect order. Sounds unlikely even for me."
3544,"I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ! I came to Luke after a car accident with a twisted cervical section of the spine. At first I could barely turn my head to the left, after a few treatments the pain stopped and if it wasn't for the memory, I probably wouldn't have known anything about the accident: ) At any time he has time to talk, intervenes quickly and is willing to help. During one spinal surgery I complained about the pain in my groin, Luke immediately took care of it. He can diagnose the problem well, if I had listened to him, he would have saved me 400 PLN which I spent on unnecessary MRI. It turned out that the adductor muscle ruptured (and not as the doctor suspected - a hernia), and the help offered by Luke in the form of manual and physiotherapeutic treatments brought the effect after a week. In short, he got himself a doctor for the future and I also recommend him to you if you ever have a problem with your spine or muscles."
3545,"It's a mess. A nightmarish hotel that was the biggest disappointment of the holiday. The photos on the hotel's website are a lie. Tiles fall off at the pool, and its location (surrounded from 3 sides by the walls of the hotel) makes the sun reach there around noon, and the pool area quickly enters the ""shadow trail"". The pool bar is cleaned probably once a season. Snacks in this bar offered in all-inclusive option smells at least troublesome, alcohols of poor quality and dubious provenance. Animations and the hotel bar are a misunderstanding. The hotel itself is located in the ""less representative"" part of town. The only plus 15 minutes on foot to the beach. The food was the biggest failure. - No local delicacies - French fries and old rice, weird sauces and stews, fatty, heavy, unhealthy - Canned fruit and fruit salads! - Watermelons cut with a knife from onion ! - Old, black bananas - Juices from boxes of bad quality - Cola and alcohols for meals (wine, beer, sangria) diluted! - Noisy service, not particularly nice. Room and bathroom - large, but the years of splendor are long gone. The furniture is old, dirty, worn out. - Internet, swimming pool towels - additionally paid - early check out - in the case of all-day trips there is no dry take-out lunch - a small shower in a bathtub so constructed that the bathroom is flooded with water - the staff pretends to clean up to top it all, on the day of departure, in the bathroom at the reception desk we found a dead cockroach!"
3546,"Beautiful view of the Tatra Mountains, I recommend taking a photo. God forbid to enter the restaurant. We had a family dinner at the bar empty, we waited 2 hours for the order. What came was not suitable for eating. Everything was either burnt or dry. The hit was when the waitress served trout claiming it was a sturgeon. Never in my life will my leg be there again."
3547,"Hello everyone , We visited the hotel with an idea for a romantic weekend for two. We have very mixed feelings about the visit. The hotel is beautifully situated, in a quiet and peaceful place in the style of Irena Eris Dylewskie Hills (as someone was) He would even tell me that the concept itself is a copy of this top hotel. The hotel looks beautifully from the outside as well as the hotel area. Now I will start with the downsides: Rooms (in a very original style with handmade furniture, which are the only advantage of the room, Well, there can be a view from the window, unfortunately, a very weak bathroom, dirty, tiny TV in the room) Restaurant (chos at breakfast, which does not delight, restaurant anyway, rather adapted to the wedding guests than the individual client) Pluses: Spa (I recommend to everyone, a lot of massages, climate and decoration as well as a large selection of saunas) In my opinion, the potential of the hotel is not exploited, I guess it's just a matter of managing the facility because the location and the facility itself - wonderfully. A big plus for the Spa Prices for the night propose to reduce to Max 250 PLN or take care of a decent bathroom renovation, cleaning and replacement of TV sets Greetings"
3548,"I also recommend it, a great nice guy. the classes are interesting and I'll probably sign up for them one day.]"
3549,"""We want the Polish medical biotechnology sector to be one of the strongest in Europe in 10 years' time,"" said Łukasz Szumowski, Deputy Minister of Science and Higher Education. - We need this sector because it is one of the fastest growing areas of scientific research today. In many countries it is also an increasingly important area of the economy, as biotechnology is entering into various areas. In order to be able to think about designing Polish medicines at all, we need to have very good basic research, also in the area of cellular biology"" - he stressed . The Institute of Medical Biotechnology (IB - Med), whose concept was presented at the end of December by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, is to support Polish scientists in conducting this research. According to their announcement, the new institution will invest half a billion zlotys in research conducted in Poland on the creation of new drug molecules."
3550,"A nice place for a quiet stay without any fountains, you need to get lazy this is just such a place, a little out of the way but if you take care of the pleasures for yourself then you can really rest, clear your head and go back to normal duties. If you like to swim and lazy up on the beach then this is what you will find! The water is great, the beach is so nice and pleasant. You go very well. Rooms without revelation but enough to sleep well."
3551,"""The data published in the world show that the problem of anaphylaxis is growing. In the last 10-15 years the number of its cases has increased 5 - cio and even 7 - times,"" said Dr. Raciborski . European data indicate that one in 300 people has experienced or will experience anaphylactic shock in the past. According to the data presented in the latest report, which was created using the registers of the National Health Fund (NFZ), the number of people who received medical services due to anaphylactic reaction has also increased in Poland in the last few years. In 2015, for example, the number of patients after a foodborne anaphylactic shock was almost three times higher than in 2008."
3552,"Small rooms, but beds ( bunk beds ) comfortable - you can sleep : - ) The ideal place to sleep after tasting the city attractions. Bathroom is clean and quite spacious. The staff (hotel reception) is very nice and friendly. Quiet, quiet, great location on the island - a few, several minutes walk to the market square and other interesting places. The hotel paid car park (39 zł / day) can be let go for free parking spaces in front of the entrance (if there is space). I recommend."
3553,"Hopeless guitar. The performance is tragic and the price is very high. We mainly pay for the Ibanez logo itself. The moving bridge is very poor quality. When you push the guitar in, it immediately gets unstable. The pickups are coupled on the amplifier. The sound quality calls for vengeance to heaven. No matter if we want to play punk, rock or metal - every time the sounds are very artificial and flat. For such a price we will buy a much better guitar from another company, but for this better made. A dry guitar doesn't sound like it has a hole in the box at all. I advise against buying such equipment even for beginners."
3555,"""This requires working together with research institutes, big industry and finding innovative ideas that arise during research and then incorporating them into European projects. We have started to work intensively with global companies to use research to create innovative products for an ageing society. Innovation can be about creating new medicines or medical procedures, but also about making health care more efficient through new organisational systems or social innovation "" - added Prof . Woźniak . The Vice-Rector informed that next week in Brussels she will receive a certificate of the European Commission granting the university the EIT reference centre title. The Medical University of Łódź will be the first university in Poland to obtain such a certificate. Thanks to them it will be able to cooperate with 74 EIT centres in Europe."
3556,"Course : I recommend (RADOSA's DIRECT RADOSA speaks for itself) Ms. Kasia is a real angel : D For students really forgiving In the classroom by the board you can get + which affects the final mark of the passing of the wheel : H 1 year 2005 The wheel is with 4 then consultations . The tasks are from the Letters that Kasia solves herself or are solved on her web or in class.

The groups repeat themselves, so learn the tasks from the previous groups because you will probably get them in the next amendment. I have passed in the last amendment, but if someone hasn't passed, they have rewritten the tasks from the list (rewrite all or most of them, i.e. if you are on the list 10 and you do 8, it will pass. My buddy didn't rewrite 1 letter and your cashier wanted to release him but he asked for and rewrote the tasks from the list - she gave him 3.0 )"
3557,"We were in this restaurant in 4 people so I could try 4 different dishes: ) Żurek very tasty, although I prefer the version with potatoes rather than bread, which was given as a sparrow. And as for the dishes . . . hard duck slightly bloody and inedible. And as for the duck, vegetables which are not very sophisticated, you can say that they are taken out of the broth and only a little bit pressed. Pikeperch groats were served completely cold. The turkey is a version for children . And probably only the pork schnitzel was nice enough for the palate. Such portions that I could not wait for dessert and it was already a worthy punt of the program . Cheesecake delicate delicious and cool portion . Raspberries also reliable although beans completely melt in it and lose their crunchiness . I think that if I want to drink beer I will always go there - especially for bananas . But there are a couple of places in Czestochowa where they feed maybe less skilled but a little better . PS . waitress completely did not know how to behave on our side. . . . .more confidence!"
3558,"ATTENTION, WE'RE FEEDING ! ! ! I do not deny the doctor professionalism, but he has zero knowledge of lactation. Here are excerpts from our conversations: The doctor writes down my medication I: what about feeding? L: He advises me to pump and boil the food, out of curiosity: How is this supposed to help? L : Because it kills everything that is bad, you will kill the drugs that get into the milk, after all the cow also drinks boiled food. I : And antibodies ? And digestive enzymes ? L: What antibodies? Antibodies are produced by everyone in the body, not from milk ( ! ) J: Maybe I can advise the lactation advisor and decide if I will buy a prescription. L : What is a ""lactation advisor""? you've never heard 'em, is that what the fb says? ( malicious giggle here ) . You better not listen to the kind of people who advise by the fb. I don't know how cooking kills ( pif - paf ) drugs. But from the Lactation Lexicon of Medicines, they belong to L2 groups. The proctologist is good, but the visit has to be supplemented by your own blindness in the Lexicon or a visit to a lactation advisor."
3559,"Undoubtedly the biggest advantage of the hotel is the view from the rooms located from the port side, especially from the high floors. The building has a great location, right next to the harbour, there are plenty of restaurants around, the centre is about 15 minutes walk away. The downside is a slightly outdated design of the rooms."
3560,"Lofty and unhelpful staff at the reception. Poor breakfasts . . . She ordered me already in January a room for July with a beautiful view of the lake, and got me a cramped room overlooking the balconies of the neighboring Panoramic Hotel - Oscar, with a common balcony for 3 rooms. In the bathroom the toilet seat ""entered"" on the washbasin cupboard. Old dusty furniture in Dutch style. NEGLECTED GARDEN ! ! ! The quality is completely inadequate to the price . Parking was indicated to us one and a half kilometers from the hotel, because the parking lot closer to the hotel was rented on the payroll games. . . I advise against this hotel. . . ."
3561,"Although the game is already old, it is still impressive, and although it is the first time that this game has been played at first sight, it is hard not to notice the advantages of this game. For example, very nice and atmospheric graphics or, in my opinion, one of the biggest advantages of this game is to do your own things that you can play. Nothing like that, but the very fact that something like this is enjoyable. The game level of difficulty changes from level to level, one stage is easy and another is difficult. Many puzzles and thinking, however, puzzles are to be solved in literally 30 seconds for as they wrote on the box of 7-year-olds in another word are simple . The FABLE thin as a spider's piss is in my opinion the worst thing about this game. And for all of this we have sometimes not glithe and baggage which in many people cause in turn: laughter, surprise and neurosis luckily for me it was a niche problem. To sum up, lego Batman is a good game but not without flaws."
3562,"I do not agree with this opinion at all. . . . .I go to this doctor's clinic and he's very nice and nice. I don't know, maybe you have other requirements, but he's great to me. She also got a leaflet from the aesthetic medicine center, which she is the director of, but it only came in handy because she took advantage of the laser scar removal procedure for acne. Besides, before he recommended it to me she got a prescription for a very nice ointment and pills, after which new acne foci are no longer formed - I do not complain and I very much praise your cook = )"
3564,"She bought me a holiday stay in your hotel from 23 . 12 - 26 . 12 . 2016r . for 3 adults and two cats . She made a reservation in October 2016 and made a prepayment of 50% of the costs . The reservation was confirmed by phone on 19 . 12 . 2016r . The offer you presented on the Hotel portal for the holiday period encouraged you to use it . It was cheap, you could take the animals from the beautiful surroundings. However, the reality turned out to be completely different. Already at the time of arrival I met an unpleasant situation, a crowd of screaming people at the reception desk demanding allocation of rooms. I was also qualified to this group because there was no room for me either. The reception staff was completely unprepared to serve guests. There was no orientation on the number of available rooms and the condition of their equipment, living conditions. The resignation of people from staying in the hotel for Christmas caused that we managed to get a room. The room was quite neat and tidy, warm, I was only surprised by the flies in the lampshades, dirty curtains and drapes sticking out of the dirt, dirty walls, an unfit bathroom anyway, because there was no water drain in the shower and sink and no hot water. Dust everywhere. Some old TV without a working remote control. So a nightmare. For two days of my stay, none of the staff were interested in what was going on in the room (maybe no toilet paper, throwing away the trash). Dinner on arrival was quite decent. She tried to take advantage of the attractions that were offered on the holiday offer with her family. Unfortunately: 1 . The cloakroom by the pool smelled of urine, fear of getting undressed, 2 . Dirty and cold water pool was not visible to the bottom at a depth of 1, 2m, 3 . The second pool was clean, but the cold water did not encourage to use it, 4 . Jakuzzi incomplete (used for daily washing of guests because there was hot water in it), 5 . Bowling alley - all belts were closed (not everyone could use it), 6 . Ice rink is closed, it was not frozen on the day of guests' arrival, 7 . Lack of information about the attractions on the second day of the holiday (we did not use them anyway), 8 . Lack of Internet access - no WI-FI coverage, Christmas Eve is a nightmare. Lack of information about the time of dinner and the table booked. The nightmare started at 18.00 . Lack of seats at the table, quarrels with guests dressed for Christmas, crying hungry children, there was no restaurant in the hotel on Christmas Eve. The next disappointment was the lack of full dinnerware. Some plates and cutlery, no bouillons for soup glass for drinks, in fact, were not needed because neither borscht nor compote or even water were not given to us. Christmas Eve dishes on our table are fish in jelly, vegetable salad, herring in cream. The mentioned dishes were served in skimpy bowls, but only in small bowls. Getting dumplings is a horror. The served Christmas Eve dishes were below criticism. Empty dumplings of poor quality. And so did the rest of the dishes. The hit of Christmas Eve was to serve at the end of the evening a platter with boiled potatoes ( only for what ) . The staff - young people, despite their willingness to work, were not able to organize the proper ""publishing"" of the dishes. They themselves were lost in the situation that arose. Lack of a person responsible for service in the Room . The hungry people went to the hotel kitchen by themselves in order to get ""something"" to eat. The sight of what was happening in the room, angry, confused people, crying children forced us to decide to leave the Hotel the next day. Lack of interest at the reception who is leaving the hotel and why. There was no one to talk to about complaints and booking surcharges (she did not pay me for my stay). I do not know if she was checked in at your hotel. It's criminal to treat people like that in these times. Due to the lack of any apologies from you for this situation, which will remain in my family's memory for a long time, spoiling the Christmas mood and the Christmas world itself and the humiliation and arrogance towards my family, I ask you to reimburse me for the costs incurred in paying for my stay and transport costs. Please avoid this Hotel with a wide arch! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
3565,"Many Lyme disease patients do not remember being stabbed by this arachnid. This is not surprising, because, as scientists from the Warsaw University of Life Sciences remind us, the disease is also carried by tick larvae and nymphs, which are so small that they are sometimes difficult to see. Experts make it difficult to see them. Experts make the arachnid, which is stuck in the skin, not to lubricate it with any fat, onion juice or anything else. To get rid of the parasite, it should be grasped right next to the skin and pulled out with a strong movement, perpendicular to the place of insertion. The tick should not be twisted out as this may cause the tick to twist and leave parts of the mouth apparatus in the body. One should also be careful not to press the abdomen on its opits - the arachnid must not be allowed to return the contents of food."
3566,"According to the specialist, this is most evident in gastric cancer, one of the most malignant cancers. The decrease in the incidence of this cancer clearly falls during a period in which some Poles have changed their diet to more beneficial for health. For example, in the years 1960-2005 the consumption of fruit increased in our country by as much as 2.5 times, and vegetables by 41%. In turn, the consumption of salt - which is one of the main risk factors for gastric cancer - fell by 26% between 1999 and 2011. As specialists reminded, salt reduces the thickness of the protective mucous membrane of the stomach - and when it is thinner, it is easier to nest Helicobacter pylori, which increases the risk of gastric cancer."
3567,"I highly recommend to the doctor. She can perfectly listen to the patient, who is in the first place for her. She is professional and at the same time warm, empathic and smiling. She explains in fact what the treatment will consist of, what drugs she will choose and how they will work, and at the same time she left the alternative in the form of psychotherapy to choose from. Discreet, gentle, wonderful person who thoroughly learns the situation of the patient to diagnose him. After the visit she felt the flow of positive thinking. I have light depressive symptoms associated with work and long wondered whether to go for a visit or act alone. I recommend to all hesitant people. Just to get diagnosed and to talk."
3568,"If someone had the opportunity to stay in hotels in Turkey or Egypt of high standard, they will be disappointed. The hotel is not big, but looking after the staff, the staff is not enough. Throughout the week, from morning to late evening, at the bar, or at the ""restaurant"" were the same bartenders/waiters. Only the staff at the reception desk has changed. The ""restaurant"" was one big culinary failure. The first time after the holidays all lost weight was because the food was simply not good. The third day of the stay were the leftovers from the previous two days, only in a changed form or just in other restaurant locations. Apart from that, the food was cold (not that I exaggerated because just after lunch/dinner the food was cold). In the dishes very little choice, dried meats, even fries were inadvertent. Large rooms with quite decent bathrooms. The only drawback was the air conditioning, which could not be properly set. Swimming pool and deck chairs. . . For a hotel like this, the size of the pool is ok. Sun loungers as everywhere I guess, while the covers on them are a bit disgusting in appearance. . . Towels with a deposit of 10 euros for one. After 18, when everyone was already rolling up to their rooms or for dinner, the pool and the place around it was practically not overwhelmed at all. The only thing is to put these sponges and paasols together. The rest was in disarray. . . Generally the hotel has its years, which can be seen at every step of the way, but apart from that, the hotel has a lot of underdevelopment and you can see places such as a storage area for some unnecessary things and staff laughing and smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol in front of guests. As for me and my family on average. Everything was rewarded by the weather."
3569,"I went to the hotel with my mother because of the offer of Medical Resort in August. It was definitely not the right choice for several reasons that I will try to point out: 1 / a small, crowded restaurant with densely arranged tables upstairs for breakfast and dinner; hustle and bustle, coffee and tea queues discouraging hot drinks, no free tables; no proper organization; at the entrance the lady, usually with her head down, more busy with her notes than the guests; The only advantage is that because of the crowd, breakfasts started to be served also in the restaurant on the ground floor, with clearly trained staff and elegant interior; unfortunately, the meals did not delight, very often wilted lettuce 2 / lack of proper organization in the parking lot; cars stand everywhere around the hotel, between the ornamental vegetation, densely around the fountain; here you can not rest 3 / total disgrace of the hotel SPA - even though she made sure by phone that the manicure is using sterilized feet, on the table she found me prepared for me non-sterile feet and only as a result of my intervention the beautician reported the feet in a sterile package; it is worth adding that the beautician took care of herself working in gloves 4 / evenings the hotel does not organize any attractions for the elderly."
3570,"They bought it together with a subscription from Orange and honestly ? She would never buy it with regular money in her life. The programmer is a misunderstanding, the cooking time setting works according to Scandinavian mythology probably, because it certainly does not follow logic. Buttons are for everything and for nothing. The ill-considered functionality of the total to a technically good machine. And those books in which nothing is visible. Oh, and the most annoying thing: keep warm . If I don't want to, I have to pull out the cable. I'm sorry that I can't set whether to keep warm or just turn it off. Instructions: Pull the cable out is embarrassing. This means that the manufacturer is not responsible for setting the cooking time and stability of the keep warm option. If you go to work and the cooking will not last the set two hours only 10, and during this time the appliance will have a steam hole on the half-open option, then if you cook and burn the apartment it is your fault because you were not at the end of the cooking. In total: ok, for 50 zloty I can have an underdeveloped steamer, an underdeveloped soup pot, an underdeveloped omelette pot, etc. But still I think that the appliance should not have been given away with such underdeveloped items for mass production."
3571,"We were both at the resort for the weekend. At 200 zloty for a room with breakfast and dinner, I thought the standard would be normal. Meanwhile, in the room, the beds were covered with sheets that were too small. You will need to sleep on a bare mattress. The bathroom has a rusty heater and a torn plug, neither gel nor liquid soap. Room size ok. The biggest disappointment was the food. 15 zloty for a person, and on the patient's side separated food, as in the hospital, 3 sheets of ham, 3 sheets of cheese, a piece of butter, and 3 sheets of tomato, one sachet of Saga tea. And a bread. . . The lady even said that she could bring the bread, only for what? Like there's nothing left on the plate. No matter if it's a child or an adult or a woman or a man. All the portions are equally calculated. . . For breakfast the same set, plus one cooked steamer. The lady brought the same thing with four steamers per table, and immediately warned that one per person so that there was no misunderstanding. You have to sign up for the pool beforehand, only available for 50 minutes a day. The pool is cold, the cloakrooms are even greener. With such a competition in the market, for 200 zloty per room per day, I think you can do much better elsewhere! ! ! I recommend only for seniors on medical holidays. . . ."
3572,"When asked about the financing of the new facility, Ortyl pointed out that in the new organisational formula the leading body will be the university. ""This means that for the university, the ministry that carries out direct supervision is the ministry of science and higher education, but the ministry of health will also have a substantive influence on this. But the status of the hospital will clearly change,"" he said. The Marshal pointed out that after the transformation the hospital ""enters the formula of financing university clinical hospitals"" . ""It is not just a simple contract with the National Health Fund. There are also funds for research, for special procedures. Funds for the whole process are increased up to 20% in some areas, some procedures. The hospital will also have access to the Operational Programme + Infrastructure and Environment + and not just as now to the Regional Operational Programme"" - explained Ortyl ."
3573,""" The questions are usually related to the disease entity and the condition of the patient in order to detect any negative symptoms early. In this way we obtain the results of measurements and a description of the patient's condition, i.e. relevant data which, when collected systematically, give rise to therapeutic decisions. In this way we are able to keep the patient in a better condition in the context of key clinical parameters,"" Dahle pointed out. The equipment for seniors is very simple to use; the devices are equipped with ""bluetooth low energy"" technology and have a small number of buttons. Within the system, the doctor does not have to be available all the time, as so-called ""alerts"" are emitted when certain values of examined parameters are exceeded. ""This allows for a lower occupancy of specialist personnel and we are able to better manage health care"" - assessed Staroń ."
3574,"The top spot is the nearly one-week stays, which almost 52% of us choose. If longer stays in hotels are definitely in those by the sea (6 days on average). During long weekends, the most popular destinations are Mazury, the mountains (Podkarpacie), Małopolska and the Lublin region, which is becoming more and more popular among Poles (on average 4 days). Fast, weekend relaxation in the SPA is, in turn, the vicinity of large cities, due to the speed and ease of access and limited time. The basic service of soup powder or canned food taken from home and eaten in hotel rooms is enough."
3575,"The doctor made a good impression on her first visit. Unfortunately, the next ones were on the basis of a pass mark, she did not give any referrals for tests only after talking to the patient said that everything will be fine. And she set another date. The patient reported strong pain and general weakness. However, the doctor didn't order any tests except for the x-rays. As it turned out, these examinations were very necessary because there were metastases and a quick reaction and further treatment was needed. The doctor, throwing off her responsibility, suggested to call an ambulance. A few hours of waiting in front of the doctor's office for a certificate of completion of treatment was also not nice Lack of understanding for the family of a seriously ill patient, lack of any support. Unfortunately we do not recommend it."
3576,"Attention! This object makes it seem as if no one is in charge of it and no one is supervising it. At every step you can see the ruin, lack of renovations and savings. The website contains photos and information that do not correspond to reality. This is a fraud ! The photos are out of date and show the object as it was several years ago. Nowadays it is no longer so e.g. an outdoor swimming pool - lost (shock!), no Jacuzzi (which can also be seen in the pictures) . After a spectacular quarrel of one of the guests, someone from the staff finally came to the algae and . . . . placed a sign that the pool is closed . Then he clumsily tried to remove them but for me it was an obvious chemical deficiency - another saving. The pictures also show beautiful furniture by the pool and umbrellas, but it's also history. We received a room that was not in line with the order, taking into account that the reservation made to 'em in March 2014. The bars referred to on the website do not exist, except for the pool bar on the fourth floor, where there was not even beer. The food is unsavoury and there are continuous deficiencies that are not filled on an ongoing basis . Empty platters and plates are a normal sight there. The tiny selection and repeatability, and the staff have not kept up with the completion of even these few dishes. After reporting a fridge failure during the whole period of stay no one appeared to it. The first one is the first one to be able to get a good look at the restaurant and the second one to be able to get a good look at the restaurant and the second one to be able to get a good look at the restaurant and the third one to be able to get a good look at the restaurant. The most important thing to consider is that the prices for staying in this ruin are shockingly high, completely inadequate to the offer. I do not recommend it and I warn you! ! ! I know this place because I've been here 6 times - last time. The object has a huge potential, but it was completely wasted, and such a thing as this year it never was."
3577,"As much as three billion zlotys, i.e. half of all expenditure on diabetes, generate complications of the disease, of which 75% generate heart complications, 14% of strokes, 8% of kidney disease and 1% each of eye disease and diabetic rate. Between 2009 and 2012 the total cost of treatment of complications (direct and indirect) increased by approximately . 550 million . As Professor . Czupryniak, in order to stop the rate at which diabetes expenditure is growing, intensive state action is needed in the fight against obesity and social education on healthy lifestyles, as this will prevent many new cases of type 2 diabetes. ""On the other hand, type 2 diabetes patients need to be sought more actively in society. By early detection of the disease, even before the occurrence of complications, appropriate treatment can be applied beforehand to prevent or delay them"" - noted the diabetologist. Nowadays, still too many patients (about one third) find out that they have diabetes only when the disease is seriously complicated."
3578,"Monchigue is a tiny, sleepy little town at the ""end of the world"" and its charm lies in its location on a hill. And here is the hotel where we spent 2 nights. The place is quite unique and impressed me - big enough that I decided to write about it. The hotel building from the outside is modest, rather bland. The rooms are very comfortable, elegant. Several rooms including ours have beautiful large balconies overlooking almost the ""jungle. This is because behind the hotel building, guests are greeted by a real jungle - an exotic, lush vegetation overgrown by the sides of the ravine, it goes up the stairs to the town. A great place. Upstairs it is climatic, as if time stopped a long time ago - a restaurant in an old tavern building from the 17th century. The food. . . ...good, wine even better. And in the morning we were woken up by singing birds living in a tangle of branches and leaves. I remember this place very well, it is worth visiting the Hotel Terma in Monchique if you are on a hike or go for a longer stay."
3579,"The service is not pleasant, arrogant and incompetent. The owner in pretensions with too high an opinion, I do not know if about yourself, but surely about the facility that would be considered at most a socialist guesthouse, but certainly not a 4 star hotel. The rooms are satisfactory, the view from the restaurant is beautiful. Besides, a total failure. No person to bring luggage (in this class of facility required), dirty lamps, burnt bulbs, no paper in public toilets. Stains on carpets . The way of preparing meals also left a lot to be desired. If I ever get to Plock again, I will sooner decide to spend the night ""under a cloud"". than in this facility."
3580,"She was in this hotel for the third time. We are a couple of young people so we were treated as if we couldn't afford this hotel and we should thank you at all that we can spend the night in a room with the air-conditioning in repair, a TV without color and the internet is not needed for anything and nobody cares that we have to use it. The lady at the reception smiled at our complaints. I do not know how our money differs from foreigners, but it is clearly different in terms of service. I prefer to go to another hotel or a hotel of a lower standard and do not require it than to be disappointed once again. I'm not going to go back there definitely ."
3581,"Speaking about the upcoming change in the health care system, the Minister emphasized that two teams are currently working in the Ministry of Health: System Changes and Basic Health Care, which are preparing statutory changes, including the liquidation of the National Health Fund. ""The NFZ is an institution which provides universal health insurance, and this solution means that among Poles there are insured and uninsured, entitled and not entitled to use the universal health care system. Those who are uninsured currently live in Poland approx. 2,5 million - and this is an untenable situation. We are moving towards the introduction of the so-called ""civic entitlement"" - everyone who is ill and needs help should receive it. In this situation the NFZ as an institution loses its raison d'être"" - he explained ."
3583,"We spent a very nice week at the Kiston Hotel in September. Since it was already after the season, there were not many guests, which was even an advantage when we could freely use the hotel's attractions: massages in the spa area (I recommend back massage), saunas and, of course, a spacious swimming pool with jacuzzi, wild boar, and a shallow children's area (with a ""water tongue"" and a slideway, which was very much to our daughter's liking). In the swimming pool area there are generally available accessories for swimming useful especially for children (boards, children's lifeboat, hoses). The hotel is located in seclusion, in a quiet area. The area surrounding the hotel is large and is great for walks - lots of greenery, some trees, for children's 'mini zoo' with poultry and 2 horses (which for an uncooked price you can ride or order a carriage ride). Despite the bad weather, we had a very nice time and had a good rest. The Wi Fi works very well and is available without extra charges. Adult guests can count on bathrobes and soft slippers. The service is very helpful and helpful. Upon arrival, we reported a malfunction of the wardrobe and it was removed immediately. There was also no problem with postponing the departure 2 hours later than the end of the hotel day. We purchased a stay with breakfast served in the form of a Swedish table - with a sufficient choice of dan - from muesli with milk, yoghurt, wedges and bread. There was also the possibility to order scrambled eggs, omelette, pancakes and steams. In addition, hot and cold drinks. Prices of lunch dishes from the card started from 34 zloty; dishes that we tasted were tasty and elegantly served."
3584,"A quick visit, I was hoping for something more than a standard prescription of treatment, which I suggested. She thought I would get the drugs done, which are also effective, or at least the care tips. In conclusion, she found out nothing new and any doctor could prescribe the medication given by the patient."
3585,"Course : inorganic chemistry I - exercise . Maybe the doctor has a specific approach to students in class, but thanks to that he can teach very well. Classes conducted at a very high level. You have to be prepared for each exercise because you do not know when you will go to the board: wine: but thanks to that I did not have the slightest problems with passing the material for the 5th. I recommend to all those who will not be scared during the first classes, because Dr. Kordon is able to convey the knowledge and at a high level: wink:"
3586,"The doctor is very kind and gentle to examine, unfortunately, I had the impression that it was a bit too busy, hence the assessment. She immediately passes the phone number and ensures that you can call and write at any time, so if you have problems you are not left alone with the problem, which is a huge plus and comfort when you are having a pregnancy. Unfortunately, the visit was delayed by about half an hour, which in the case of private visits seems to me to be quite a slip, and the lady at the reception mentioned that this is typical. After sending the results of the tests the doctor said that everything is fine, another doctor later told me to repeat one of the tests because it went out of scope. Eventually I decided to have a pregnancy with the other doctor, so my opinion is for one visit."
3587,"All right. Great service, extra food. Breakfast great, for no big deal plus. Dinners we didn't have, so we ordered from the card. Fresh fish and regional dishes at six with a plus. The only downside is the atmosphere during the dinner, where the hotel guests with half board go around the Swedish tables. Not their fault. Rather, he would advise the restaurant manager to separate the area for guests who order carded dishes. Generally a great place to relax. And once the weather is right, it must be great. We were not lucky enough, but we recommend this place!"
3588,"The fact of having such a large number of hotels is not obvious, because it is difficult to find information available to the public on this subject. Although Blackstone itself is a public company which is required to provide financial and operational information, individual hotel projects are usually private companies which are not required to provide detailed information. Photo: Founded in 1985, the Blackstone Group is based in New York. PS . A little more information about the number of rooms and hotels owned by Blackstone is given on its blog ""Lodging Hospitality"". According to "" LH "" Blackstone Group owns 5,613 hotels worldwide with 829,510 rooms. In the United States and Canada, Blackstone owns 5,463 hotels with 798,070 rooms."
3589,"It was an unforgettable honeymoon. The hotel was quite expensive but worth the price, we spent only 3 nights there but it was enough for us to remember it very well. We had a double room on the last, exclusive floor of the hotel. The room was large, comfortable and very spacious. Breakfast is delicious and the coffee is excellent, the service is very nice and polite. Of course, we have used the spa treatments that we have also been very happy with and the thermal pools that have been super relaxing after a day in the mountains. We sincerely recommend and hope to return to this hotel quickly."
3590,"Yes, I have mixed feelings. The reception is not 5 *, which is 3 * at the most, despite the fact that it was ok after the contact was made. I got to a big party and the reception desk put me in a room on the mezzanine so I had a party noise and then half the night a loud dismantling of the equipment: - (The rooms are very ok. What I recommend is a gym - it's mainly for the city, so they slice steroids, coke and other mixtures in big colourful bubbles."
3591,"Prof . Rosiak explained that in their research, Łódź scientists were confronted with literature reports on the use of a simple tetrapeptide to induce angiogenesis by delivering it to the treated body area. It is a compound naturally formed in the human body, with a relatively short half-life of 5 minutes, hence its concentration in a normally functioning body is very low. This tetrapeptide has been registered as a drug and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ""However, it was injected into the tissues surrounding the wound, which made it impossible to control the area of action and had the typical effects of reaching high concentrations rapidly and disappearing as rapidly as possible, thus negating its therapeutic effect. Our original idea, worldwide, therefore boils down to trying to combine a hydrogel dressing with this tetrapeptide"" - explained the scientist."
3592,"Hmm... . . .when she first came to see me at your doctor's over six months ago she was a completely different person: full of anxiety, not knowing who I really am, what I want, powerless, in total depression. The next meetings helped me to understand what it is, what I have to work on, who I really am. She is a wonderful person, full of understanding, she does not speed up anything, she does not judge anything and in this difficult time she is a point of attachment and support. And at the same time demanding, because in this fight a lot depends on us, on our self-denial and willingness to change, which is not always easy. I know that I still have a lot of work ahead of me, but I'm already on the right track and I'm getting happier. Thank you: )"
3593,"Dr. Markuszewski is a specific person, I have been looking into him for 3 years, she has been walking with me regularly very often, waiting for a few hours to visit. . . to hear the same thing again. That is sleeping on my back, not putting my leg on, diet, natural underwear, no inserts, skirt and preferably without panties. Maybe there is also something in it, but I do not expect the doctor to mattify me about my lifestyle, only that he will professionally tell me what is wrong. He could talk endlessly about the fact that I have cold feet, I do not feel pleasure during the intercourse and when she asked me specific questions, she heard that everything will be fine just to listen to him. Sometimes she had the impression that these visits were the foundation of his ego, because he didn't allow any comments and facts - well, who knows better than me if my feet are cold and if my left breast hurts more than my right. . . He detected a condyloma in me, which he froze twice. Finally, she started to know about the subject herself and I know that the condyloma is not macroscopically determined but you have to do an examination (he did not even tell me about such a possibility) for the presence of the hpv virus. . . he treated blindly what he saw and deleted for every treatment 200 PLN and of course visits 80 PLN . today confirmed that I do not have the condyloma. When she was getting inflammation she always went out with the same globules (like every patient) and never treated her partner. in short - to avoid from far away!"
3594,"I was wondering for a long time what to write about Mrs. Martha. She's a professional. With blood and bones. He was very afraid to go to a therapist, but he got overwhelmed by them. He never convinced em to go to psychologists or psychotherapists. Mrs. Marta disenchanted me with all my fears about psychologists. It's not a doctor who says one thing and does another. Let's start with the fact that at the first session I was very afraid of 'em. Mrs. Marta calmly approached me and slowly drew fear from me. At the next meetings it was getting better and better. So when you have something down in your life style, you feel that maybe you don't control everything in life and it controls you, you start to be afraid of everything, you think you're worth nothing (a), contact a psychotherapist and choose Marta Reichel. Marta does not judge, does not indicate, does not impose her opinion. It helps to find the way you should go to be happy. It is known that she will not take credit, home problems, stress from us, but she will help to deal with them. Thanks to her I know that maybe these gigantic problems just seem gigantic. I will say for my part that thanks to her I managed to regain the inner happiness and the desire to live that I needed so much. She helped me to believe in myself and my abilities again. Once again, a big thank you to Marta Reichel that she helped me to find back what I had lost em, the joy of living."
3595,"We took the doctor's advice and said that I would have ""normal"" situations - ""normal"" childhood diseases, rather than particularly difficult cases. The doctor is very kind and has a great attitude towards children. She is also very specific, she answers every question in detail and explains everything. She is effective in treating it. In several diagnoses she turned out to be better than the laboratory - only the next examination in the laboratory confirmed the doctor's assessment of the situation. On the other hand, everyone should decide for himself what he expects from the doctor: a) to reach for decisive methods (e.g. antibiotics, steroid ointments), or b) to treat such methods as a ""necessary evil"" and look for milder but effective means first. On the basis of the experience of my family and my parents several other children, Dr. Mysliwiec would include me in the first group."
3596,"The approach to the customer from unwillingness and to the detached what in this field of business is inexcusable. The tragedy of the photo and the opinions written earlier are 100% true . In my opinion, if you go on holiday it's better to throw in something and have a holy peace and good time and not watch it quiet what is going on there. If I wasn't from the travel agency, I'd only spend one day there. The view of the sea, which gives offices is a mockery because he is not behind the trees and the big blue hotel. There is an old ping-pong table with no net and no pallets. The cleaners are doing a good job you have to admit. The only ones holding the level. The water stands in the bathroom, the water barely flows down the toilet. The ghost has to pay for everything. The fridge cools down the bdb TV with 4 channels which is 20 years old. The challenges are a tragedy. I thought they no longer do so in catering but I was wrong because such restaurants fall naturally. Throughout my stay I didn't notice that anyone would use the wi - fi, we can't even drink beer or a drink from the bar really ZERO! It speaks for itself so that no one there even orders beer on holiday is probably something wrong. The boss nonstop internet haha words have been confirmed. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! OTHERS let them die!"
3597,"A medium sized hotel that offers exactly what it promises: affordable accommodation with no luxuries, just right to get some sleep, eat something in the morning and go on. The hotel is located in the very centre of Krasnystaw. There is no lift, so it is not suitable for the disabled. Medium sized rooms, clean, reasonably comfortable beds. Bathroom with basic cosmetics, you could use a refurbishment (the washbasin was quite wobbly). Breakfast is quite tasty, but I rather advise against sausages."
3598,"It is easy to divide them into two groups: those who have a different (usually main and supporting) business outside the hotel and entrepreneurs for whom the hotel is a dominant or sole venture. For the former, very often the guest is just a number - a statistic that earns them more money. For the latter, the guest is a person, often treated very individually. In this case, unforced and natural hospitality dominates. This is because the basis is the needs of the person, not the owner. Such a distinction can be found and read about it even in the opinions of guests ( ! ) . The guest simply feels the attraction with which he is treated."
3599,"I am 2 days before the surgery, I had to deal with many different doctors and I think that people today demand great enthusiasm from doctors, the more so when they pay for the visit, I don't need it and even annoy me. I like the concrete, professional and honest opinion. The kindly conversations are good for coffee with friends, it's about our health or as a result of plastic surgery, a health hazard, so why the forced courtesies. I am not hiding during the first visit fell a joke on my part that if this surgery was never performed by Dr. ever, then as with the ""first time"" he will certainly try very hard, laughing assured that he certainly did. I have no objections, the surgery I am not afraid, I have a good feeling and that's it :) Greetings to you all"
3600,"Dr. Kuźlan is a wonderful person and a brilliant surgeon ! She had her nose completely corrected on January 14th 2016. Two weeks have passed since the surgery and the effect is amazing ! The nose is still swollen and already looks beautiful. I am very pleased ! After the consultation with Dr. Kuznan, I was sure that I want to do this surgery with her. The medical care at the highest level, Dr. Kuznan's approach to the patient before the surgery and also 100% satisfaction on my part. If I am ever going to use plastic surgery in the future, I will definitely use Dr. Kuzlan's services! ! ! ! : ) ) ) : ) : ) Finally she got rid of my life complex and I look in the mirror with a smile on my face. My confidence has increased enormously. Everyone is considering plastic surgery because of the complex I recommend! ! ! : )"
3601,"We spent 3 days in the Castle of Gutters. The castle was wonderful, we were family in 4 people we had a large chamber. We bought our stay with a package that included a guided tour of the castle and a thrill, there was also a dinner for which we all dressed up in medieval costumes, knightly shows - an interesting attraction for children and adults. We took part in a bowling tournament. The food was great. The pool was not big but very nicely designed, there were no pistons. Surroundings of beauty . We recommend to everyone this hotel"
3602,"Hotel in a very good standard located in Malta 3 minutes from Malta Thermal Baths and Lake Malta, close to a shopping mall and recreational areas. A great place to relax. Hotel after a gentle lift, very clean, cool swimming pool. Very cool with instead of water in rooms on each floor is a water distributor. Minus one lift and no air conditioning in the rooms. The staff at the reception desk is perfect, comparable to a 5 star room, during my stay I talked to 3 ladies, each competent and helpful, took the initiative to solve the problem. It is very rare to have a staff who want to do something. Checking in quickly and nicely. A lot of valuable advice, map, help with location. Generally the hotel 4 out of 5 . Discounted for lack of air conditioning."
3603,"I recently bought a computer with this power supply, I'll say yes. . . . . .if someone is a demanding player and generally likes to play around, it is NOT a power supply for you, for example, when I started Sims 3 the power supply was so loud that you could hear it all over the house, the graphics card is getting awfully hot through it, and with a high load it is just unbearable, even the music is not able to deafen it. . . and it's not the What is love type, but sharp metal."
3604,"I have read recent positive reviews about this hotel and I really don't know if we were in the same place. The hotel has actually been renovated and the rooms look better than in 2013, but it is not the rooms that make a nice stay just service. The lady at the reception desk is very bland, neither smiles nor conversations. She did her job, so why don't you try something extra. Another tragedy is dinner. The lady mistook the beer, forgot about the soup. At the end of our stay in the restaurant she was very nice and apologized for the shortage, but the disgust remained. However, the breakfast deserves special attention. Choose a wedding and a cheese very delicious. However, we were shocked when, after asking for a fried egg, which was not, and should be without question, we heard that the kitchen will prepare it for an additional fee of 5 zloty! ! ! Unfortunately for me it is not acceptable to ask for an additional fee, and that's as high as 1 egg. So next time we will definitely choose another hotel."
3605,"She chose the hotel for a women's outing, and it was definitely a hit! Very nice service. Rooms are spacious, clean (which was a very nice change after staying in Sandra Spa in Karpacz), booking indicated that I will be with a few months old child. After entering the room, she was very positively surprised because it was waiting for _ us hotel room for the little one as well. A cot, bedding, a set of cosmetics, as well as a bathrobe and towels for the youngest guest. Tasty cuisine, varied meals, waiters discreet and very nice. If it wasn't for the bad access to Ustka, I would already be packing up again. I sincerely recommend it. The price in relation to the quality of services provided is really affordable!"
3606,"Oh, long story short. . . . .but I think he's a great orthopedist. Let's talk about it. I'm the one who's been in great contact with him. He treated me after a car accident, answered every question, showed up whenever she asked me to talk. He was a great specialist. And he understood - without words: )"
3607,"He stressed that a given simulator can be ""tasked"" with a sequence of specific events, including complications that may occur in real life and even those that occur rarely, and the student must react accordingly. The student's behaviour can be immediately assessed whether or not he is receiving the right treatment and intervenes in the treatment. Within the framework of the project, the staff of the Białystok University will undergo appropriate training in Poland and abroad. The project also involves mentoring . Groups of several medical students will select mentors under the direction of whom they will work. ""We plan to create a database of scenarios related to various simulated patients. After the end of the project the university wants to ""employ"" patients who will learn to simulate specific diseases, and the students will have the task - ""to correctly collect the history, properly examine this patient, make a diagnosis, propose treatment"" - said Chabowski ."
3608,"Prof . Krętowski noted that in the field of such research his centre is one of the pioneers. ""In the last few months we have received equipment which is nowhere else in Poland"" - said the Vice-Rector. Thanks to the modern equipment, scientists will be able to analyze proteins and chemicals in blood or urine which are evidence of a given disease. They will also be able to examine human genes in search of information useful in detecting and treating diseases. ""First of all, we will want to find the markers of the disease at an early stage, and secondly, to choose the right treatment for the patient,"" said the scientist. He added that his unit wants it to be competitive with other projects in the world. ""We rely on the most modern technologies, which, however, generate huge amounts of data"" - said the PAP interlocutor. He explained that all parameters that can be tested in blood will be examined. ""So by examining one patient we get hundreds of thousands if not millions of data. Somebody has to interpret this data. We are a medical university, but we need the support of people who can analyze such data using, for example, artificial intelligence"" - said prof . Krętowski and pointed out that for this we need experienced bioinformatics or biostatisticians. That is why the Bialystok unit has already established cooperation with the Belgian Hasselt University."
3609,"Almost a year ago, the Doctor operated on my right foot hallux. Unfortunately, the metatarsal bone was cut too much. Also, Akina's osteotomy of the proximal phalanx was performed. As a result, now the big toe is bent outwards, which does not look aesthetic, and most importantly it reduces the comfort of walking and causes pain. I am writing an opinion after a long time after surgery and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, I do not have a good feeling, the setting is even worse than before the surgery, and it was a correction of small deviations and bones. I am not satisfied or even surprised by such a negative result."
3610,"Very weak is not enough. This lady shouldn't be taking care of myeloma patients! ! ! ! She has no idea. It is sad and reprehensible to pretend to be a specialist in the treatment of this very serious disease, and the treatment methods are 20 years back. The doctor should make the patient aware of the different methods of treatment, often giving a chance for a longer life, and not use palliative treatment for people who have a good chance of a transplantation, but with their treatment methods they should definitely close the way to transplantation. Scandal, where is your conscience, doctor? ? ? ! ! ! ! !"
3611,"I have booked an overnight stay in hostel 70s . On the day I was staying at the hostel, I was texted that I have to pick up the keys at another place about 3km from the place I was staying. This information was not given when booking! In addition, it was very uncomfortable when I arrived in Krakow at 23rd. 00 and I would have to go to get the keys! I gave up my stay in this place!"
3612,"I have hashimoto , my thyroid is already the size of a 6-year-old child's thyroid. Mrs. Dr. Dr. has a tsh test, does not test ft3 or ft4, the question is why, she answers that it is not necessary, the symptoms of disregard: hair falls out? my hair falls out too! fatigue for no reason? eat less! dry skin? you have to use lotions and so on. . . I don't know if you don't know about hashimoto and hyperactivity, if you have a patient in your nose."
3613,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this doctor. We were at his place on a private visit (cost 170 PLN) with his daughter, he didn't see his daughter's MRI, he said that we have to do an additional examination and it turned out that on the MRI the whole spine was visible and some things could be excluded right away and not scare us with further complications (a week later the same MRI was seen by neurosurgeons from Warsaw) He advised against the operation of unhooking my daughter's core, He said that it is better not to interfere in her spine and wait until the paresis occurs and only then to operate (this could condemn my child to permanent disability). If he looked carefully at the MRI images as a few days later the cd specialists would perhaps notice that next to the anchored core the adipose tissue spread so that the operation would not be difficult and complicated. My child is already after the operation in Warsaw, he is fully healthy, if he listened to the conservative Dr. Larrysz, at some point my child could become a cripple. A lot of information that he gave us during this consultation turned out to be wrong. And the doctor's behavior was quite arrogant, without any sympathy or willingness to explain to the parents - laymen - the essence of the disease. We were disappointed when we left him and after visiting the CZD in Warsaw we realized how wrong he was. I definitely do not recommend it."
3614,"Unfortunately, I'm not happy. I still feel the problem I was experiencing and despite the request for a thorough examination the doctor said that everything is ok. Now I have to go to the pharmacy and ask for help there despite spending a large amount of money on a visit to a specialist . She had a feeling that I was there because she thought of something. I'm sorry about that because she seemed nice. But I guess she was more kind than thorough in her study."
3615,"Nice driveway and large parking lot . Nice and spacious reception desk . Very nice and helpful people at the reception . A small room, takes you to other times. . . The People's Republic of Poland is clanning. From the entrance the smell of cigarettes and ""smells"" from the toilet. This spoiled the first very nice feeling. The furniture is very tired. . . There was a bathtub in the room and a plastic curtain if someone wants to take a shower. If the neighbor turns off the water, he cuts off the heat in the next room. At least that's what I had. A colleague in the room had a 70% drop in shower pressure. . . Breakfast is tasty but very poor. Prices in the hotel bar are very comfortable. . ."
3616,"It's difficult to judge someone who hasn't enough that he has refused to treat it, he took money for it without the slightest embarrassment. My mother is in very serious condition after a serious medical error which led to intestinal necrosis, stoma and further complications in the form of an abscess and an unhealing wound. The doctors who have successively taken care of my mother have confined themselves to treating her without any vision of comprehensive treatment - surgical removal of the abscess and/or reconnecting the intestines. I try to understand this somehow - not everyone was born predestined for this profession. However, after nearly a year of wandering around county hospitals, when my mother finally left the hospital for a little longer, I decided to hit em privately to - as I thought - a top-notch specialist. Nothing could be further from the truth! The professor, whose time is very limited, just took a look at the first two discharges from the hospitals (there were 8 of them together). Something even started scribbling on a piece of paper, but he quickly got bored of the job and declared that he could not deal with it! I was walled up! My shock was even greater when, at our begging requests to try to help my mother, he thanked us and informed us that we should receive 200 PLN for the visit! At the end he asked a supplementary question: are we here on someone's orders? When he heard that it was ""some"" friend of mine, he said that we had to deal with ourselves. So much for the visit."
3617,"This hotel unfortunately has nothing to do with 5 *, in my opinion it deserves a maximum of 2 * or 3 *. One big dirt and stink. Rooms: Sufficient in size for a family of 4 people. We had a view over the sea, so that's a plus. However, the stench coming out of the bathroom was unbearable. It was caused by a badly connected drain from the sink (no siphon was used to block unpleasant smells). In addition, there was a fungus and stone everywhere in the bathroom. Minibar is a barely working fridge, which was filled up during our stay only once (although its contents are paid for). In addition, just after our arrival in the room was completely empty and we could not even drink water after a long journey. Cleaning: Performed throughout the hotel superficial and not everywhere. The cleaning lady cleaned our room for the first time only during the third day of our stay and in addition, she limited herself to wiping the floor with a mop and putting bath towels in the bathroom (because until then we did not have such towels). Of course, the cleaning did not cover the bathroom. On the floors the tiles are laid only in the vicinity of the elevator, in the rest of the corridor is old, clogged and not vacuumed carpet. The cleanliness of the restaurant was not ideal either. The staff did not complete sets of cutlery and tablecloths (practically there was no shortage of something on the table). There was also an unpleasant smell. After the rest of the places available to the public, you could also see that cleaning is not practiced in this hotel. Meals: Meals daily the same (with minor changes) . In all bars and restaurants, drinks were served in thin disposable plastic cups, even drinks and wine. Swimming pool : In my opinion, too small for the number of rooms. When the slides are activated there is practically no place to swim. Equipped with deck chairs and broken and delicate umbrellas. Service: Nice, but people outside the reception did not speak English. 95% of the hotel's guests are Russian citizens and the hotel staff was only able to communicate in this language. Location: The hotel is located on a busy road, which can be heard with the windows in the room and the pool open. The access to the amphibians is far away and the hotel has no direct tunnel. Contrary to what is written in the ad it is not even in the Side area. However, there was nothing around the hotel except a gas station and Turkish houses. Animations: The hotel employed two animators: one was only for volleyball and the other for children. In the evening there were outdoor group shows (typical: Turkish night, stunts, live music)."
3618,"In the case of an IgE-dependent allergy, an allergic march may occur, i.e. another form of allergy, such as bronchial asthma or allergic rhinitis. This is facilitated by the so-called cross reactions, when one allergen paves the way for another. They occur between different food, food and inhalation allergens (plant pollen and animal hair) and food and contact allergens (e.g. with latex). Typical cross reactions are birch - apple - nut, celery - carrot - mug - spice, banana - latex and mites - snails. ""This does not mean, however, that a child with ABMK should be eliminated from the diet of beef and veal, because in time he will be allergic to them. It happens only in 10 percent of cases, which is very rare"" - convinces Prof . Szajewska . Children allergic to cow's milk protein should not drink goat's milk. In this case the risk of developing an allergy to goat's milk protein reaches as much as 90% ."
3619,"I strongly advise against it. Worst experience of staying in any center . Nurses naughty . The reception desk was under-informed and unprofessional (3 ladies), which each time the greeting ""Good morning"" did not even force themselves to raise their eyes from the computer, not to mention the smile, Upon arrival at the site it turned out that in the parking lot reserved by us in March there was no room for our car and that the car owners in the parking lot made a reservation earlier from us, which proved to be untrue because the lady with whom we sat at one table during meals made a reservation a month before arrival at the sanatorium. Then we were sent back by the lady from the reception to the nurses to complete the required formalities. After a few minutes of waiting, the ladies arrived carrying the lunches, which they hoped to eat soon. Unfortunately, they had to serve us, which they did very spraying and processing. The doctor with 3 due treatments only 2 wet treatments, claiming that this will be good for your health, at the same time there is an unlimited opportunity to buy yourself such, but already against payment. Just after receiving the schedule of treatments during the first treatment, the young lady who operates the whirlpool brazenly, with a brawl, that she will not do this treatment both to me and my husband at an hour. 14 . 00 because she does it before lunch and not after lunch. As a result of the intervention of the Lord from the reception (who is a man of high personal culture and the only employee of the reception who can fully answer any question about the stay in the center), it turned out that this treatment will take place at the time specified on the schedule. The staff generally tries to do their job as soon as possible and go home. Only the lady doing the back massage is professional in her work and is a very good professional in her field. The package also included the possibility to use the gym until the hour. 21 . 00 . In practice, we learned that the last entrance is at . 19 . 30 . One evening we were asked for a key to the gym, a lady by the pool angrily handed us the keys to the gym, knowing perfectly well that we wouldn't get there because the door preceding the entrance to the room was already closed. We could only use the gym thanks to the courtesy of a very dear Lord who guarded the building and had all the keys to it. The swimming pool was to be at our disposal from one hour. 15 . 00 to 21 . 00 . It turned out to be not always possible because twice during our short stay the place in the pool was reserved for aerobics classes. The food was very unpleasant and undifferentiated. Generally, in all respects, typical of the Polish People's Republic. The service was very spraying, without the basic principles of elementary culture. A young man guarding the entrance to the Pump Room for our ''Good morning'' and showing the guest card was responsible each time ''Aha'' . We have the impression that we were treated as if we were being pushed, not as if we were the people who made sure that all these employees had a job. A lot has yet to be done to make this place a friendly place, at European level. Unfortunately."
3620,"The hotel is located in a quiet area at the very beach, which is rocky, recommended water shoes. The beach chairs are free of charge and there are enough of them. Landing planes are an additional attraction rather than a problem. About 20 minutes away from the beach you will reach Trianta with lots of shops and restaurants. To the capital of the island you can take the bus about 30 minutes. The food is tasty although breakfast is monotonous. Mega nice gentlemen from pizza and gyros boy . Pizza and gyros alone delicious . Drinks good and in AI formula a big choice . Animation on a good level all day long something is happening . The room, in the main building, clean but would be useful to refresh. Generally a hotel worth recommending."
3621,"Surprisingly, in the era of widely promoted booking services and their opinion-forming functions, as well as social media, this experience is four times more important factor of choice. Of course, very many guests use both booking platforms and social media in the process of choosing a hotel. However, with the results, we can assume that they serve more to collect information and possibly give up certain options than the choice. Earlier guest stay is the key to future bookings."
3622,"We have just returned from a 9-day holiday with children of 5 and 9 years. The hotel is located in a good location 15 minutes from the airport and 100 meters from the beach. More good things in this hotel are unlikely to be found. The English language is only at the reception and at some basic, the staff is unlikely to be sympathetic to the customers as in the ""ladybug"" without making anyone miserable. The food rather everyone will find something for himself if he likes to chill out, the fruit got rotten in one day and that one slice of mouldy bread which was a surprise to us that the staff did not notice it. We are most surprised by the level of animation for children and adults or the lack thereof. Hotel rather for pensioners who are not looking for any entertainment I strongly advise against family with children."

3624,"After more than 30 years of fighting asthma and allergy, I got 'em to the Doctor. I am very disappointed with my approach to the patient (I was given a clear understanding that if something had happened to me because of the chewing gum that I had forgotten to get rid of before entering the office, it would have been more of a problem with the lengthening of the queue than my health) and the approach to the treatment itself. I was discouraged from desensitization. He got em an irrational explanation for the cat allergy. In addition, em was treated like a child, despite being of the right age. I do not recommend ."
3625,"I've been using the epilator for a year now and you can say that I'm moderately delighted to have its pros and cons the first time shaving hurt terribly, but after the subsequent ones you don't feel that it pulls out the hairs at all, epilating unevenly, unfortunately, which is associated with more frequent shaving cool is a massage cap which, in my opinion, reduces the pain such a shave takes some time, there is no fluidity for one hair sometimes you have to do some approaches :) But it's certainly better to shave than a regular shaver or wax patches. One more disadvantage is that it works terribly loud. Also, there is no way to shave in the evening when children are sleeping: )"
3626,"To make sure we are not convinced that such high raises are an exception, CheapHotels.org reported a price increase of 1075% during the Munich Champions League final between Chelsea and Bayern on 19 May. It increased the price from the standard 85 euros to 999 euros per night for the Munich hotel Maria Munich . Bookings in Munich hotels for the Champions League Final on 19/20 May 2012 as of 9 May 2012 . CheapHotels.org presents the lowest prices in available hotels with a standard of at least 2 stars in a double room, located in city centers, on particular match days."
3627,"The hotel itself does not deserve 4 stars. Instead, the staff deserves 1 star. Only guests from abroad are treated well here. We were all pissed off. Cleaning the room was limited to filling up the tea bag! The reception did not react to the attention of the guests - both to the ""complaint"" made by e-mail and personally. Our room was supposed to be available from 15:00 (exceptionally late) and they didn't work out with it either. The swimming pool, when they arrived we were temporarily closed, and this was one of the arguments to choose this hotel."
3628,"I usually wait with an opinion about the hotel to check out - unfortunately not for this hotel. The only advantage is the ladies at the reception. It's still only worse. The elevators are lame, even the corridor is not quite clean enough carpet. The rooms are already worse. The bathroom is just dirty, the towels in a strange way make it clear that someone used them in front of you and were not properly washed. How can you ask for rooms after renovation . The bathroom is much better, cleaner. The restaurant is a failure. The dishes served are not enough of what we order, the price for them is definitely inadequate. The waitresses looking down on the client as if they were still alive in the 80s. Breakfast at the hotel is another failure. Terrible scrambled eggs and coffee probably bought and used twice for one cup. Breakfast saves only a set of fresh fruit and a set of sweets as someone likes. In general, I do not recommend a hotel whose 4 stars is a definite exaggeration."
3629,"Wonderful stay in a beautiful large living room with bedroom, very clean. You can prepare food, attractive price, very nice owners, the best location as a base for trips to the mountains and close to attractions such as the Wild Waterfall, Wang Temple, the queue to Kopa, Hotel Gołębiewski. Close to the restaurant. We will come back and greet you from Dzierżoniów! ! !"
3630,"Unfortunately, she was very disappointed with this doctor. Maybe it was a matter of me going to him with my daughter ( 5 years old ) at the NFZ. The rude doctor, for a good day she heard that I have to put the child on a chair so that it wouldn't accidentally drop something from the desk or from the shelves. He did not listen to what she said to me, he interrupted. The daughter had a suspicion of an oversized almond - a continuous cold, a blocked nose. The nose doctor didn't look at all, looked at the throat but didn't look at the third almond and found that everything was normal. Three weeks later, another laryngologist, found that the almond is remarkably oversized, we have a referral for a removal procedure. Never in my life has I felt so drenched as by Dr. Babinski. I don't recommend it."
3631,"We went to the sauna with a friend after skiing. Well, I was disappointed. There was no door to the sauna room, i.e.. there was, but from Mr. Rescue, I found out that they are deliberately open on the doorway to the noisy recreational pool because ""the castle broke down"" (by the way, I guess quite a long time ago because it was all rusty). Lack of the possibility of closure caused further difficulties such as children running around the sauna, pouring water from the showers, screaming, additionally entering the sauna (despite the reservation in the regulations that the sauna for adults) - rescuers did not have any control over what was happening there. No shelves for water, no trash can, and worst of all, no sauna culture. Aquapark also without revelation . Generally I do not recommend ."

3634,"Prophylactically, I went to see the doctor (from time to time I feel pain in the stomach and liver area). The family doctor suspected gall bladder inflammation. For all peace of mind she decided to consult with a specialist. Unfortunately, the first visit consists of entering my data into the computer, prescribing a prescription and making an appointment for the next visit and examinations. For this you pay 100 PLN . The most important point of the visit is to convince the patient to do a set of tests on the next visit, which bagatela cost 600 zł. (colonoscopy, gastroscopy and ultrasound. You know - they won't hurt. He could at least do an interview with the patient, do an ultrasound or improvise some tests - t"
3635,"A great disappointment from the very moment of the bus's arrival at the hotel. You know the feeling? The bus takes people from the airport one by one and you always think that your hotel will be the best, that you have made the best choice: - ) And here's the button! You can see that the old guy from the travel agency set us up, we spent a lot of money for a two-week holiday for a family of four, the more regrettable it is because my first choice was the Mitsis hotel, which turned out to be better than Esperides. Already at the entrance, old, wiped-out carpets and sidewalks are a real nuisance. The reception and lobby has no exit to the garden, to the swimming pools. The biggest advantage of the hotel, i.e. the view is closed with a glass wall. The rooms are small and tight. Small, shallow! The swimming pools, the crowd in the water, people are choking like sprats in a can. O 5 . 30 start to the pools to occupy the sun loungers, although most of them have been occupied by towels with German inscriptions since the evening - ""this place is occupied"" - the hotel does nothing about it. But the biggest complaint is that the hotel completely murdered the Greek atmosphere. Previously we had been in Greece many times - on cheap trips in the 80's, in cheap hotels in Rhodes, in more expensive destinations but we always felt that we were in Greece. This is where the hotel slaughtered Greece. They often caught us laughing, but where are we actually? The mash, the food is fast food with a nod to the English; beans, bacon, fried eggs, frits, fish fingers. No Greek atmosphere, the hotel could be anywhere, the Greece here would not feel. To this baptized drinks from the liquor, expensive and weak wi - fi, weak beach. My husband rightly said that this is a hotel for workers from England. I would definitely not recommend it. Our Esperides has so effectively alienated Greece that we choose Turkey instead of Greece. The standard of hotels is much higher, the rooms, swimming pools are of a higher standard, the boarding is great. Just more for less. The Greeks have been spoiled by tourism for over a hundred years, they have noticed how at first they always ask where you are from and if the tables are allocated, you always get worse than the Germans, even though the Poles also leave tips. I do not recommend it."
3636,"All the fears have been dispelled. We found ourselves in renovated rooms on the 3rd floor. Clean rooms, bath and shower in the bathroom. Very good food, large selection of dishes. Drinks and alcohols to the resistance from 10 to 23! The pool is cool, with slides. Close to the airport, but we and our friends were not disturbed by the taking off planes and a quick transfer from and to the airport is a huge plus! I recommend it!"
3637,"Hotel for a typical overnight stay. No luxuries, but at a very good price. Too much I can't write because the hotel was only 23 to 5 - I didn't use em for breakfast, I didn't manage to check out Wi - FI. There are basic channels on TV. Separate shower, separate toilet. Wash basin in the room. Mattress in bed pretty hard. Generally clean. Very nice and helpful service."
3638,"I strongly recommend Mr. Peter ! He very competently explained to me the condition of my spine and made me aware of the consequences in case of changes. Mr. Piotr is a professional, he has great knowledge, but what is equally important to me, he has a great approach to the patient - he is nice, open and communicative. She started my rehabilitation under Peter's supervision and I am convinced that I am in good hands. The therapy applied and the accompanying exercises help. The pain passes. I feel better and better. Thank you very much Mr. Peter! I recommend this physiotherapist to everyone! Marta"

The visits to Mrs. Psychologist in a way put me on my feet, allowed me to look at the problem ""systemically"", gave hope and conviction that everyone has the right to their own happiness. Mrs. Psychologist awakened in me the will to ""fight"" for my own IAM and the motivation to act. I appreciate Mrs. Ursula's high commitment and individual preparation for a given patient problem. The cooperation with Mrs. Psychologist takes place in a very nice and warm atmosphere. In my opinion, Mrs. Ursula is a great specialist (performing her profession by vocation)."
3640,"In 2013, recommendations on vitamin D supplementation for Central European residents, including Poland, were published . They were developed by an international team of experts chaired by Dr Płudowski. ""The recommendations were developed for all age groups - from pregnant women to newborns, infants, children, adolescents, adults and seniors. We also included people from special groups at risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as obese people and those working night shifts"" - explained the specialist. Thus, the experts recommend giving 400 international units (IU) to children under 6 months of age, i.e. 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day; toddlers from six months to 12 months of age should receive between 400 and 600 IU, depending on the amount of vitamin D in their diet; children and adolescents under 18 years of age should receive between 600 and 1000 IU, depending on body weight, throughout the year if adequate skin exposure to the sun is not ensured during the summer months. Adult doses have been set at 800 - 2000 IU, depending on body weight and all year round, if from April to September the proper skin synthesis is not ensured. In pregnant women, vitamin D supplementation at doses of 1500 - 2000 IU should start no later than the second trimester of pregnancy."
3641,"The fetal heart echo examination lasted about 10 minutes, price 300 PLN. Mrs. Dr. Dr. is quite sparing in words and emotions, but I hope that she is actually a good specialist and those 10 minutes were enough for her to have a good look at the baby's heart. As for me she doesn't have to be friendly and smiling, it's important that she is a good doctor and that she knows what she is doing and what she sees."
3642,"Already at that time the director of the hotel Michael Goerdt announced that after the completion of the renovation Bristol will become the most luxurious facility in Warsaw. However, there were no public announcements of changing the brand from the current Le Meridien to the elite Luxury Collection. Was it Starwood's response to the announcements of new shareholders located in the neighborhood and competing in the first half of the twentieth century with Bristol, the European hotel, which began operating in 1857? Let us recall that in mid-September the owners of the Europejski hotel, which has been closed down since 2005, located vis a vis Bristol, informed about the planned modernisation and signing an operator agreement with the luxury hotel chain Raffles Hotels & Res about"
3643,"I've been treating myself since I was a baby since I was 28 and I'm pregnant. I have a progressive visual impairment (currently - 7), so during pregnancy she wanted me to perform an examination of the fundus of the eye in order to exclude retinal defects and possible certification of indications for the caesarean. The doctor's examination did not say that she had made indications for the caesarean, but she added at the end of the visit that God's weapon should not close my eyes during childbirth because I may lose my sight. She also demonstrated the position I have to take during the birth and said that I should exercise because I still have time. . . After this visit she went to another ophthalmologist, who did an examination of the bottom of the eye, which looked completely different from the doctor's and it turned out that I have such a weak retina that I can't have a parent naturally."
3644,"Horror. She was in a private office once to confirm a diagnosis made by someone else. Mr. Doctor accepts with the help of several assistants and assistants, there is a lot of noise around the visit and each - as she saw m - patient is sent back to adjacent rooms for sets of all possible examinations. I got m from the place of referral to a few that didn't seem to have anything to do with my condition. Because financially she was rather prepared for an appointment, so she asked me what the cost of the tests would be. It was obviously huge. She pointed out to me that I only had the amount of money I had in the day and the amount of money that Mr. Dokrot had been wronged by and for the research that did not fit in with the amount of money he had put out a referral. For example, he said that a throat smear must be done on an empty stomach (a moment earlier I was supposed to have this examination done on the spot, so if I paid for it, there would be no question of an empty stomach). She saw that other patients, without exception, are also referred to all these examinations and perform them with lunacy in their eyes. At the end of the series, I was also directed to a dozen or so nasal physiotherapy treatments and, in my opinion, by assistants, pushed to make an appointment for the whole series. She left me with a huge disgust and zeroed out of money. Initially, with the feeling that maybe the doctor was right and you have to treat yourself comprehensively, but after absorbing it, she knocked me on the head and the next day she called me back, giving up on the murky treatments. And all the luck, because it turned out later that a surgical intervention was needed, and if I had stayed there, maybe I would have inhaled there expensive. Generally speaking, an efficient and well-organized machine for taking money out. In my opinion it is suitable for the intervention of the Medical Chamber."
3645,"More ! The lease expires in 36 years. In 1999, the city of Gdynia leased for 50 years to Echo Investment SA of Kielce the property of Ejsmonda 1 Street, the so-called Polanka Redłowska . Echo undertook to build a luxury hotel with a restaurant and a water park. Although the investment was to be ready in December 2001. Although the investment was to be ready as early as December 2001, until 2006, when the company and the project were bought from Echo Investment by Dariusz Guzek, owner of, among others, the Velaves hotel in Władysławowo . According to the plans presented at that time, the hotel complex was to consist of a five-storey hotel with approx. 25 thousand square metres of usable area and approx. 300 rooms, a congress centre for 1,500 people and a water park with swimming pools, slides and saunas. The cost of the project was then estimated at approx. 60 million euro ."
3646,"Hello, everyone. I don't feel like judging your entire career as a doctor, but only your experience with him. In March, I had a knee arthroscopy after the twist and during this procedure the reskinning of the medial condylar baptism. Apparently, the resection was minimal but 2 m - ce without putting any strain on the limb. Rehabilitation was not effective. Of course, the doctor claimed that everything is okay and gave a suggestion that I do not think I am doing the rehabilitation. Now I am after the visit to Dr. Domżalski and after the MRI. The effect - two foreign bodies in the knee, marrow inflammation and an irregular edge of cartilage. So my assessment of this doctor is very poor. Maybe another person helped me, however, by not referring me to the MRI (from him) and insisting on further rehabilitation. Greetings to all the patients and wish them a return to health : - )"
3648,"Usually I write reviews at the end of my stay, but here I can't help but notice - not even a full day has passed and I'm already enchanted by this place. A quiet, peaceful place. The decor of the hotel deserves appreciation - wooden interiors, full of compositions of dry flowers or other products of Polish folk art (for sale of course). The service deserves praise - nice, competent. The rooms are clean, neat and, what is most important, they smell pleasant, do not smell of chemistry, for the first time in my life I meet such a case. Restaurant menu - quite rich, something nice for everyone, very decent in price. The quality of served dishes is very high - I have no reservations. Buffet breakfast - delicious (especially cold cuts, sandwich pastes and salads) and fresh. In the restaurant available billiards and darts - evenings will pass quickly. Cheap beer. : ) The only downside (light) is the availability of TV channels (half of them do not work, but maybe it's only in my room - I'll ask my colleagues) and WiFi, which is not a speed demon, but you can work on it. The overall good impression these two small details do not spoil at all. I hope I will still have the opportunity to live in this place - it is on my private podium of the most pleasant hotels in Poland. Greetings to the entire crew. Keep it up, it's great! : )"
3649,"We spent two nights in that palace. Fortunately, only two. Maybe I'll start by describing the room. The room was renovated a long time ago. Old furniture, carpets and wallpaper that scares and does not decorate the room. To this you have to add a squeaky floor throughout the room. In the bathroom the shower was sticking out of the wall and it was hard to wash underneath. The cleanliness of the room left much to be desired. There were only about 6 guests in the palace at that time, which was probably the reason why there was only one person in the hotel staff who worked at the reception, made food, served it and cleaned the rooms. He hasn't met with something like that yet. As for the food, it was virulent. The property of the palace was terribly neglected. The grass wasn't mowed for a long time, and it was on our knees. Pathways overgrown with moss and weeds. I thought that at least the nearby lake would delight us with its charm. Unfortunately, the descent to the water was overgrown with tall weeds. To the description I attach photos . I strongly advise against staying in the palace in Maciejewo."
3650,"""Our problem is that in our research we have to combine clinical knowledge with knowledge of acoustics, psychoacoustics or sound propagation in the human body"" - says Dr Nowak. He admits that it is difficult to find a common language in this. ""For example, the doctor tells us that in the acoustic signal from the stethoscope it is important whether he he hears any whistling. But we have to find out what kind of whistles he is talking about and examine what characterizes these sounds"", says Dr. Nowak. Dr. Nowak reminds us that today, with the help of a stethoscope examination, doctors initially detect e.g. heart murmurs of newborns. Only 40 percent of children who were referred for further examination are confirmed to have significant disorders. ""I know what parents experience when they wait with their child for a cardiologist's examination. My daughter was also wrongly suspected of having a heart defect on the basis of a stethoscope,"" admits the acoustician. She adds that due to the imperfections of the device, the opposite situation can also happen: there are no defects in children, who should be treated further. According to Dr . Nowak's opinion is that the effectiveness of these preliminary tests could be improved by modern devices which he is developing."
3651,"She's been treating me for a year with monthly visits to your doctor. It is hard for me to refer to specific methods of treatment, because she had me simply prescribed a medicine (Izotek) and monthly visits, which in fact were not very stroke and lasted up to 5 minutes (150 PLN each). For the visits every month she brought me the current results of the research, which the doctor noted. What I noticed and after some time started to be very annoying was the notorious delays. Often due to work I had to make an appointment for the first hour after opening and often the doctor was 30 - 60 minutes late. Of course I understand that maybe she was going from another doctor's office - it happens to every doctor, but it was notorious during regular visits, and my request at the reception desk for a phone call if we know that the doctor will be late (and this was always to be expected), because I was specially fired from work and had 2 minutes to the office unfortunately it was not used even once and so coming to the visit you wait about an hour for 5 minutes of conversation. Of course, in further consequences, the waiting room was already waiting a few people for their visits, and the doctor is missing. The medication was suggested during the first visit and the doctor did not look at my complexion for a year, the whole examination consisted of looking at me from a chair, with an average good light, they only had the form of an interview. I put up a neutral, because it seems to me that the doctor is not quite able to give the right amount of attention with a large number of clients / patients. The delays, with all my forbearance, started to be very annoying with the constant repetition. The price is quite high. It wasn't bad, but I didn't feel any outstanding care or commitment at the meetings, and I really wanted help and professional advice with my problem."
3652,"Very good location of the hotel. Having many business meetings everyone easily came to me . Nice atmosphere in the lobby, all the staff helpful and kind. Especially recommendable business lounge. Concierge Catherine greeted me and my business partners with a smile and immediately offered coffee. Also a great tribute to Mrs. Grazyna and her team who has always been helpful. The only thing I would have reservations about is too little Polish food at dinner. I was also surprised that only beer and wine are served. The rooms are very comfortable, a comfortable bed. A minus for too expensive Wi - Fi ."
3653,"I've read all the opinions about you, Dr. . To be honest, I have mixed feelings, too. I gave birth to my first child, I went to see Mrs. Dr. all through the pregnancy. There were visits, that she answered questions, had time and was kind, but there were also visits, that the examination lasted moments, made me feel like I was working here for punishment, and I'm just an intruder. . . . .she was able to pick up the phone during the visit and talk in private, although I think she's at work and shouldn't do that. . . . . .we are only human and we have the right to have worse days, but you also have to respect the other person, because that is what personal culture and professionalism requires, in my opinion. It certainly saved many people and helped others. This is really our choice of who we go to, so let's meet first and then judge. Greetings to all the ladies: )"
3654,"Nice, objective doctor. He explains calmly and takes the patient seriously. It's hard for me to judge if he helped me because I was one time. A little hesitant about the delay of treatment but maybe my case is not clear. I recommend it and I'll come for a follow-up visit. It inspires confidence."
3655,"The advantage is that the rooms are really big : ) Unfortunately, the rooms are suitable for a decent renovation, they are old and not a bit like Novotel's in Warsaw. Upon arrival in the toilet she saw the remains of the previous users of the room, which proves that the cleaning lady was not even interested in cleaning the toilet. Checking out was at 12 o'clock and when we were leaving at 11 o'clock. 50 We heard a phone call from you at the reception that you should check out. For the future, I advise you not to call ahead of time and not to admonish the guests because it was very rude to drive us out ahead of time. Unfortunately, the service has failed us and we will not visit this hotel again; )"

3657,"I strongly advise against it. Here is an example of what breakfast looks like. And a grain coffee, tea or water. For dinner yesterday we got a spoonful of pasta, and for the second course, WARNING half a sausage and a few slices of Al Parma ham and two tiny buns for four people! ! ! Only after a row made by our guide, the kitchen saved itself as much as it could. On the platter there were fries (in cold meat!) and a rocket with grated carrot. I do not recommend ! !"
3658,This is definitely not a hotel for young people. The staff looked at us crooked every time they showed up at the pool. All inclusive only 3 alcohols and drinks are of low quality. The hotel photos are generally Photoshop . We also found a mushroom in the shower. The food is very average but fresh - the hotel does not have its own kitchen. Plus for cleaning every 2 days and change towels.
3659,"By participating in the study, participants will gain knowledge about the processes taking place in the body during pregnancy. They will learn, among other things, about changes in the symmetry of their body, breast size, amount of adipose tissue, skin colour or even voice colour. The program also allows to monitor bone loss during pregnancy, which is important in the prevention of osteoporosis. Researchers ensure that such an examination will be simple and safe - women will have a heel ultrasound. In addition, women will also be tested for oxidative stress levels. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between antioxidants and free radicals formed in cells. Too high a level of stress is harmful to mother and child . The milk test, in turn, will provide information on the nutritional and energy value of food . Researchers ensure that all the studies are without influence on the course of pregnancy and are harmless to the health of mother and child. Participants are guaranteed full anonymity and all information is used exclusively for scientific purposes. The programme has received a positive opinion of the Lower Silesian Medical Chamber."
3660,"Super rooms, well maintained, air-conditioned, top-notch service, nice, always ready to help and advise. We especially liked the kitchen, each meal was prepared with great attention to detail. At breakfasts always fresh bread, tomatoes and other rarities. An additional advantage of the extensive SPA menu, where therapists advised on every issue of choosing the right treatment. We are delighted, we will certainly come back often! With pure conscientiousness I recommend!"
3661,"It would seem that the hotel is simply part of a large global chain and thus similar to others. However, I visit it regularly and with every visit I find that it is a place with a soul. This soul is the responsibility of the wonderful staff with Mr. Dariusz Napoleon at the helm. Such an individual approach to the client, as in the really good old days, maybe he did not even meet me in the whole Poland. It started once with a single breakfast and ended with a very beautiful cooperation, which lasts until today. What I can especially recommend is the cuisine - really great. What is most important for me is to organize really unusual romantic evenings for my Beloved Wife and for me. We have spent many beautiful romantic moments there with the most important person of my life. And all thanks to the individual approach to the client."
3662,"After a few visits to another gynaecologist, who didn't like me. After - for the time being - two visits I am convinced that I want to lead my pregnancy with Mr. Doctor, I am not maybe some complicated case, the pregnancy is running properly for the time being but it is very important for me that Mr. Doctor devotes enough time to me during the visit, analyzes in detail the results of tests, answers all the questions and simply inspires my trust. And the visits took place at an agreed time for which there is also a plus!"

3664,"I don't recommend it. even though I don't recommend a sympathetic doctor. I went to see the doctor because of very high d - dimmer was suspected of thrombosis. I went privately to make it as soon as possible.the visit lasted about 10 minutes, including 2 - 3 minutes of ultrasound done just like . Before the start of the ultrasound the doctor said that there is no sign of thrombosis on my legs that these high d - dimers are the result of the cancer that I just have to find where my legs are bent. The fact that the fact of thrombosis was not found because she went to another doctor for a consultation who first had the ddimers repeated, which surprisingly turned out to be normal and were probably elevated from a severe injury that she suffered a few days before the result . Also I do not recommend the doctor did not help me and even hurt me because I panicked unnecessarily, which did not have to happen."
3665,"The second stage of the Warsaw Mummy Project will consist of taking samples from the mummy - however, as the researchers reserve, everything will be done without damaging the exhibits, using laparoscopy. Thanks to them, it will be possible to carry out thorough laboratory analyses, including genetic ones, using DNA tests. ""We are honored to contribute to this fascinating project. Gaining knowledge about the types of cancer that occurred in antiquity, the organs that attacked and the stages of disease development can make a significant contribution to improving today's methods of preventing and combating cancer,"" says Andrzej Radkowski, Medical Director of Affidea Poland, which is the exclusive medical partner of the first stage of research under the Warsaw Mummy Project."
3666,"We jumped out for dinner at the Krasicki Hotel. We know the hotel and we didn't have a bad feeding experience. The hotel itself is very charming, decorated with flair. Today's dinner at the restaurant is unfortunately a great disappointment. Tiger shrimp appetizer prepared for the crumbling pap, smelly old fish. The main dishes - beef sirloin and duck, made an impression of not fresh ones too. The service was nice but what about it . Big disappointment ."
3667,"A beautiful hotel in a beautiful place . Besides, a farce. At one point we couldn't believe it was really happening! The hotel good starts at 15. At 00, we arrived around 16. 30 . We were still waiting for a room because it was not clean! ! Apart from us there were 20 more people waiting ( up to 2 hours )! Poķój , although for non-smokers he had a cup of pet food on the terrace and smelled. The staff had to clean it and ozone it. The restaurant was expensive and tasty. We ate in a self-service bar, but for wine we had to wait 30 minutes because no one of the waiters dared to approach . Eventually the plates that could not fit on the table started to be cleaned by ourselves. When the next order was placed, the waiters completely forgot that it was done, so after 20 minutes of waiting they gave up on the table. Toilet paper in the toilet next to the restaurant is missing, there are no free spaces for spa treatments (as well as the spa). The Internet sometimes works, and phones to the reception desk - not at all. The only thing that was great was the masseuse you met on the street, who gave us fantastic advice on what to see and do in the area. The four-star hotel, however, is one big failure."
3668,"It's 2:00 in the morning when I write this review. Already once she drew my attention to the reception desk that it is loud. Now again some screaming. She got me a room on the ground floor, everything's going to be terrible. As I try to fall asleep I read the information on the leaflet that lies by the bedside: ""Our priority is to give our guests a peaceful sleep. Well, I guess not! I am very understanding and patient. I don't even draw any more deficiencies in the room or bathroom, but sleep is very important for the guest, for me, because tomorrow. . . . .means today I have to get up and work. It's a pity that the hotel didn't take care of such a basic comfort as a peaceful dream: ("
3669,"The hotel is wonderful, nice rooms, clean, daily cleaned, air conditioning, towels, hairdryer, TV, large number of swimming pools and aquapark, animation at the main swimming pool, huge selection of food, several restaurants, everyone will find something for themselves, to that thematic evenings. For me the weakest Chinese restaurant Golden Sun. Beautiful greenery. We lived in the Satellite area, which is a little bit away from the main part but it didn't bother us at all, 5 minutes on foot and it was in the centre, for the lazy people there are melexes that will take you where you want to go. The service also deserves a special mention, always smiling and helpful. In this hotel you can really relax and have a good time, everyone will find something for themselves, a lot of facilities for families with children, but for those who want to take a break from the children also such as a swimming pool and a bar for adults only. The downside is the not very nice hotel beach, narrow and by the shore there is a strip of stones on which you have to go to the sandy bottom, without shoes to the water you can not. But the hotel rewards the minus. In a word, I recommend"
3670,"Plus: A small hotel in the forest, with a wonderful view of Kazimierz. Minuses: Dark and cramped rooms, the smallest shower possible, a husband 180 cm was not supposed to move there. A very nice terrace, but connected to the neighbor's terrace, without any feathering, so as if we were taking part in a party on the terrace. The pool is dirty, no service. We bought the stay with dinner - two small soups and two second dishes to choose from, served to the table without any extras. No appetizers, dessert or drinks. Dinner room for 460 zloty - an absolute grant for what you get on the spot. Two kilometers away in Janowiec, there is a choice of bars."
3671,"The patient said during the conference that she feels fine now. ""She's getting better every day. As everyone tells me, you need time and a lot of patience. It takes time to get used to it. It is known that it is not the same as it was before, but I think that with time all these scars and wounds will heal so much that it will look so good that it will not bother me"" - said Anna. As Professor Maciejewski recalled, in such cases the most important element was time - from the moment of the injury to the restoration of circulation in the replanted part of the body. However, thanks to quick intervention and diagnostics of the team from the Wrocław hospital, the patient was transported by helicopter to Gliwice . Tissues were also properly protected (cooled to 4 degrees Celsius) and transported."
3672,"A doctor worthy of recommendation. My opinion is based on one visit. I was with your doctor in order to consult my results and take into account the opinion of several doctors because I met with different diagnoses . The doctor conducted a very thorough interview, analyzed the results of the tests, recommended additional fairly accurate tests (as part of the package LUX MED did not regret my referral to an MRI of the pituitary gland - significantly increased prolactin, another endocrinologist from LUX Med decided that there was no such need and he was wrong, the test showed adenomas). I think that the doctor is very professional and trustworthy, especially in endocrinological and gynaecological issues. He gives very precise recommendations, he has to examine frequently the changes in the level of hormones after the drugs and make regular visits. The doctor's diagnosis turned out to be correct and the offer of treatment coincided with the recommendations of the doctor with whom I decided to stay permanently. As far as the treatment of the patient is concerned, I think it was neutral, neither particularly nice nor inappropriate but professional. If it hadn't been for the fact that another gynaecologist - endocrinologist bought me with her approach to the patient, I would have been calm in terms of content if it was Dr Podsiadłowski who treated me."

Nothing else worked but the antibiotic (other doctors prescribed masks, made to order liquids and nothing had any effect: even a smear I made privately, for which I have ... The doctor took a look and said that such bacteria always occur in the sprays. She was right. ) Actually, express visits, but I always got the answer to every question I ask. I have recommended Mr. Bielanov to some of my colleagues. I'm satisfied and cured of the horrible thrash. Thank you, Eve!"
3675,"Course: physics I and II, lecture and exercises [ / b ] One of the best instructors. The lecture is interesting and full of jokes and anecdotes. The exam is terribly difficult, but there is no problem with passing the exercises. On wheels you can basically download, improve infinitely - you can not even go to the colloquium and then write at your assistant's office ; ) I recommend, I recommend, I recommend."
3676,"We had a 10-day stay in a room with a balcony. Upon arrival and check-in at the hotel we received a room with a view of the interior of the building, where there was a canteen. The room we got shouldn't be for guests only as a repository. The window in the room did not open and all the time the air-conditioning had to be in the room. There was also no sunlight. They went back to the reception desk to clear up the misunderstanding and you confirmed that this is our room for max 2 days. She went to your manager and forced me to change the room for the next day. In addition, we had dinner bought, and during the first meal we were refused. So again we went back to the reception desk to explain the situation. In exchange for the confusion with the room and the meals, the manager gave us free drinks for lunches. The hotel is unfortunately weak. She found me a fly in the breakfast sausages and got me a spider's tea in the bar. Breakfast is not very varied, dinners are good. Tomatoes with hard skin as on bull's-eye, sausage also poor quality. The waitresses after the guests from the tables were sweeping with a brush to the dustpan (how can I be sure that this brush does not sweep the floor?) From the fruit virulent only oranges, because peaches and plums very hard. They save on food. The barmaid was probably unhappy that the hotel guests interrupted her in playing on the phone and lying on the couch. Her attitude was very unprofessional. The rooms were cleaned, towels changed, carpet in the rooms dirty and poured. The sheets on the beds were too short and they were pulled down at night. On the first floor of the rooms, the staff of the hotel have to be working and there was a lot of cigarette smoke in the corridor. It is forbidden to bring food to the rooms under a 50 euro penalty. The pool is small with cold water but clean. The location of the hotel is good because outside the center and in close proximity to Nesseber. We did not meet the ladies at the reception to speak Polish, the Russian language prevailed, English was also a problem to get along. In general the hotel is poorly managed and this can be seen at every step. Wifi works poorly and only in the lobby. They bought us wifi for the room, but it did not work either. There are many better hotels for this price, which unfortunately we do not recommend."
3677,"Bathroom - curtain in the tub . Water is poured outdoors and the bathroom is all swimming. TV - picture on the pictures, voice check, tragedy Internet - interrupts, so poor service has not seen em for a long time. I advise against staying in this hotel for such a rate. I do not know what these 3 stars for."
3678,"The hotel is located on a headland, surrounded by greenery and beautiful gardens. We were there in early August so the weather was perfect. Hot sun and clear sky without clouds. Warm water. Hotel very nice, clean. Rooms not big but comfortable. Bathroom clean, lots of towels. The food is very tasty, everything is a lot and when something ends up, they'll soon add it. The service is courteous and even without knowing the language you can get along. As such they understand in Polish: ) . A lot of tourists from Poland . On the beach deck chairs, mattresses and umbrellas. The place is for everyone . Two bars, one at the beach and one in the garden. The hotel is far from the city, there is no shop or ATM but we didn't care about it. If someone wants to rest from the hustle and bustle of the city, this place is perfect."
3679,"This hotel is in an excellent location. Its staff are very friendly and helpful. We had a room for passers-by which was beautiful and the beds are very comfortable. The only thing I can drop off is the food on the children's menu. There is no good choice, but on the plus side they allow you to order a pizza. I recommend this hotel."
3680,"I was at this doctor's on a 3D ultrasound examination (which costs a bit of money), I am very unhappy with this examination, Dr. . He insisted that the baby didn't weigh enough for the 20th week, I guess 10 minutes I tried to make him realize that it was the 19th week, already when he came out of the gainet he said that it was the weight for the 19th week, there was no point in further discussion. She had the impression that she was looking for some kind of defect in my child, and when she asked me about the sex of the child, he said that he saw nothing. He had the test repeated in 4 weeks' time only for what if everything is ok."
3681,"We're just after the visit to this facility. The resort itself is not so bad, but the rooms in the owners' building are of a very poor standard. The owners themselves do not make contact with guests as if they were not there, unless it is about food, it is a parody of mass catering, a Swedish table or a meal for an extra charge, it is so miserable that it is a pity to spend money I do not recommend this place."
3682,"Within the group, the economic segment was growing faster than Upper & Midscale, with not only All Seasons brand, but also Ibis and Etap hotels. A detailed list is presented in the table. The All Seasons brand, which was established in September 2007, is the only non-standardised brand among hotels in the economy segment in Accor's portfolio. Other non-standardised brands include Mercure ( Midscale ), Pullman and MGallery ( Upscale ) and Sofitel ( Luxury ) . The lack of strict requirements for hotel furnishings and decoration, as well as probably favourable settlement rates between Accor and hotel owners, are the main drivers of the current dynamics of All Seasons. This is because it allows independent hotels to join a large international hotel group on a franchise basis and benefit from the advantages of the reservation system without incurring excessive costs and loss of individual character."
3683,"We were at the hotel restaurant for dinner. From the moment we entered, you can see a great commitment of staff and professionalism. The decor is pleasant, very clean. Menu varied . As an appetizer was served a melon ball in truffle sauce with capers, a surprising combination of flavors. Dishes very nicely served . Mushroom soup is a sensational, very essential and light at the same time. The goose is crispy but not dried out. We enjoyed it very much. We recommend it for family dinners."
3684,"After a lot of resistance (she also read me negative comments about the doctor, but I guess that's what they say about each of them) ...at the instigation of a friend, she went to Mr. Peter and was pleasantly surprised by his approach. He is a nice, objective man with a great sense of humor, which greatly facilitates contact with the doctor and improves the mood in such intimate and often embarrassing matters. And most of all, a good professional who has diagnosed my problems and helped me to solve them. That is why I honestly recommend Mr. Peter. I think that the opinion of others is important, however, to make up any opinion, it is best to just go to the doctor."
3685,"The Doctor's very nice. It was my first visit chosen thanks to the opinions of a well-known doctor.pl I was not disappointed. I was very sympathetic to the patient, I explained every doubt and perceived the problem broadly, i.e. not only gynaecologically, but also endocrinologically. During the visit, I did not feel embarrassed at all, there were no unnecessary questions, only specifics. And at the same time, the visit in relation to other specialists at an attractive price. I recommend it with a clear conscience. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Unfortunately, the next time I visited in March, I was very disappointed, because I was after the procedure and the doctor did a review in 2 minutes without saying anything. If she hadn't asked questions, she wouldn't have received any answers or information what to do next and how to proceed. I understand that there was a delay in appointments of more than 15 minutes but the patient pays and wants to be served properly. Unfortunately, as I had a good opinion at first, so after the next visit has changed. In addition, the Doctor claimed that I don't have erosions and the doctors at the hospital said that I have very extensive, so I guess it's probably the Doctor's whole rush that makes a lot of things go unnoticed. I don't want to fall into the competence because I think that you are certainly a good doctor, but rush is not a good advisor and you can quickly lose the same patient."
3686,"Maybe the main building is ok, but our package got rooms in the building above the canteen. It's absolutely not a three star level. The rooms failed. Second and third floors without elevator. There's no sewage or no water coming out of the shower. The air conditioning is not working. Walls greased with extremes (really, no lying and no joking). Canteen's modest, but the food's fine. Beach service available. Hotel surroundings cleaned, nice service. Internet available only at the main building reception. Due to the disastrous conditions in the rooms, our entire ten-person group is to be moved to the main building, but for the time being we only have it promised. They would give me one star rating, but I want to be fair, because apart from the rooms, the rest are on a medium level. That's why two stars. A small place, rather for the undemanding. Nice is the neighboring Icmeler."
3687,"I don't recommend Dr. Highlander to anyone. He shouts at patients, shows his changing moods, complains that he has to write prescriptions and referrals (I don't really know who would do it if he is a doctor) and enumerates the number of times they have been with her during the year (i.e. how many times they bother her). My dad went to this lady for a dozen or so years, how seriously he fell ill and had to do tests more often, she suggested to him to change his doctor, which he also did. Fortunately, he found a person who knows what empathy is and does not get rid of seriously ill patients. I wish Mrs. Góralczyk that someone would treat her like she treated my dad. . ."
3688,"All right, I recommend the hotel, a stop right next door, where you can get to the eastern station and from there you can get to the market square. I rate a double room: a comfortable bed, a working TV with a wide choice of channels, clean and fragrant. I definitely recommend it, because it is really cheap in relation to quality!"

EATING - First of all, everything is served COLD, the heaters were switched off or there were no heaters at all. - cardboard sausages, plastic sausages - we were hungry - we had to eat out2 . ALL - INCLUSIVESIVES in this hotel has "" all - inclusive "" All alcohols are based on OUZO, you ask for a brandy with coke, you get an ouzo with coke,, diluted beer, wine from cardboard - tasted like a Polish jabol.

We had the impression that by pouring us beer in a 200ml cup they have us for an uninvited guest, and yet they paid us a lot for this and that. 4 . The hotel beach is also open for guests from outside. Greek girls with dogs came to the hotel area, there is no fence from the beach, anyone can enter it, 0 safety. 5 . The terrains of the hotel are wandering around stray dogs and cats. There were so many dogs that you could not go for a walk at night on the beaches, because there were a dozen or so of them. Cats in the canteen and restaurant! They even jumped on the tables behind the food. 6 . The water in the pool probably flows from the mountains (in this village, water is free from the mountains). I conclude this after the icy water, which was difficult to enter. The water in the sea was several times warmer. The pools are empty. 7 . The bars were closed at the discretion of the staff, the schedule was not adhered to. 8 . ANIMATION and peace of mind, they just weren't there. In the evenings nothing happened, at 21:00 we went to sleep because there were only mosquitoes outside. The views were beautiful, but for this money we could admire the same in another place in decent hotel conditions. We complain about the hotel."

""The establishment of the Faculty of Medicine is the result of the persistence of many people from the world of science, politics and business, who have contributed to the construction of our university building. Now we can wait for October, when the first students of the Faculty of Medicine will start their studies within the walls of our University"" - emphasized the Rector."
3692,"Celiac disease, known as visceral disease, affects one in a hundred children. As Natalia Drabińska, a PhD student from the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn, explained to PAP, it is an autoimmune disease caused by the presence of gluten in food. In the patient's body gluten causes inflammation of the intestine, atrophy of the intestinal villi, which reduces the absorption surface from the intestines. The visceral disease is incurable, it accompanies the patient throughout his life, there are no medications for it, no surgery is performed, the only way to treat it is to apply a restrictive, gluten-free diet for the rest of his life, which will alleviate the effects of the disease such as chronic inflammation, absorption disorders or vitamin and mineral deficiencies. ""Through the use of prebiotics we want to improve the general health of children with visceral disease"" - emphasized Natalia Drabińska."
3693,"For a hotel with 4 stars and room rate average. A very large hotel with average service from the reception desk to the bar with creams and disco.

For over three months I have been losing weight with Mrs. Agnieszka Midek and the effects have exceeded my wildest expectations, she has already lost 15 kg! She has put together a very interesting diet tailored to my personal preferences, taking into account my numerous allergies and health problems, and really did not have an easy time because I am a vegetarian with lactose intolerance, and all of this I have to deal with psoriasis and coeliac disease. Despite so many restrictions, her menus are interesting and very varied, I don't eat alone every day, and I feel very much better and I have eliminated many skin problems after eliminating harmful products. I really recommend to visit Mrs. Agnieszka, she is a dietician with a lot of knowledge, creativity, she is a great motivator and leads the whole weight loss process. It is really worth it!"

I'm treating for hypothyroidism and my appointments for over a year looked like this so that I entered my office, the doctor peeked at the examination, prescribed another prescription, took 100 PLN for a 3 minute visit and goodbye and as a result no improvement. Luckily, I decided that I couldn't go on like this and I managed to find the super Doctor (found on this portal in the dark thanks to opinions) and now I have a comparison of how different the treatment may look like."
3697,"For starters, the hotel is well located, not far from Poznan, Srem etc., it is easy to find. It is also cheap. The Spartan and, unfortunately, not the same equipment as described on the hotel website: - TV - yes, it is. But with a screen the size of a bigger laptop, - Wireless kettle - did not find 'em, anyway there would be no place to plug it in, because there is only one electric socket in the room, by the bed. And so I had a dilemma: laptop or charger? - The tower - it's probably about the non-functioning radio dummy? - Hotel towels - were ! - A refrigerator - maybe on the windowsill. But it only works in winter. On a hot May night I had no use for it. To tell you the truth, the room I occupied was only suitable for sleeping - there was a bed and a couch. Unfortunately, there wasn't even one chair, desk or bedside lamp. So you can forget about comfortable work. . . There was also no wardrobe for clothes, its role is played by a rotating hanger. Not very functional solution. Breakfast - to put it mildly - without revelation . Ready-made set - a pair of cold meat slices and yellow cheese . The only choice is a version with scrambled eggs or warm sausages. Lunch menu is much more varied, but quite expensive."
3698,"Optical methods for monitoring the brain use the fact that light can penetrate the skull bones to some extent. This is particularly true of near-infrared light with wavelengths between 650 and 850 nanometres (a nanometer is a millionth of a millimetre). The properties of the blood - specifically haemoglobin, whose oxidized form interacts with light in a different way than the reduced form - are important here. This phenomenon allows to assess the degree of oxygenation of the observed part of the body by analysing the intensity of light penetrating the tissue. The basic elements of optical diagnostic devices are small light sources (laser diodes) and sensitive photodetectors. Sources and detectors, usually 2 - 5 cm apart, are put together in pairs. The patient's head can be put into several to several such pairs at the same time, which potentially allows to examine a significant part of the brain."

The hotel is located 2 minutes from Piotrkowska Street, in the very centre of the city. The only inconvenience is the road works carried out in Lodz, which are not inconvenient for hotel guests (tight, well soundproofed windows). The big advantage is that you can tilt the window and let some fresh air in: ) The only reservations you can have for breakfast. As in all Novotels very unsavoury scrambled eggs, a small selection of cold cuts (there were no chicken cuts at all), a small selection of cheeses (2 yellow, no e.g. mouldy), at 10:00 a.m. the restaurant was short of bread (buns), although breakfasts on Sunday are served until 11:00 a.m. The bread was supplemented at our request. Small portions of a'la carte restaurant dishes, although very tasty. From the hotel 4 * required to have more rich breakfasts and restaurant meals. Internet access very fast, easy to use.

3708,"Hotel Krasicki is a very good place to relax. The castle, or rather a bailey, is impressive, it is huge. The hotel combines tradition with elements of modernity, rooms in Gothic style and more. Nice bathrooms. Very good breakfast, decent SPA. Notes: definitely to improve is the confusion with additional cards for bathrobe and towel - it should be organized differently so as not to burden the attention of guests. In the bathrooms poorly with the offer of cosmetics - in fact, there is only universal body gel and hair, there is even a lack of body lotion - as for a hotel of this standard is something really surprising, seemingly a trifle, but still. In the dinner package customers should have a choice between a buffet and a dish a la carte. A lot of people at dinner, the staff can barely keep up. The rooms have a surprisingly small TV."

3710,"She had the opportunity to go for a walk in the ibis in Katowice Centrum with her friends on the last weekend of September. The price thanks to an early booking was 49 PLN per room. Close to the city centre, the hotel is rather small but spacious, rooms in ibis standard, without reservations as far as equipment is concerned. Unfortunately, the first thing that surprised me was the open soap in the room and towels (fresh) but in stains. Comfortable beds, no reservations. The staff at the reception should be there all the time, unfortunately after breakfast, the receptionist moves to the kitchens where she cleans with the rest of the staff. . . Only when she sees that someone from around the corner is looking for her, she appears at her desk. A gentle ignorance of the customer. I will definitely come back during my next stay in Katowice."

3714,"He didn't recognize my asthma. After pneumonia in 2014, I was coughing for weeks. At the visit, the doctor listened to me, said that everything is fine and that such a cough has the right to last for some time. The doctor prescribed me a cough inhibitor. Unfortunately the cough persisted, so I went to another doctor who also said that after such a serious illness such a cough may persist, but not longer than 3 meters. This doctor carried out a thorough interview, among other things, he asked about allergies and asked me to come back after these 3 meters. On the next visit he gave me a referral for spirometry, which unfortunately confirmed his asthma suspicion. To sum up, she felt I was being treated in a steamy way. I understand that today, many patients (especially those who have subscriptions in private clinics), come with the proverbial aching toe and head, but this does not mean that everyone."
3715,"We went to Astor with a large group, we booked five rooms, I must praise the people working at the reception that they helped us a lot in choosing the rooms next to each other. There were a lot of children with us and here deserve special attractions: swimming pool, animation, gym, playground. As it happens at our Baltic Sea, for a 7-day stay, it rained for 4 days, so if there were no attractions for the little ones it would be a disaster. Very good and varied breakfasts. I agree that from the outside the hotel resembles the times of communist Poland, but already inside everything is ok. The minus was the paid parking, which we were not informed about at the time of booking, but we managed to negotiate a lower fee so I generally rate the hotel at 5."
3716,"If somebody thinks that you can buy good quality goods in Chinese, then I must disappoint him. The Durasan Bergen Open NS 90 cabin is not cheap at all and with such a price you would expect to get at least a medium shelf product. The cabin is very carefully made and disappointed by the low quality of the materials used, which seem cheap and somewhat tacky at first contact. The shower handset hose supply connector is poorly made of plastic and after passing through the glass, there is about 4 mm of thread left for screwing the hose and after putting the seal on it is definitely difficult to install. The holder for the handset is not adjustable in height and someone over 1,7m must bend over. Attention is drawn to the shelf, but also here the manufacturer showed off his lack of attention to aesthetics.

3717,"PAP's interlocutor tells us that in the German uDISCO method, mouse bodies are first fixed so that, among other things, the cells do not degrade. Then a mixture of chemicals removing blood, water and fats is fed into the bloodstream. However, if these elements are already removed from the body, the body must necessarily shrink. In the case of the uDISCO method it reduces its volume by up to 65%. Fortunately, however, all tissues shrink evenly without changing the proportions. ""Such tissue shrinkage can be a great help for scientists - a smaller body is easier to scan under a microscope,"" explains Paweł Matryba. The biologist points out that the whole process of body preparation in the uDISCO method takes only four days. Meanwhile, the histological examination, which prepared subsequent tissue sections, may have lasted for months. Scientists using the uDISCO method will thus be able to study certain processes much faster."

She listened to me and even though she tried very hard to help, she could not diagnose a simple ailment (carpal tunnel syndrome), despite the fact that I had typical symptoms. Instead of quickly implementing a treatment that would improve my condition, the Doctor recommended that I change my sleeping position and change my pillow and did not recommend further examination.

Mr. Braszkiewicz advised me to stop taking drugs because they are expensive and in Western Europe they are not cured for increased prolactin. He advised me to see how I will feel without taking drugs for hyperprolactin . I was very surprised by such a different opinion, so I decided to listen to Mr. Brashkievich. I thought he might be right. The prolactin level had risen considerably and I felt bad. I had to start the therapy from scratch and I had to start with another really good endocrinologist and now I've got it all normal. The question is, is Mr. Braszkiewicz a good doctor? I doubt it."
3729,"I would like to thank dr Marcin Czternastek, dr Michał Cibor and dr Pietras anesthesiologist. On 20 May 2016 at St . Luke's Hospital in Tarnów of the year I had a spinal surgery (vertebral column L4, L5 7mm) Although the damage to the spine was very large and threatened me with leg paralysis, the surgery was carried out effectively. Thanks to that the pain disappeared and today I am able to move on my own. I would especially like to thank Mr. Dr. M. The fourteenth man, who was my attending physician, introduced me to the whole course of the operation, allayed my fears and fears of the surgery. His kind approach to the patient, his calmness and composure made me feel better."
3730,"Although Accor added 266 hotels with 38,085 rooms in 2012, this did not prevent it from making the biggest cut in its history, with 910 hotels and 81,000 rooms down. This is a result of the sale of the Motel / Studio 6 chain operating in North America. As at December 31, 2012, Accor's portfolio comprised 3,516 hotels with 450,487 rooms as compared to 4,426 hotels and 531,714 rooms a year earlier. Overall, the chain recorded negative growth for the first time in years, reducing the number of hotels by a fifth (20.6 percent) and the number of rooms by 15.3 percent. . Such a large decrease is mainly due to the sale of 1102 hotels with 107,347 rooms operating under the Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands (economic and economic extended - stay facilities) for USD 1.9 billion to the Real Estate Partners VII fund belonging to the Blackstone Group."
3731,"I don't often get to write opinions, because I just don't feel the need, but here I couldn't help myself. First of all, what we see on the Internet, i.e. pictures full of colors showing very interesting rooms - it's nothing but photoshop, rooms in reality ugly, but this is not the worst in my opinion. The whole hostel stinks! ! On the cages the smell is the same as in the hospital, but in our room there was a disgusting stench of chemicals. Despite the fact that it was outside - 6 degrees we were forced to leave the windows open and escape for a few hours. Only after the air was ventilated did it work somehow. Toilets were uninteresting, dirty. In the morning there was no water in the toilet in the corridor or in the shower that was in our room. At every exit you have to leave the keys to the room at the reception and sign the regulations that we agree to allow employees to enter the room during our absence. Luckily, it was only one night because I have no intention of repeating the adventure with this hostel."
3732,We were with our husband in Borowy Manor in July 2016. We really enjoyed it. We highly recommend . The food is very good . Rooms with mountain view . Very clean . Nice service . Close to Term . Nearby bus stop for people who want to take another ride .
3733,"German B 1 / E on average for hedgehogs It's up to you - if you know the language and enrolling in the course is just a formality, please do not learn anything in class, even if you want to. The advantage is that you don't have to go to the class (but you can also enroll in an extracurricular course, what not?). A nice man and so what? ? I don't know, I haven't learnt anything... . . .it was a pure waste of time for me. . ."
3734,"Hello, please help me, I really need a phone number for the doctor. My boyfriend urgently needs a consultation with a good haematologist and Dr. Krysinska from what you write here is a great doctor. I'm looking for all sorts of ways, but I can't find any contact anywhere except in my mother's field, I'd like to know if she's taking her private life. Thank you very much."
3735,"We spent 5 days in the hotel and it was very pleasant. The service was very nice and friendly. We were shocked to see the size of the rooms are really spacious. Very carefully cleaned rooms. The food was very good especially the breakfast as it was very hard for us to get out of there. The swimming pool was very pleasant at times, there was a shortage of sun loungers but generally also a plus. Other attractions were not used by us because we lacked time."
3736,"Hotel: nicely renovated, not with some craze but is neat, clean and nice. Rooms are decent, comfortable beds, quite nice bathroom. The room has a refrigerator, coffee, tea, clothes dryer on the balcony, hair dryer, TV, fan and air conditioning. The surroundings of the hotel are also very nice, the views are lovely, to the beach one way or the other not far away, the swimming pools are varied, three on the adult zone and one upstairs accessible to all, but I did not meet up to have someone to ask good children to come out of the pool 18 +, anyway the kids preferred to play upstairs on slides. The service was wonderful, all very nice, helpful, talkative. Animation on a medium level, but maybe also because they did not have any great equipment to use. But sometimes you could even smile on the evening animations, humor, but not for everyone (subtext 18 +) . Drinks are also very good, to choose from to color, they did not regret the alcohol if someone wished (they called it Polish drink ; ) ) . It is worth to go on a tour of the island - although it is relatively expensive, you can see a lot and take a ride on different means of transport, it would be difficult to organize such a trip yourself and the price would be similarly as not more expensive. However, the biggest profession was food, unfortunately not much local food, you could eat different kinds of paella every day, but it was one bigger plate, really. There was one day ""Spanish"" but I don't know, maybe I expected that if it is Mediterranean cuisine then it would taste like Italian, here unfortunately somehow these things didn't work out, I don't know maybe it was about quality? She was also counting on tomatoes - I thought we have better in Poland. The food was more customer-oriented from England (beans in tomatoes for breakfast) or the French (a large selection of sweet rolls and yeasts, tasty anyway). Good bread. At the end of our stay, when you came about half an hour after the start of dinner, there was not much food left. I do not know what has changed because earlier it was reported on an ongoing basis and the last two days were not so good. So mainly for eating only 3 stars, but for us it was an important aspect of the trip."
3737,"She made an appointment with the doctor after being recommended by a friend. A very polite and competent man . The amount of time he spent on the examination and questions about the disease showed that I was taken very seriously. But most importantly, the medication she got and the information about what to do and how to take care of her skin with changes gave great results. She had previously only been treated with various ointments and creams and this doctor recommended me as the first oral treatment with tablets. The result is so good that I decided to comment on this doctors on this page. Greetings. p . s . I VERY RECOMMENDED"
3738,"Hotel and basically a castle on which there is a great place very charming by the river. Rooms are a different fairy tale :) and in fact no fairy tale would be useful to renovate the rooms and bathrooms and equipment, but you can not have everything. The hotel service makes up for the shortages: )"

3740,"I feel cheated by the Rainbow office. The room marked as standard in a 5-star luxury hotel turned out to be a clinic with an extra bed in the form of a field bed located just above the hotel entrance, at the public transport bus stop. And all this is reportedly in accordance with the contract. We were informed in the hotel that it is possible to exchange the room for a standard extra bed but for an extra charge of 20 EUR per day. We made a complaint accepted by the resident and ... paid us. When we returned home, we made a written complaint that was not accepted by the Rainbow office. RecommendationsWhen buying a holiday from the Rainbow office, think carefully about whether the agreement guarantees the comfort you expect by suggesting a standard hotel room."
3741,"I advise against it. This doctor is incompetent, dishonest and dangerous. First of all, he ""detected"" in me the supervision for which he deleted 700pln, it was in 2004! 3 months earlier another gynecologist of this great supervision didn't see it, then I thought that this other doctor is not an expert. Secondly, during the pregnancy, when I forced him to do it, he was defending himself against being discharged from the National Health Fund. He told me that from such studies it is only jaundice that can be caught! Besides, during one of the visits, okay. On the 16th week of his pregnancy he ordered a colonoscopy for 150 zloty (it is not allowed to do this in pregnancy!) and on the next visit he simply forgot about it in the world, which proves to me that he wanted to drag me. And the worst thing. 24 weeks after the pregnancy he ignored the inflammation (even though I was with him) and a day and a half after the visit I gave birth to him as a result of an infection due to inflammation. Let everyone draw their own conclusions."
3742,"Unfortunately, I agree with most of the negative opinions. We've been to your doctor a couple of times because there were no places for others. Of course, she had a homeopathy, which only made my daughter's condition worse because she had to give up other drugs, and the child was feverish for a week and did not give antibiotics, (I know that abuse is harmful, but she exaggerated the other way around). When she called my doctor for a home visit it was in shock how the child could be treated in such a way, and we almost got to the hospital. Moreover, she wasn't very polite, her daughter kept howling at her and she didn't let herself be examined, which doesn't happen after the change of doctor anymore. Mrs. Dr. She often visits the television, probably because she has few patients, because she sits in the kitchen all day long and when she looks at the Internet she has the most free places."
3743,"A room with a higher standard and a shower with fittings, a cable with electricity in the wardrobe hanging, not prepared on time. . . If you choose the offer, pay attention to check-in from 17:30 and check-out at 10:00 - I have not met with such a system. . . Very weak organization at full occupancy. . . . . Food is regular, but the restaurant is too small. . . Cafeteria chaos, long waiting times and promotion for a drink but in a café in another building you'll find out about it with a payment - mastery of anti-marketing. . . The pool towel will be picked up at the spa which is on the other floor, the pool is open until 21 but the towels are not coming back because the spa is 20 : 55 closed, wet you take to the room. . . for me, I don't get much. . ."
3744,"And you know that these columns have voices with PLASTIC baskets? No - it is not a casting or even an embossing from sheet metal . . . . . .it's platinum. Painted with some kind of silver plated to pretend to be aluminum. Whether it's bad or good, I leave it to my discretion. When reading from their data sheet a great bandwidth, pay attention to the fact that this is the bandwidth for - 6dB while other manufacturers give the bandwidth for - 3dB . This is a big difference in my opinion so that the less conscious customer will be able to get a better idea of the band. . . ć . This should basically end the discussion about buying - not buying ."
3745,"A hotel with a particularly pleasant intimate atmosphere of its own. Situated in an original spa villa, very nice interior design, nice and professional staff makes sure that guests feel comfortable. The rooms are very nicely decorated and very clean. Breakfast is delicious, a large selection of tasty products. The hotel is located in a park on a hill overlooking the mountains / I recommend rooms on higher floors. The hotel has a restaurant with an interesting and good menu. Tasty desserts. This was my second stay in this facility and it is a good choice. I highly recommend the facility for a romantic trip and more."
3746,"Hello , She would like to thank me very much for a very successful stay at the Hotel Kiston . She spent a very nice time with her family in Kashubia. There are many attractions for the children of the younger and slightly older. The swimming pool, sauna, bowling were all the time at our disposal. A great attraction for children and adults were horse rides which were conducted very professionally and passionately by Mrs. Alice. Eating is something crazy, every day a different theme dinner. You could see the freshness of products from which the meals were made. There was only one downside to a rather spraying waitress with glasses. She was very unpleasant, not knowing English (her husband did not speak Polish). She had no idea about the card. When my husband and I came to dinner in the evening, she couldn't recommend anything to us, propose or advertise a dish."
3747,"This inconspicuous hotel is a pleasant surprise. Inside we will be welcomed by a small reception and lobby with a small terrace ( patio ) . Elevator will take you to small but nice rooms where there is everything you need, a very soft bed, a lot of cushions, TV, light adjustment. A big shock to me about the bathroom. With a similar solution so far, I have not met em (after returning to Poland, it turned out that Puro Hotel in Poznan also introduced it). Namely taking a shower, the only possibility to cover the room is the curtain from the side of the room but note: whether the curtain (curtain) is covered or not is decided by the person who is in the room. What is it for? I have no idea. For couples it doesn't matter, but for people who are just getting to know each other it can be a reason or an excuse to peep or something else. . . . . . .hmmmmm. The location of the hotel is quite good, in the back (on the way to the Centre) there is a beautiful climatic High School which is surrounded by a million bikes, after going down we have a view of beautiful green trams. To the center is about 15 minutes walk and to the Old Town about 25 minutes. In general I have very positive memories of the price I will not say because fortunately the cost was covered by the company."
3748,"The hotel is an independent apartment, but clean and comfortable. The helpful staff, you can communicate in English. The hotel is located in a quieter district of Prague, close to a shopping and business centre, close to metro and tram stops, and you can walk to the Old Town and the Mala Strana in 20 minutes. The kitchen is fairly well equipped, but there are some dishes missing, the bedroom is fine. Interesting staircase, quiet elevator. Before you get to the hotel you have to make an appointment to collect the key to the apartment."
3749,"In general, stay in Qubus hotels I judge very poorly. Why? Making reservations on booking.com I chose options with parking, which turned out to be at 23:30 when I arrived, that there is an extra charge and if I have a problem with this I can park on the streets. Earlier, there was no talk of paid parking on the site. Since 23rd you will not get any more, and the bar is closed. The bedside lamp has not worked and the door to the bathroom has not closed. Normally such things don't impress me, but for a room costing 300 pln you expect something better. I'll probably never stop there again."
3750,"A very good and caring doctor. She got to your doctor at the end of 7th month of pregnancy, with symptoms of hypothyroidism. The previous doctor ignored them. Dr. Kucharski recognized them immediately and had them examined. He led my pregnancy to the delivery. Before the delivery, he predicted complications which could have been caused by hormonal disorders caused by abnormal thyroid function. His predictions proved true. Thanks to the fact that he had referred me to the hospital earlier and that I was cared for, the doctors could make a quick decision to have a caesarean section, which saved our child's life. I highly recommend your doctor."
3751,"Hotel in the center of Wroclaw - very close to the Market Square. Nice service. Clean and fresh . Unfortunately, this place is completely discredited by the nightmarish finish and decoration. Cheap, shiny and ""after the cheapness"" . Curtains, bedding - all made of Chinese plastic. It was a bizarre discovery under a sheet of flattering oilcloth! Fortunately, we noticed it before we went to sleep. . ."
3752,My impressions are not the best. As for a four-star hotel I expected 'em to have a higher standard and a climate that makes them feel like a desirable guest. The impressions from the website are better than what we see in reality at the hotel and in its immediate surroundings. Especially unpleasant impressions are made by the trashy baskets in the park surrounding the hotel.
3753,"For a business meeting for a manager who has no exorbitant expectations can be. The hotel clearly needs refreshing, especially that the price does not knock down (price - quality). The service is nice, pleasant and helpful. Kitchen . . . . So many changes are needed here, a soup, chicken fillet - dry sole - to spoil the chicken, it is already a college driving school."
3754,"This is the first time we've been here, but not the last time. It was wonderful! A comfortable room with a bathroom and a huge bed. Wonderful equipment, perfect arrangement of the object, lots of beautiful receipts and a well-kept humming brook. Spa treatments were wonderful, a wide range of treatments: everyone can choose something for themselves! ! ! Nice swimming pool and Jacuzzi with hot water to relax after a daylong walk in the mountains. We recommend it to anyone who wants to gain strength and"
3755,"Another ( 6 - you ) stay in this hotel and the least successful. The room on the 8th floor with an intensive post party stench, despite the open windows. After the intervention, the room is replaced on the lower level . Generally, the hotel is focused on large tour groups, which is best demonstrated by the design of the renovated restaurant - but it is a matter of taste. The higher floors require urgent refreshment - from dirty carpets in the corridors to sweaty linen in the rooms. The advantage is the favourable location, nice, although not always competent staff and quite large parking."
3756,"Nice reception and nice service. Unfortunately, the enthusiasm ended after entering the bathroom. Tiles on the walls popular in the early 90s, the stench of swamp from the drains and the ""smell"" of chlorine after turning off the tap. The real circus began, however, when it was time to sleep. After unfolding the sofa (supposedly a 4-person room, one double bed and a fold-out double sofa) it turned out to be nothing more than the well known from the 90s - these field bed - a frame made of steel tubes and on them pillows. You don't have to go on a walking pilgrimage to Czestochowa - the desire to sleep on such a bed is a real penance. With each even the slightest movement it squeaked mercilessly, and the straightening of the legs was associated with the process of folding the bed. The real climate of Częstochowa night was given by a nightclub just below the hotel, which in combination with a leaky window turned out to be a psychiatric therapy worthy of the ""Mechanical Orange"". I do not recommend to people who look for accommodation with their families after a day-long sightseeing to rest for one simple reason - to sleep there is NO DA. In addition, breakfast in the hotel restaurant 50zł per person (on the card in the room to order a sandwich and / or eggs + coffee / tea). In the offer there was a whirlpool bathtub - after asking where you can use such a bathtub because in the bathroom there is only cast-iron lady at the reception desk asked the question with laughter."
3757,Hotel for 2 stars. The bathrooms in the rooms are terrible . Very small and there is mold on the walls of the shower. In our room the door from the balcony was broken down and as a result there was noise and heat flew out into the room very quickly despite air conditioning. The food is not the best either. Not much choice . The bar is equipped with alcohol of very poor quality. I absolutely do not recommend this hotel.
3758,"Unfortunately, not much good can be written about this hotel. You can see that there is no good attitude towards customers here, rather it is a masquerade attitude. The prices are not low at all. This is the only hotel that does not immediately offer a room with two separate beds when booking a business room for two people - you can only express such a request, but even though it was written in the reservation at the beginning we got a room with a friend with one double bed. After the intervention at the reception desk, we were exchanged for a room that was not very different from the previous one - it was very small, and the distance between the beds was about ok. 10cm. There were no sockets at the beds - you couldn't recharge your phone with it at hand. There was also no room for suitcases or shoes - only under the bed. There was no room for cosmetics in the bathroom, not to mention the fact that there was no place to put clothes on after changing clothes and they landed on the floor where they were soaking. . . There was not even a toilet brush in the toilet. . . The restaurant had a burger, but the breakfasts didn't knock it down anymore. Despite the great location, which is undoubtedly a great advantage of this hotel, I will not return here and do not recommend it to others."
3759,"Hotel belonging to the group "" to refresh / renovate "" . Clean rooms, but requiring renovation. The most annoying nowadays - the lack of an outlet near the bed. Restaurant - for breakfast ok, but completely not for an evening dinner or drink - a complete lack of climate. Nice service."
3760,"This year's performance of hotels in these cities, which is worse than the average in recent years, shows this. In the case of three cities: Opole, Szczecin, Olsztyn, in the years 2007 - 2012 the potential of the hotel base decreased. This is related both to the aforementioned changes: a new smaller facility replaced the older one with a larger number of rooms, as well as to modernisations during which hotel rooms are increased at the expense of their number. E.g. in Olsztyn two 4-star hotels have arrived, while two one-star facilities have disappeared."
3761,"My husband and I went to the Stary Browar Hotel to celebrate their wedding anniversary. The hotel is beautiful, climatic and very tastefully decorated. Nice and helpful service, which does not happen so often in other hotels. Great breakfasts. Not only that tastefully it's a very big choice, so everyone will find something for themselves. We took advantage of the attraction which is a beer bath and we liked it very much. The rooms are clean and neat. Next to the hotel there is a restaurant and a company shop where you can buy beer produced in the brewery. We strongly recommend a romantic trip for two : )"
3762,"""In other people, i.e. those who have not had a heart attack or stroke, or diabetes with complications or kidney disease, a 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular diseases should be assessed using SCORE tables (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation)"" - emphasized Prof . Broncel . It depends on whether someone has high total cholesterol and LDL, whether they smoke, how old they are and whether they have arterial hypertension. For example, a person who, according to the SCORE table, has a 10% risk of dying within 10 years is classified as a high risk of heart attack and stroke. Such patients should have a reduced LDL level of at least 50%. Cigarette smokers are also more likely to have a heart attack. ""A 45-year-old man who is addicted to nicotine should remember that his heart is the same as that of a person in his 60s,"" stressed Professor Broncel ."
3763,"However, in the 2000s the use of Revenue management ( RM ) in the hospitality sector did not prove as effective as expected. Today it is already Price Management (PM), which is better than revenue management because it is based on several factors and not only on the capacity of facilities. In the near future it is expected to integrate Price Management with multiple systems and a more CRM-like approach, which hotels will need even more in the future. Hotel Revenue Management has not always been a simple matter due to a huge number of factors that must be taken into account: location, seasonality and current season, number of hotels in the area, customer profile."
3764,"As a dermatologist, the Doctor is a very competent person. The medicines prescribed have also had the desired effect so far. However, I have a lot of regret for the doctor when it comes to the surgery. During the procedure, the doctor informed me that if I am not satisfied with the effect you can always laser repair the damage. However, for the next visit to your doctor I will not choose. And the damage was repaired by another doctor after the first stitches were removed after 8 days and I was forced to sew it again."
3765,"A few years ago he bought 'em Amica equipment, after that he promised 'em himself - never again! He broke em however and bought 'em a 625s hood. It was a mistake, the equipment looks nice but the quality is worse than Chinese. The first thing that came out was a plate on which the hood should hang - the rivets were cut. One latch at the outlet had a broken tooth - no wonder - a plastic element with a diameter of 1mm - bubble The height of the chimney eaves hood does not comply with the specification: it should be 94, 5 - 113, 5 cm, in my case max 107 . My hands have fallen off - it was really the last purchase of this company, I hope that I will be able to do this g . . . give it back. If not, I threw my money in the mud."
3766,"My stay in the hotel allowed me and my fiancée to relax perfectly. The spa and fitness area, room standard, room service and breakfast in the restaurant were on a very high level. The hotel is surrounded by forest on one side and on the other side there is a view of Jaworzyna Krynicka (the lower station of the gondola is 5 minutes walk). The fiancée had only some reservations about the service in the Institute of Cosmetics - she felt as if during the treatments she was treated a little ""from above"", and during the facial cosmetics treatment the diagnosis of shortcuts was carried out quite sketchily. Apart from these minor drawbacks, we remember our stay very well and we will gladly visit the hotel in the future."
3767,"A wonderful place to relax . Rooms are cozy, very tastefully decorated. Bathrooms are clean. Public kitchen and dining room well equipped - in addition to kitchen utensils you will find here coffee, tea or sugar. In the dining room there is also a children's corner with many toys and books. The villa is surrounded by a garden with barbecue areas, swimming pool and children's facilities - cottage, sandpit, bicycles, toys. There is a parking lot on the property. Quiet Corner is beautifully located, through the garden overlooking the promenade on the Soła River - a fantastic place for walks, while sitting in the garden you can listen to the sound of the river. Writing about the Quiet Corner you can not miss the owners, thanks to whom this place is so unique. We recommend it!"
3768,"First of all, the quality is completely out of date, the photos on the site of the object and other portals are out of date, and maybe even not very real, as if not from this object. A room for about 250 - 300 PLN / day, remembering the times of the People's Republic of Poland, as if nothing has changed since then. Old furniture, carpet in the room is dirty but rather old. The bed in the room is massacred, I think that the mattresses have not been replaced since the beginning of the object's existence, they are simply worn out and faded in many places. In the room itself the pros and cons are missing and the cons could be written out a lot. The bathroom is a total misunderstanding and like all the rest, it's falling apart from old age. No heating or air conditioning. The decoration of the building would also require refreshing . The swimming pool is very small, where a maximum of 2 people can swim freely, if nobody uses a water whip. The saunas are but so what if we were dining for 3 days, of which only once on Sundays in the afternoon were turned on, on Saturday the steam bath did not work the same way on Sundays to about 17. It would still have to be written that the spa area is only open from hours after noon probably from 17 - 21 all week long and on weekends all day long with a break of 1 - 2 h, and nowhere did I find such information. The hotel's reception desk has been notified of the fact that the offer we bought differs significantly from the one we found, and has received information that this is not the first such complaint and that if we want we can move elsewhere. And if it wasn't for the fact that we had to spend 3 days there in a rather sensitive period of 13-15 February . I'm sure I would have taken advantage of that offer. But unfortunately the seats were already taken . FRANKLY AND WITH CONVICTION I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FACILITY! ! ! ! ! ! Location of the object really cool close to the sea about 300 m and to the center also quite close. The staff trying as hard as they can, nice, friendly and friendly, unfortunately there are no more advantages. Normal breakfasts are not distinguished by anything bad or good, as in many facilities of this type."
3769,"The ""Hotel"" does not meet the standard three stars, the entrance to the hotel car park only at the gate is a cube, the rest of the car park covers the trail, the car park is unguarded. Double rooms in the attic are kitschy, the floor cracks at every step, hot water flies alternately with cold, which should be repaired before the arrival of guests. Towels are changed every third day, as recalled on the bathroom door. Polish public TV channels are not available, the TV remote control is handed over at the reception desk at check-in and should be returned at check-out / see sticker on remote control. Kitchen in this ""hotel"" is a total failure, raw to the trout is a slush of old vegetables, wet fries from balsamic sauce, breakfast is a separate tragic topic, with a rude service at the forefront, especially a tiny blonde by the middle-aged carcass, listening to private conversations, no culture. With warm meals for breakfast we found the only one on the cheap steamers, in / in the waitress de-stress, that ""every day is different"", read the old one from the previous day, such as old baked bread, be eggs in mayonnaise, two old apples and a sliced orange. In a word the service and decoration of the hotel as from the previous era, certainly not in the standard three stars. In plus you can count the reception staff, competent and helpful, but even this is not able to change the overall picture of the hotel and the ignorance of the rest of the staff."
3770,"Castle Ryn visited em during the expedition from Mrągowo to Mikołajki . While on the spot, he took advantage of the offer to visit the castle with a guide. The object itself looks magnificent and assessing its adaptation to the needs of hotel services we can put up a strong 4 . My evaluation will be subject to the expedition through the centuries, that is from XIV to XXI . Your guide during the more than an hour-long ""journey"" devoted quite little attention to the history of this object, focusing rather on curiosities and time of reconstruction. Walking through the corridors of the castle one could get acquainted with its hotel function rather than the historical part. Hence my average score ."
3771,"Reading some reviews I can see that people have five-star requirements at a three-star price. . . I think that for this amount everything is perfectly organized and good enough. The food is on a high level, especially breakfast and dinner. Lunches are actually more modest and if someone has a mannerist taste then they may actually be disappointed but I don't think the two soups, the children's dish and the two main ones with compote are a hint for this resort. There is a different menu every day which is also important. The rooms and bathrooms are modest but clean. The pool is clean and warm! A playground for children is also sufficient. Additional activities with a nice girl . Older kids may get a little bored, but it's only a minecraft in their head anyway. . : ) The staff is very nice and helpful ! ! It's not true that someone is bullied there. Everyone is smiling. Fitness and aqua with trainer Wojtek revelation. Really professional! A guy who's specific and nice. In fact, thanks to these activities I didn't have time to get bored and the day was fast and nice. I recommend the resort because for this money is really OK."
3772,"This thing bought 'em in Saturn at the Citi Center gallery in Poznañ for pennies, and I wish I had bought 'em a beer for the summer barbecue. He called 'em this thing because the sewing machine doesn't deserve to be called that. It's a thread weave. I have two more archers, one from 1976 and one from 1983. Singer is 55 years old and this NOVA is probably 70 years old . They have poor functions, but with their necks like gold in full range . You can repair them all by yourself without giving them to pseudo-services where nobody seems to know the mechanics . So much for the subject . And I do not recommend the Overlocks of the archer because the guides and guides are made of bicycle spokes ."
3773,"The doctor is kind and polite on a private visit only. In the hospital, when you make an appointment for a particular hour you never keep your word, you have to wait ok . 6-7 hours until she remembers her appointment. The diagnosis was made 3 times, each time different, in each diagnosis she was 100% sure that it was this disease and none of them has ever worked. No interest in the patient. We are disappointed and disappointed that people like your doctor are supposed to help others if they don't do it. They destroy the patient's psyche without doing detailed tests to confirm the disease. I wouldn't recommend it, and we'll be avoiding the doctor with a wide arch. Lost time."
3774,"hello. she wanted me to add my three pennies to the opinion on dr. Bednarski. She got to him after gently speaking averagely performed breasts in another place . ""Something"" pushed me to repeat this examination somewhere else it is difficult to say what - intuition because nothing else comes to my mind. It turned out, first of all, that I have two changes in my breasts not one as described on the first ultrasound and secondly, that in my case the BAC, which was proposed by the first doctor, will give a reliable result in some 40%! To avoid boring, I will only write that thanks to Dr. Bednarski I had both changes removed at an express pace. Today she took away my results and I am happy. I want to recommend Dr. Bednarski to all women. I'm already his permanent patient and I'm going to run on the breasts every six months. Dr. Bednarski thanked me for the perfect procedure, the patience with which he explained to me that everything will be fine, that he is and that he is doing what he was just created for."
3775,"The visit was short, I was invited to the surgery on time, the doctor was kind, calmly explained the essence of my problem and confirmed the legitimacy of the operation, but I did not find out where and how the operation would take place, nor did I receive any written confirmation of the diagnosis or record of the recommendations. So after leaving the office I feel as if I was in an even bigger vacuum, unfortunately. 10 minutes is not enough for a comprehensive consultation."
3776,"I do not recommend this hotel. in the room: the lighting didn't work, in the bathroom, torn towels, the door to it was tarn down - paint removal. the room was spacious, but loud, plus there was a very large bed. The hotel restaurant was disappointing - the waitress without knowing the rules of service - she gave us warm wine, which had to be bottled by herself, as well as neither in a tooth of English - which I just needed, because unfortunately she invited me there her friends visiting crabs and for dinner she ate me mostly embarrassed, because the middle food, and oscypek with cranberries was brutally murdered by deep frying in deep fat. The only advantage is indeed the nice and helpful hotel staff (not the restaurant), but the rest unfortunately. . . . . . .never again."
3777,"He has been an owner of these headphones for a long time and I will say so at the beginning (for about 3 months from the day of purchase) everything was fine: P Unfortunately, after a long time the microphone broke off at the place of connection of the flexible cable, with the attachment of the microphone to the headphone (you can see it on the picture), then the volume control started to fail (but this is normal after a long time of use - the potentiometer is worn out), and of course the material which are padded headphone cushions is destroyed. The sound quality is very good, the microphone is also ok."
3778,"She went to Dr. Śmiertka for 1, 5 years a month and yes, after the first visits, she was delighted with her, she explained, examined, asked, referred to a number of examinations, she seemed to me competent. After half a year she started repeating the research and on each visit she repeated that the next time we are acting hard. She resigned because there was too much pressure to do the research in a folder and not where it is closer to home, and these promises. The rest of it annoyed me that when she needed the ultrasound examination she had to make an appointment for a completely different day to someone else, where the doctor does not perform during the visit."
3779,"Generally the radio is fine, but for this price you can buy much better radios. The big advantage is the design. Unfortunately, I very much lack the ability to set the treble, bass, and separate control of the subwoofer. I don't know what it's like with FM radio because I don't like listening to the radio. The advantage is that it is easy to install. There is also a lack of CD input, for me it is not a drawback because I do not use it but for people who only have CDs it can be a problem. Big plus - USB input, smaller plus - AUX. I think that the price of a USB stick today is so low (8GB with an OTG option for 13PLN) that any audiophile using a CD once can afford a stick."
3780,"""From ok. 120 years ago it was known that there are relationships between the human immune system and cancer. This was indicated, among others, by cases of self-healing of even advanced cancer. However, it was only for a few years that a huge breakthrough in research on this phenomenon occurred"" - explains Dr Zagożdżon . As he reminds us, until now the cancer was supposed to ""escape"" from the immune system, that it is still changing so as not to be diagnosed by it. That is why research has focused on methods to make the immune system catch up with the cancer. ""It's as if we're constantly pressing the accelerator pedal in the car, without knowing that we're also dealing with the handbrake being applied heavily,"" says the specialist. In recent years, however, it has been understood that the cancer uses other ways of defending itself against the immune system, using so-called checkpoints. They are used by the immune system to check whether the encountered cells are the body's own cells, or foreign cells or pathologically altered cells. ""It's like checking a passport,"" says Dr. Zagożdżon. Unfortunately, the cancer is learning to ""pretend it's not alien. ""Understanding this has led us to learn how to switch off the appropriate control mechanisms and it turned out that this way the immune system can be much more effective in the fight against cancer,"" he adds."
3781,"I've spent the last 8 months on MW2 and I'll compare COD Black Ops to it. First of all, problems with launching the game {console hanging } .

3782,"Even in pregnant women, sleep disorders in the third trimester can promote changes in the fetus's body, which after birth increase the tendency to be overweight and obese, as well as metabolic disorders and diabetes. Dr. David Gozal from the pediatrics clinic at the University of Chicago showed it on mice, but he claims it could be similar in humans. His research shows that sleep disorders during pregnancy inhibit the expression of the adiponectin-coding gene, a hormone that affects many metabolic processes, especially those associated with the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids. Therefore, the more it is in the body, the better because it protects against obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis."
3783,"The doctor was very unskilled, I came to her with acute pharyngitis, she couldn't talk to me, she just, she listened to me and prescribed a syrup claiming that everything was fine and it was a slight sore throat, when another doctor saw me the next day it was in shock that I have such lymph nodes enlarged and the day before that Mrs. Dominika didn't even check their condition and there was already an acute infection. It seems that in CMD doctors are the best in the capital city, unfortunately she has disturbed this pattern. I strongly advise against visiting"
3784,"The hotel has DAWNO years of greatness behind it! It requires a major overhaul and replacement of the management team, and the right one not ruling over the functioning of the hotel. But one by one: the location of the hotel is cool - calm and close to the center of the Golden Sands, so if the management of the hotel took advantage of this advantage, it could achieve an excellent result. But unfortunately. . . . The surroundings - the beach and the pool - drama. Both places are dirty, broken deck chairs, dirty umbrellas and a covered area. A path made of planks leading through the sand to the sea, with protruding, broken planks (I took pictures, I hope you will), rescuers are not interested in the flowing out on mattresses far into the sea. . . For the ""small salary"" they let in people from outside the hotel, who brazenly occupy sun loungers on the beach and by the pool. The hotel guests have trouble finding a place anywhere on the beach and by the pool. The pool is dense with dirt, the tiles with mould, and the metal frame around the pool is rusty (she took my picture). The rooms are cleaned every 2 - 3 days! Not every day ! Anyway, this cleaning is a mockery. Not once did not vacuum, the sand in the bathroom and on the floor, the beds were not covered, only buried (she also took my picture of the room after the so-called . cleaning). In the bathroom, mold on the tiles, and in the whole room a terrible smell of nicotine, not to be aired. It is jammed into curtains and furniture. If someone counts on a real all inclusive it will be strongly disappointed. In bars simple cocktails for an extra charge! They work from 10 to 22 . I asked for coffee at 9, 55 - the bartender requested a fee. However, they stop serving already 21 . 50 . The group of so-called animators deserves a separate attention. This is an absolute disaster! ! ! and embarrassment. With more unprofessionality and laziness she has not yet met me in any hotel. They came 3 times a day around the pool for (literally 2 minutes!), they played one and still the same song and performed reluctant limb movements, which according to them was called aerobics. And that's it. 3 times a week there was an embarrassing show for adults. They were contests on ""high"" level, for example, whoever was first to drink beer with a spoon. And the declared mini club for children - no responsibility on the part of the ""guardians"" . My friends escorted two of their kids (5 and 6 years old) to supposed art classes. There were two other children and a nanny bored with her work. When after an hour they came for the children, it turned out that their children are not there. When asked where they were, the ""babysitter"" answered that she did not know!"
3785,"My second visit to this hotel ended in disappointment. She lived in an apartment (room 15), whose appearance, unfortunately, is questionable as to the price she had to pay for the night. I understand that the hotel prefers the retro style but I don't think it's to stop years back. The floor squeaks, the bed also, curtains barely cover the windows, radiator grilles scare the dirt, and the joints in the bathroom also. Bathroom doors sloppyly draped with brown paint. The TV in the apartment is so tiny that it is barely visible. Definitely the apartment needs to be renovated or the price needs to be reduced because there is no luxury in it. Besides, in the restaurant, we waited 15 minutes for the order to be accepted, then another 35 for dishes that are certainly tasty, but the waiting time deters us from another visit. In the café she ordered m "" yoghurt shock "" which according to the description in the card was supposed to be with blueberries and was with blueberries which should also have an impact on the price because blueberries are cheaper than blueberries. As far as the pluses are concerned it is definitely breakfast, everyone should find something for themselves and here the 5 / 5 rating. Location also 5 / 5 . Reception staff 5 / 5 ."
3786,"The results of the report showing the costs of SM treatment in Poland were presented by Dr. Małgorzata Gałązka - Sobotka, Director of the Postgraduate Education Center and the Institute of Health Care Management at Lazarski University. She referred to the data of the National Health Fund (NFZ) for the years 2008 - 2016. The data show that in the analyzed period the average annual number of patients with MS was stable and amounted to approx. The average annual number of patients with MS was stable in the analysed period and amounted to approx. The NHF spent on the therapy of patients in 2008. PLN 137 million in 2008, while in 2016. - PLN 400 million . Average expenditure on a patient increased from 3.5 thousand PLN in 2008. - to over PLN 9.2 thousand in 2016. The percentage of patients for whom the NHF financed the therapy within the framework of drug programmes was approx.

The NHF spent on drug programmes in multiple sclerosis approx. In 2008, the NHF spent about PLN 74 million on multiple sclerosis drug programmes, and in 2016. - approx. PLN 312 million in 2016 . The average value of therapy for one patient was approx. 28,7 thousand PLN . Dr Gałazka - Sobota pointed out that the state finances should be looked at as a whole . ""Higher expenditures on the treatment of multiple sclerosis translate in the long term into lower expenditures of the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) related to pensions and social care, not to mention much higher quality of life of patients"" - he said ."
3787,"The hotel is clean, with a very nice area around the building, delicious food. There is also plenty of animation for adults and children. Although the animators are from the Italian network of Gio Party, but to take care of the children is employed Mrs. Asia, with whom our son fell in love: ) He loved all the activities she taught and asks for them even when he comes back home. The hotel is intimate and I strongly recommend it to families with children."
3788,"Hello, I went to see Mr. DOCTOR at ICZMP, apart from the specific jokes that he told me during the whole visit, he suggested several times that I should start private visits to him. Without showing any interest on my part, Mr. DOKTOR stated that he could not help me anymore because it was not within the competence of this office. And this is the doctor? ? ! ! !"
3789,"Mr. deocent is the best. I had a congenital defect. The docent recognized her on my first visit. He said that when he decided to go for a treatment he would be waiting for me in the hospital. I didn't want to believe it because the deadlines are long but he was right. I got into the hospital in 3 weeks. After another week, I left it. The other patients in the room waited a long time for their doctor's appointment, the procedure, etc. The docent is rude, but only when you ask him too many questions. He's just a damn thing, it happens. I didn't Nazley take his explosions to himself. Good advice - what can you ask your sister-in-law and what the docent doesn't want to answer. The professional is great, he undertakes surgeries that others are afraid of. He will always tell you honestly what he can and cannot do. He will inform the patient about the effect of the operation and the risks involved. But he will not say directly - this is how you have to deal with it. Always leave the decision to the patient, he will say yes: you will deal with it, you will heal it, the symptoms will disappear. You don't operate, it may paralyze you, but it won't happen too fast, it may not happen at all, but the risk is. The decision is yours. Some people don't like this style and they start to press the docent whether they are going to operate or not, then the docent gets nervous about him explaining the threats and the effects of the treatment and waits for decisions."
3790,"Being a runner on the road finally stopped me out of curiosity. They wanted us to eat something warm for a while and for that, plus. Three soups to choose from in cauldrons heated up like at a wedding. Still, it was tasty and it felt like it was made the same day. The downside is for sure the look of this restaurant room, the fact that at the bar behind the wall a woman smoked a cigarette (internal regulations?) and waiting endlessly for service, standing at the bar I was waiting for someone to notice me. A minus also for the price. Although by the route it is Rhyme, not Warsaw. 29 zloty for two ready-made soups and a few slices of bread (although delicious from your own baking) is a bit too much. I tried 'em, thank you but I won't stop again."
3791,"I know it's a low-budget hotel, but still, it's one of the worst things that 'em were in. The old rooms, they've been a little bit ruined. Towels look like they've been unchanged for 10 years. Rust in the shower and heavily dirty joints. For that kind of money you can try, but this is a weak hotel in an even weaker location. In addition, I asked 'em on the phone if I could pay at the hotel. The reception desk informed me that of course, and when I arrived on the spot I was told that there was no such possibility and that the money had already been taken off the account. A little unfair. From outside the hotel is also a bit dirty. It's cheap, but for 20 more zloty we have Ibis * * * . . ."
3792,"Dominika was given a m with lumbar pain, numbness in the right leg and hand and a stabbing between the ribs under the right shoulder blade that makes it difficult to breathe. I am a professional violinist, so this is quite a serious matter for me. After six visits I feel as fit as I've probably never felt before. Skiing (I'm after an accident involving a ski break, which caused my right knee to stop working for weeks) has never been so flexible and enjoyable (talking about turning both ways). I'll add that she was born with a skewed pelvis, which made her walk m . Now I'm supposed to finally walk normally. Mrs. Dominika is a person with extraordinary intuition and professional inquisitiveness, so that she is able to get to the real causes of the problem, and with knowledge to effectively remedy it. She is also a warm, cultured, cheerful, energetic, positively motivating young person. The doctor is most recommendable!"
3793,"He did what he was supposed to do, but I'll never again go or distract my friends. I was at his place in LUxmeda and he sent me to his place privately. . . . .everyone wants to make money ok. But neither good day nor goodbye. Mine and attitude as if he wanted and couldn't. In a private office, he had rusty tools and something that was done with a scalpel was done with knives. . . . . When 15 minutes before the private office visit was closed, my phone call with the question if the current visit was received for rudeness. . . . .he held me 30 mib and at that time he accepted another client - there was not even an apology. And the best part was the slice that I had to put on the bandage: ) ) ) she got a square cut out like this with a ruler cm by cm"
3794,"She used the WINTER FERIELS 2016 package. The programme provided for in the package has not been implemented. The programme of attractions on offer on the website and in the leaflet provided on the day of arrival envisaged : - family table tennis or billboard tournament in the castle cellars - NOT IMPLEMENTED - bonfire with sausage roasting (Mondays) - WITH TRUE IMPLEMENTED IN PART (no sausage roasting sticks) - activities for children with an animator, among others . painting pottery using the traditional stamping method, quilling - making decorations from paper strips, playing and playing ( Tuesdays ) - NOT IMPLEMENTED - "" Expeditions of Explorers "" - family fun in search of hidden treasure - NOT IMPLEMENTED - mornings with fairy tales in the playroom - "" Children's Castle Painting "" - fun with prizes - NOT IMPLEMENTED - visiting the Castle with a guide Food included in the package : excellent breakfasts (tasty and varied), dinners - monotonous menu, not suitable for children and people who care about healthy eating. Very long time of waiting for the dishes to be served to the table. Individual dishes served at large intervals. For this reason the time for eating varied from 1, 5 to 2 hours. (it is difficult for a child to sit so much time at the table) . OFFER NOT WORTH RECOMMENDING TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ."
3795,"I was saved here by a picture of a swimming pool but a massacre for me, there is a pool for 20 people for 200 overnight stays. The Internet is but in practice it is not. Nowhere to go after dinner there is only ping pong vegetation in the room asxktos no car is a lime tree. The food was given out small portions (dinner one was in a measure of ok but one ball of potato meat was small maybe with 100 grams and on a plate raw and it was supposed to be enough for 4 people where for me it was enough for max 3 hours, stiff meals for example 8:30 and the end is not there to eat you it will not eat you, the food is not added on the snoring. Everywhere you have to sign up for a pool this sauna probably everywhere you know life. . I'm sure I'll never come back here."
3796,"Before that, she had a heavy trolley that she had to carry on from the third floor. This trolley is very light and I can easily carry it myself. It is suitable even for the smallest baby because the lying position is really lying ! The foot protector makes the baby tucked inside the stroller, so the wind is no longer a problem. If there is a bigger wind, the wind protection foil is a great solution. In the case of the sun, you can extend the stroller and the baby's face is protected from harmful radiation. Now the minuses! The shock absorbers in this stroller suck . It is only suitable for driving on a level road. In case of a bumpy road, the baby wakes up and whines ( terribly shaking ) . Horror is with a driveway under the pavement . Also not very comfortable to drive . My husband gets crazy ! You have to put your foot close to the foot so as not to hit the wheels . And access to the shopping basket is tragic when the child is lying down . The shopping basket seems to be quite large but it is not. With poverty comes a foot protector, a foil and a bottle of water. The foam wheels wear out quite quickly and squeak with time. If she was to buy a pram now she would buy me another one. On pumped wheels and with good shock absorbers, because I will still experience discomfort during the walk, but the child does not have to bother!"
3797,"Well, many people always recommend this microphone for different headphones. I often see on specialized computer or audiophile forums, how people just this microphone often recommend to headphones of 50 or even 500 PLN. He wanted me to reduce all these false (in my opinion) opinions. Is the company Zalman paying someone to write nonsense under the title of great sound quality, very clear sound etc.? ? This microphone is a misunderstanding, like most that are offered at this price. I bought it myself because I was recommended it as a microphone for 50 zloty attention. . . I think my old no - name microphone for 10 PLN was better (and if it wasn't for the fact that he broke it when he fell off my desk, he would still use it) . I will start with one and the most important thing, the sound that this microphone collects is terribly noisy and has a terrible sound quality! I don't know where the positive opinions about the fact that the sound quality is very good and so on come from. It's all bullshit and false. Secondly the clip, which offers the microphone almost nothing, the microphone is very hard to place anywhere, so it keeps falling down. The microphone is also very good at collecting voice, but because of the poor sound quality it is almost no advantage."
3798,"Unfortunately, I cannot join in the flattering opinions. Your doctor's treatment in infants basically brings about a sewer injection. There was no interview, no research, no word about the treatment. After entering the office, I was given a card to sign the consent and the child was taken to the surgery, explaining that this is best for the child. The baby was asleep, woke up on the table and was hungry and instead of eating this terrible procedure and still it was snoring for 7 days. Generally the baby experienced trauma (me too) afterwards it stopped eating and got very nervous and the consequences could be really serious. The procedure itself was done efficiently, but it didn't help because it wasn't there that was a problem that the doctor couldn't know about because there was no test."
3799,"I am suffering from LSD and unfortunately I have had the dubious pleasure of testing many of the anti-dandruff shampoos available on the market, including those with a prescription. Dandrene tried 'em and unfortunately they did not work on me. The manufacturer writes on his website that this is the most effective anti-dandruff shampoo on the market. I do not agree with this statement and have therefore decided to write em an opinion here . Nobody smiles to pay 100 PLN for a shampoo that does not work as described . From my own experience I know that much better work much cheaper shampoos with selenium sulfide, from myself I recommend Capitis duo . Thank you and I do not recommend it to others: )"
3800,"If we could put up 10 . A doctor by vocation . The doctor loves children and loves doing what he does . Despite the fact that many of her patients have never seen her in a bad mood. She knows every patient by name and even without even looking at the card, she associates disease stories . Amazing! ! Our daughter had trouble breathing, we're still suffocating from coughing. Despite the fact that we were at the clinic a few times no one even came up with what the doctor senses after a minute of conversation. Despite vaccinations, our daughter has undergone a CTBE and E C. Further diagnostics also confirmed 100 % of your doctor's assumptions. Wonderful doctor! There are no such doctors anymore, so please live a healthy life for 100 years. Thank you"
3801,"We were visiting our family and for the second time we stayed in Ibis styles in Walbrzych. The hotel is adjacent to the mall ""Victoria"" and Cinema City, so the entertainment and the loss of cash was taken care of. We have two children, so we took a 2 + 2 studio. For this price the rooms are very good, cleaned daily, towels changed etc. Breakfast is included in the price, Swedish tables, tasty, although after 3 nights of staying, it is already quite monotonous. For children there is a lot of choice. The only downside was that the buns were not fresh throughout the stay, only the dark sunflower bread was fresh, probably baked by the hotel. I fully appreciate the hotel very well."
3802,"The hotel was probably in its heyday in the 90s. The rooms do not encourage you to spend time in them, the TV sets should be in the museum of technology, and the room was not cleaned and the sachets with shampoo were not replenished. Plus good breakfasts (bad coffee), a decent restaurant and internet."
3803,"The book contains a lot of valuable information. It turns out that oranges eaten in winter are not so healthy because they are not intended for the climate zone where Poland is located. Nature invented this way that what grows in Poland is also suitable for people who live here. I have eaten bananas and oranges so far in winter in the belief that they are very healthy. From the book she found out that it is exactly the opposite. I haven't eaten any citrus for two months now, but instead a warm, full-bodied breakfast and she stopped carrying handkerchiefs, which she hadn't practically parted with before. I highly recommend it."
3804,"... of independent hotels, if only such facilities could fully exploit its potential. Only 38% of British independent hotels offer their guests additional products such as a bouquet of flowers or a bottle of champagne when booking online. The facilities that do not have such an offer or a similar one are irretrievably missing an opportunity to increase their revenues, according to a survey conducted by Micros. The company also notes that 39% of the objects that do not have such or similar offerings are losing the opportunity to increase their revenues, according to a survey conducted by Micros. hotels do not appear on the first page of Google search results for the keywords that best describe these hotels."
3805,"I think that as for the three stars that the hotel has, you can definitely recommend it. A room of frenzy didn't make such a standard of three stars with a bathroom and a balcony. At the pool I would say very calmly, free sun loungers can be found quietly. Two restaurants, four bars. The food is very good. Every day something different and a wide range of dishes. Everyone found something good for themselves. Location ok . 7 minutes to the beach . Quiet neighborhood, no parties around the hotel. Very nice service to help. Also to sum up, I can definitely recommend this hotel as well as the whole Benidorm. The thermal sea, there is always some place on the beach and the proximity of the mountains. There is something good for everyone."
3806,"The hotel is located in a very good location - literally a few steps away from the metro station, in a beautiful building with a very charming green courtyard. Nice staff with a very good command of English. WiFi worked perfectly. Our room was clean, although tiny, and the beds were very comfortable. The downside is the lack of breakfast option and not very visible hotel designation - it would be useful to improve it. Overall, the hotel is a really good option for a few days' stay - good value for money."
3807,"The room was exceptionally small and not as intelligently planned as described on the website - we had only two bags and even one of them could not fit into a hiding place under the bed. Although the breakfasts were very tasty, you could not fully enjoy them because the restaurant is practically in the lobby. In addition, our stay coincided with some promotional campaign of the company with light bulbs, which was set up with stands promoting the company and posters right next to the restaurant. The effect - loud, crowded, I felt as if I was eating at the train station. This year we decided to stay in a hotel across the street. It wasn't particularly charming, but at least it offered normal, suitable rooms for people and a quiet, elegant restaurant. The price for accommodation in both hotels is almost identical. Is there any reason to choose Sound Garden in this case? In my opinion, no."
3808,"The first impression is not the best, it stopped the hotel part a long time ago. The room is tiny - tidy, but it's quite big but . . . Toilet made of a brush compartment I think a person of my height may feel claustrophobic sensations, very poor ventilation. We will see maybe breakfast will surprise me nicely."
3809,"I once landed at your doctor's with cysts on my ovaries, 9 years ago, she cured me with steroids after a month disappeared and went without surgery, I still have no relapses! At the same time she detected a hypothyroidism and now Hashimoto has come. always since these 9 years she gave me a referral for tests, analyses, yes the drugs she likes to prescribe her favorite, but you have to press her and then she says what for, why, kaie etc . In general, if you talk to her, she will refer you and to other research, the old man just sketch his problem well and be inquisitive, and not take something ad hoc because prescribed, now also gets steroids and hormones, I am waiting for the effects, but she told me to her when e.g. the effect was not about it and it was ok, no offense after all she is not God and how to know everything at once, also has to experiment a bit before it hits the core. Recently she has lost a lot of hair, having the feeling that it is from hormones. . At first she didn't let herself be convinced that it could be like this, and on the second visit she took care of herself and ordered the tests and I saw that she was wondering that it could be like this, even though she says that nobody has ever complained about such symptoms from thyroid hormones. . . ...maybe either one of you has it too? The doctor is worthy of recommendation! Just ask her, and don't expect her to say anything: )"
3810,"I was sent to your professor after 6 operations in Polanica Zdrój. 21 . 05 she had an operation - nose and lip correction, straightening of the septum. the only thing the professor told me is that Polanica has failed. She had a hole in her palate! She could have strangled me. . Sophie fixed my problem, now I speak much cleaner, I have a nicer and smaller nose, I breathe normally. . . .a great surgeon and I want to talk to her. Every operation is approached individually! I recommend! I'm probably going to have one more surgery but I'm sure this time it's the last one!"
3811,"He wants to share our impressions from the first days in Shengjin with everyone. So yes - I had no exorbitant expectations about this place, especially since I have read many forums and pages with opinions, but I honestly state that with every negative opinion I agree 100%. All inclusive is not even a drama, but rather a bottom line. Alcohol is issued in a room by the pool. The lady stands behind a shelf of the type from which it seems galvanized ice cream and funnels into plastic cups of vodka, crampons or brandy. In order to create a drink I have to pour dramatic quality juice from the distributor myself. There is no ice for drinks, no coke. There's nothing. The restaurant is a second failure. There is one, the only, tiny one, and we, as we are with the executive, have had us eat somewhere else, but unfortunately. No choice of dishes, although bad ones are not. The queue for food is slightly 40 minutes standing. The restaurant on the hotel premises is a mass, but only one for the all inclusive option. And now the worst is the beach, it's just a massacre. All so dirty that a man is disgusted to sit down. Old umbrellas, loungers barely alive and ubiquitous dirt. At the very entrance to the sea, we were joyfully greeted by a drifting headliner and other rubbish - paper, polystyrene. Drama. Every now and then somebody walks around with a commercial offer, you can't order in peace. A 6-year-old boy was selling beer and asked us to buy it from him. The worst thing is that we have to survive here 13 more days and we really deeply inundate our choice. I doubt that in the next few days something will improve, but the first impression is a total massacre. As far as the advantages are concerned, there are two - the executive room is very nice and spacious and the pool. This is where the pluses end: ) The holiday cost us a hell of a lot of money, because we're supposed to be here for 15 days and yet she paid me for the executive room, which had to obligate even to eat in another section, but apart from the fact that it looks better than standard, there are no privileges. I wouldn't recommend it for free, she wouldn't come back here: )"
3812,"I agree with the person who claims that the doctor is not listening to the patient. He's got some theories of his own, and he's treating it anyway. In my family, we've also experienced this doctor. Because the person was suffering from a deadly disease of good actions on the part of the doctor was unfortunately very little. The condition was getting worse. When we were in another hospital, the doctor stated that he would apply a completely different treatment scheme. Unfortunately, it was too late. Today that person is already dead. Therefore I strongly advise against this doctor. I think he is a very weak doctor."
3813,"Introduction to programming - labs and lectures The course is from the archaic environment of Turbo Pascal , I recommend Mr. Tyca to all those who have had a bit of trouble with Pascal , Way to pass for self-study : In the first class, approach the instructor and ask him how to get the credit without going to the labs, he tells you to write a program based on databases, you write the program you give away and if you put yourself in it you get 5 or 5, 5 with the transcript of this grade for the lecture, you do not have to write a test for the credit of the lectures."
3814,"Dr . Nazar takes private for 120 PLN for which it is not known, and in general he does not work and does not operate in any hospital anymore. He also deceived me, my son this year in December it will be 4 years since the knee endoprosthesis was taken out and the doctor did not advise to include him on the waiting list for a prosthesis. He also did not answer the phone and wrote a text message, of course his secretary [ probably only in name because this lady works in the hospital im. When she wanted to answer the phone, the day before yesterday she cheated me, she said that Nazar would be there and he wasn't there [ because he doesn't work there anymore ]. She got mad at me and went to the director of the hospital and then the sack came out, but I hope that everything will be fine and my son's leg will be fine. I'm warning everyone who treats him, he's just a liar ."

3816,"Before coming to the hotel, my husband and I called to book a room. When we arrived, we paid for our stay in advance and then we went to the designated room. As it turned out, an announcement was hanging on the elevator door that on day 28 . 09 . 2015r . From 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. there will be no hot water. Why did not anyone inform us by phone as well as at the reception! ! ! ! If I hadn't read this message, I would have probably been surprised in the morning. Dramatic service, no information. When we returned to the reception desk, we demanded a refund. I do not recommend - drama ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
3817,"I am ashamed of this hotel My friend from India decided to visit Poland, and because I come from the vicinity of Sandomierz this and this town was enchanted by it, but the hotel left terrible memories on it myself I was a witness to rent the most expensive rooms in which there were screwed up radiators in the rooms was very cold not to mention the restaurant, the staff didn't speak good English and had to translate everything on the door, they hung out a piece of paper asking us to clean the rooms after we came back and found us not cleaned the rooms but dirty hotel underwear was taken out of the bathroom and left in the room demeaning behaviour! ! The hotel lost a lot of money to a very wealthy woman, and the staff completely failed to speak! ! ! I won't recommend this hotel to anyone anymore! ! !"

The food is very good except for a monotonous breakfast in a typical English style. Animation good ( hello Alex ) . Rental car rental offered by the hotel with quite attractive prices. To the center on foot at least 25 - 30 minutes, with children about 45."
3821,"Hotel super - delicious food, waiters and entertainers and people working in this resort are nice and helpful. The swimming pools are clean, large. Getting to the beach is only 3 steps. Everything is constantly cleaned, a beautiful place. It was my first time in Turkey, but I feel like I'll be at this hotel again next year. The only thing I recommend you to do is when booking a deluxe room, because the standards in Turkey are a bit different: ) PS It's worth giving tips to such nice people who all the time smiling working from 7. 00 to 23 . 00"
3822,"She was pregnant with this doctor, but I advise against all future mums. All the examinations that she had done during the pregnancy were asked for, the doctor does not say anything of his own (you have to ask about everything, which causes him visible irritation), he did not consider it appropriate to order me the examinations that are required for admission to the hospital for delivery. He does not comment at all on the ultrasound examination (he only gives a printout). I was not able to watch my baby on an ultrasound, and when she asked me about the sex of the baby, she heard that it should not have any meaning for me (she had to go to another doctor to find out the sex). Throughout the pregnancy, the doctor didn't give me a gynaecological or breast examination once."
3823,"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS, PZA) belongs to the group of physical and mental congenital diseases. Its symptoms are e.g.: malformations (e.g. heart and joints), damage to the central nervous system, neurological disorders, delayed physical and mental development, behavioural disorders, mental underdevelopment, psychomotor hyperactivity. These abnormalities may result in learning difficulties, concentration of attention, memory and ability to solve problems, lack of motor coordination and speech disorders. FAS impairments have an impact on intellectual and social development also during adolescence and after adulthood. Often people from FAS are not able to take responsibility for their own lives, often break the law and for years are condemned to help various organizations and institutions."
3824,"I spent one night at the Chopin Hotel. The biggest advantage is certainly the location, proximity to the center and the communication hub. The rooms are very small, cold, the heating is not working, I turned on the thermostat, I turned off the valve on the radiator - nothing. . . On the hotel's website in the description of the Classic room it is written ""Coffee and tea making facilities"" - there was no kettle but a small bottle of mineral water and plastic cups. . . . At the porter's office I found out that the kettle has only ""Superior"" rooms. . . .the website says otherwise. Nice service."

With Professor Wlasak you can get along, just go to him to explain what happened on the wheel, he will ask you a few questions, you will answer and you will pass, just show him that you know what it is and you understand the questions. The lectures are generally not understandable (especially those of quantum), at first glance he seems a brave guy, but this is not the case at all, go to him for a consultation, he will gladly explain. : ) : )"
3826,"The curriculum of oncology varies depending on where the student is studying and with whom he is teaching. The university is not geared to providing expertise ready to be transferred to everyday clinical practice. The basic skill expected from a medical university graduate is to diagnose cancer. A young doctor must know what symptoms may suggest cancer in the patient and skilfully conduct a diagnosis. However, specialist treatment is reserved for oncologists, oncological surgeons, radiotherapists, oncological gynaecologists etc. The treatment is different for each tumour. The conference ""Innovations in Oncology"" is to provide specialist knowledge about colorectal, ovarian and thyroid cancer. Doctors will learn how to treat patients surgically, what are the advances in chemotherapy and what to expect from pathomorphologists who produce a histopathological report. Such a report will confirm the diagnosis of cancer. Some of the pathomorphology centres are limited to compulsory information, while specialist centres also provide additional information, which is extremely valuable for the patient's further management."
3827,Despite the low price. . . we can at least expect the hotel to be neat and clean - not even so here! Dirty dirt dirt. . . . . In the room massacred dirty floor Dirty radiator - flooded bathroom Bathroom damaged dirty entrance in the hallway dirty with creaking floor . . . Breakfast very weak ! Hotel staff quiet and buried . If someone with a similar price has another choice please choose another option . The only advantage is the location. . . . .but it's a little bit small these days.

Yes Basis of assessment in the index / credit: 2 colloquia, as missing 0 , 5 p . do not count on the grace of surprise: no sense of humor General approach to the student: positive General assessment: 4 (1 - 5) You can learn a lot, all clearly presented, you can see that the teacher lives what he does, colloquia is quite difficult, you have to learn a lot, the results are given at an express rate after about . 2 days,"
3829,I was convinced by a seemingly solid cassette. It wasn't so funny in the details. Uniifon is painted and not tinted in the mass which means that after a few weeks silver paint started to come off and it looks dramatic. The cassette works as a taco on rainy days. After a long rain one squeal and he started to call himself . Average feeling as in the middle of the night woke up my little children. I wouldn't recommend it and I'm angry with Castorama who trades this crap. They've given up the money but only for the equipment and the installation on our side.
3830,"I've had the stove for almost 3 years and it's the second time a hydrogenerator has died. The first time after 3 months of use - replacement on warranty. At this point it is already after the warranty and the cost of replacement b . large : ( . In addition, before you decide to buy Vaillant heaters you should check if you have very good water pressure. I live on the 10th floor, in a block of large slab where the pipes are already old. After installing the stove it turned out that the hot water pressure is much lower than the cold water pressure. Unfortunately, I wasn't given this information in the shop - only the fitter explained to us that the Vaillants reduce the hot water pressure much more than for example. Junkers."
3831,"You've been acting badly at the reception desk. I get to the place, enter the room and go out for a meeting. I come back late at night and the room is closed. I come down to ask what's going on. I find out that they can't get the money out of the account. He told me that the company will take care of it the next day in the morning, but he with a smile on his face did not let me go to the room where my things were! ! ! Additionally, he did not want to give me his name, which is a pity, because we have to give it regularly. I advise against Mr. Dariusz, a brazen person. I will not come back here anymore and I am in Cracow on a regular basis."
3832,"Quiet hotel with a beautiful view and tasty cuisine. Nice staff, clean, comfortable rooms and the best place to swim on the island. After two stays I can't wait for the next one, this is our favorite hotel in Rhodes. Try the painted sour in the pool bar, the evening after dinner, preferably done by a bartender named Wasilikos, I guess I'm sorry if she made a mistake. The downside is that she would have replaced the beach chairs."
3833,"She didn't think she'd write it, but a nightmare hotel! I usually choose a hotel so that m is satisfied and so that m can write a good word about it. Holy shit now I can't! Failure! The amount of the room was exorbitant, but somehow it was zero! A squalid building! A hotel made like a hospital or a barracks. High rooms, bathroom like a hall somewhere in the corner of the toilet after a long walk you could come across a sink and around the corner you could see a shower. Rooms heated up like in a hospital literally. She must have slept with windows open in November. Dry air through it . The bed is not comfortable. Squeaky! Breakfast on the lowest line. The only thing I can write positive is the people who work there are very nice and helpful. That's the only plus! I'm not going back there anyway!"
3834,"Additional points could be obtained, for example, for accessibility for disabled people or a baby changing table. Our guests appreciate the homely atmosphere created both in the hotel and in the restaurant. This is probably also thanks to our chefs from the region, who use recipes that have been proven for years. Without duplicating the boring, international stampa so common in hotel catering, we have managed to combine tradition with a bit of fantasy. I am convinced that it is thanks to this that we joined the Culinary Trail of Silesian Flavours. ""The Silesian Province is famous for its good cuisine. Few realize, however, how varied it is. Czech, Austrian, German, and finally Jewish influences have left their mark and made Silesia one of the most interesting culinary regions in Poland."
3836,"Despite his young age, a very good doctor. A contact, patient-oriented doctor. He explained to me exactly what happened and how to treat it. The previous orthopaedist, where em was, sent me to a non cheap surgery. Dr. Pyda suggested an injection and conservative treatment (rehabilitation) to start with. It's been over six months and my knee is doing fine."
3837,"Just like my mother was at his place with her child in a private clinic and he was just as unpleasant and rude to me. Comments he allowed himself, below criticism. She left me with a big disgust (my son too!) . He may be a great specialist, but nothing justifies such behavior towards parents. I strongly advise against it !"
3838,She had the dubious pleasure of being on several visits to this gentleman's private office and it was 8 years ago. After reading the opinion she decided to add her own because I see that the doctor has not changed anything. During the examination in the chair he behaved inappropriately towards me ( he was getting on ) . Disgusting! And also his dirty jokes. My husband and I started coming to visit. He took a lot of money out of us and didn't help us. I advise against
3839,"Dr. Rujny went to em after the cures that I have been undergoing so far in other establishments where I have a subscription from the company (so theoretically I do not pay for these visits). The treatment was always the same and always on the same tablets . But always the recurrence of the disease appeared after some time. So I thought I would invest a lot of money (180 PLN visit) and maybe Dr. Rujna will come up with some new therapy more effective. Unfortunately it turned out that nothing else can be done and the treatment is again based on the same medicines and so on. So theoretically I spent 180 zloty on what I heard em all the time. Nevertheless, I give a good grade because it is certainly a professional. The only thing stopping me from getting a very good grade is that when you pay such money it is 5-10 minutes in the office it is a little short."
3840,"He's often not in class. During the lecture he often talks about balls, and happens to be jammed on some subject. For those who do not belong to his training groups he can make problems with passing the lecture: ?"
3841,"The hotel has a fifth star - only for the weight in the bathroom and access to the city aquapark. Three stars top! Swimming pools, whirlpools, etc. are available to the public. Everywhere crowds, noise and lack of places to rest in peace. If someone likes crowds of screaming children and their parents calling out loudly - it's here! Even in the saunas there is no silence and no conditions to relax. I advise against it. I was here for the first and last time. It is better to sit at a busy crossroads on a chair and for less money sit for a few hours"
3842,"When choosing a hotel for a two-week stay during the holidays, I was guided by the opinions of guests. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. Prices are exorbitant and not adequate to the hotel offer. Very high prices in the spa. The pool is very small. As far as children are concerned, there are no attractions. You have to make an appointment for bowling in advance. Eating the same food every day: meat or fish, one soup to choose from. For the children you could possibly order fries or pancakes: heated and hard. Dessert also the same every day: pudding, kisiel. Breakfast also leaves much to be desired. For children there is a playroom available, only in the name of it resembles. The only plus is that it's close to the beaches. For children especially with strollers I do not recommend because there is a steep entrance. In general, the hotel is completely unsuitable for families with children. The room was to be with a double bed and was with two beds joined together by a sheet. Generally I do not recommend ! ! ! !"
3843,"The first impression, a nice man, kept his word for what a plus, but unfortunately we have not achieved anything concrete together in my case and to this day I am tired of chronic duodenitis and reflux. . . . .and the drugs from the same group have not given the expected improvement for 9 years. . . . . .I was hoping to find a solution together to at least slightly improve my comfort of life, unfortunately I did not receive sufficient help from the Doctor and he even directed me to the wrong track, which has been a year since the previous visit and I am still stuck at the starting point."
3844,"Hotel in another hotel. Designed for the less demanding. Clean rooms, with towels and hand soap. Separate toilet . A small shower pasted into the wall next to the toilet and washed. Television and internet works . For the less and medium demanding, for several nights rather than a longer stay. And a piece from the center, if someone is not motorized then they stay in a taxi or public transport. Well, I forgot about breakfast. It's not a five-star hotel, so there's nothing to be picky about. Breakfast is buffet style, but you can have one."
3845,"The principle of the probe is to introduce a thin needle into the tumor area or lymph node, which will give you almost instant information on whether HER2 is positive or negative and accurately quantify its concentration. ""Today, the diagnosis of a tumor is very time consuming. It is also a complicated and painful test for patients. The use of the microscope will save the woman from the pain and stress associated with the biopsy and long waiting for the results"" - explains Marcin Staniszewski, the originator and CEO of SDS Optic. The current version of the device is capable of detecting marker concentrations in medically required ranges. Thanks to the probe, there will no longer be any need for tissue collection, and the precise numerical result of the examination will be delivered to the doctor and the patient in several minutes."
3846,"We were shocked and appalled how a hotel with three stars can represent such a low level. The room card has failed several times, the malice of things dead Ok . In the bathroom the paint was going away from the ceiling - OK poor ventilation, and the mushroom on the paddling pool and the clogged drain, it's a bit of a foretaste. About the desire to eat dinner receptions need to be notified two hours early - Ok, but I do not know why the waiting time for the soup in the form of tomato puree is at least 40 minutes. The most patient guests leave the dining room without dessert going to the city center for kebab. The staff - a waiter who is alone for the entire dining room and hotel bar I understand perfectly well that he does not want to smile and is with a light smile. . and well, let's demand professionalism, you pay for something. . . You can complain at the reception - hmm. . . . The receptionist accepts complaints with a smile on her face on her own chest promising improvement and bravely apologizing. . . A written complaint, of course, has nowhere to complain. . . . .I wonder why? ? ? ? ! ! ! Important facts and information - you can use the swimming pool, but during the designated hours the hotel will store the hotel 18 - 23 : 00, but the receptionist will inform you about this fact when a man stands in front of her in a bathing suit wrapped in a towel. Eh . . . dinner for some people is not given to eat because it is hard to get to the rooms, so man rushes about 9 : 05 for breakfast (issued from 6 - 11), and there stand empty bains after scrambled eggs and sausages dripping with tasty fat. . ech watermelon can be crunched because you have to ask for bread. Well, though, that there was no shortage of coffee, although I do not know what awaits those arriving about 10 : 10 . I wish all visitors with all my heart, good luck and strong nerves! Justyna Wroclaw"
3847,"I'm very disappointed with this doctor. I'm almost 40 years old and my husband and I have decided to have our first child. I know that after 35 years of age, such pregnancies are potentially threatened. Full of questions and anxiety I went privately, because you know - at the National Health Fund it happens differently, and if you pay 130 PLN it is expected that the doctor will pay you more attention. The visit was express. When I asked if I should take any vitamins, do some tests, prepare myself somehow for getting pregnant, the only answer she heard was that ""I shouldn't panic"" and I should ""hug my husband hard"". From my sisters' experience I know that they had tests done on hormones, took vitamins, folic acid and followed a healthy diet. Because that's what gynaecologists told them. When she asked me directly about it, he said that it was completely unnecessary but if I insisted, I could do the tests. The ultrasound examination was only done because she asked me to do it. I think it is a very unprofessional approach to the patient. Lost money and lost time. I don't recommend it to anyone, and certainly not to women who have decided to have a child at a later age."
3848,"The berry may not measure all women with one measure. What does the profession have to do with being handsome? Maybe there are women who go to the doctor's because, if you apologize, ""they have no one to show to"". but don't exaggerate, don't say that women are already like that, that they go to a doctor they like! I understand that the doctor has not lived up to your expectations and you are entitled to a negative opinion, but the comments that he is popular or sought after because of his charm are a big exaggeration for me. By the way, how beautiful you are not at all, that is my opinion."
3849,"Admittedly, my visit took place 2 or 5 years ago, but it doesn't really matter. The visit to your class - Mazurkiewicz was my first visit to a gynaecologist. You only examined me "" manually "" . Despite my suggestions she did not commission any tests, not even cytology (she was 22 or 5 years old then)! ! ! She said that I have to do the cytology in a year. But she blindly prescribed me medication (probably gynalgin, but I don't remember) just in case! ! ! After some time (after a visit to another doctor) Ms. Klasa - Mazurkiewicz experienced a nightmare - tears and fear when it turned out that I have to go to the hospital to take cervical thyroid clippings for a histopathological diagnosis. Every successive doctor was surprised that I had not been referred to cytology before and that such a condition as I have had to develop for a longer time. Fortunately it turned out that I do not have cancer cells but I have to treat myself and it will be complicated, long treatment. Mrs. Mazurkiewicz is a threat to women!"
3850,"Does anyone know if Dr. Nizinkiewicz treats children after West's cerebral palsy and epilepsy? It is an urgent matter, because in Lidzbark nobody knows about it, and the son has a lot of seizures and medicines prescribed in the Children's Health Centre do not work. Please answer me. Marianna Kozioł"
3851,"TRAGEDY AND DRAMA ! ! ! ! I do not judge the Professor's medical abilities, but I have never encountered such a brazen and arrogant approach to the patient before! ! ! I went to consult with L5 / S1 discopathy. After 3 minutes Professor said that you need to operate. When asked what method of surgery Mr. Professor suggested, he said that it did not matter and I should not bother him because he has a lot of patients and say whether he decides to operate or not. He replied that he would be happy to go to the surgery but he wanted me to know some details and the method of operation. The professor replied that he wouldn't explain anything to me but that I should decide and not take time. I do not recommend this professor to anyone with such a hopeless approach to the patient. He paid em 300 zloty for the visit, which lasted 7-8 minutes and he only found out from it that the operation was advisable. What kind of surgery? Where ? When ? NOTHING MORE. DRAMAT."
3852,"Location : definitely by car : ) although it is close to everywhere anyway. The only downside is the construction site outside the window, but it's not the hotel's fault. Rooms: all clean, renovated, fragrant. Kitchenette in the room which can be used despite the restaurant serving meals. Food: we only had breakfast included in the price in the form of a Swedish buffet of course. Large choice, nice service, tasty: ) The price is as good as possible. I recommend ! : )"
3853,"Very good man ! Admittedly, the lectures are moderately interesting, and the making of the foil leaves a lot to be desired. But the credit for 5 comes down to participation in all or almost all (possibility of 1 absence). You can get some sleep or play Quake ' and on your laptop. I recommend it!"
3854,"I strongly advise against buying this flashlight. I use it for professional purposes, it works in conditions of low or complete lack of light, so the batteries charged em daily. Two weeks after the purchase, the plastic tape broke off, which protects the cover of the battery tray from being lost, the same day the hook broke off, through which goes a rubber strap holding the torch on its head. Other disadvantages: the color of the light falls into a delicate shade of green, the flashlight switch is placed too deep, which almost makes it impossible to turn on the flashlight on so called ""feel"", the flashlight must be removed from the head and tinker with the switch, underdeveloped hinge and click the change of the angle of the flashlight, all the time since the purchase I had the impression that in a moment something will break, in the two lowest brightness modes you can see the annoying strobe effect, especially bothersome when using tools with fast-rotating elements such as . The material from which the torch is made almost certainly comes from recycled material, which at its price should not happen. To sum up, I spent 150 PLN and after two weeks I can throw the torch away."
3855,"She tried to treat my son with Dr. Szczesiul about 9 m - t, in general, maybe it didn't hurt, but it didn't help either. The fact that once he managed to hit and in three days he pulled the baby out of the cough, but generally the other treatments lasted very long, not to mention the cost and frequent visits. The child as he had reflux so he had, plus allergies despite following strictly the recommendations. . As a result of the fact that nothing these treatments did not bring, we went back to the traditional treatment, and only now, it has been about two years, we can say that we are going to go straight. So I wouldn't recommend, a waste of time when it comes to chronic diseases like allergy and reflux."
3856,"For me it is one of the best hotels in Poland. It deserves five stars. It's been here for the third time and I'll definitely come back again. A double room spacious and bright . Room service decent and discreet without attention, beautiful large complex of saunas and swimming pools. Silence zone - brine pool impressive especially in the evening with lighting and a lit fireplace . Complete relaxation is what to do on a rainy day. Nice large salt cave with a thermae . Night club also very nice . My husband just didn't like the music a bit but that's a detail . You can have a reservation only to the bowling lanes . Some tracks jam without releasing the balls which stops the game and it is a little tedious to approach the bartender every now and then to get the balls out . Also, when throwing the balls you have to have wet wipes to wipe your fingers because the holes are terribly dirty. There is delicious food in the hotel not to mention dessert bowls for cooks . The hotel is highly recommended."
3857,"The first birth is a great unknown to each of us. . . ...the fear of pain, of what will happen. When the whole machine starts and the most beautiful moment of life begins, the woman does not want anything as much as a professional support. And that's what Mrs. Paulina is like. . . . . .professionalism in her profession. She felt safe from the very beginning, from the first phone call, that something ''is beginning to happen.

3859,"Doctor, 20 years ago you put me on my feet, you made me and my family enjoy life, you supported my parents in these difficult moments, word I thank you not enough to express the gratitude that both I and my family feel for you. I am 26 years old now and I thank God every day for putting you on my turn of life at that time, Doctor, if you did not know how my story would end, but I suspect it would not be a happy ending. Once again, I give my heartfelt thanks!"
3860,"""A strong magnetic field produced during the operation of the resonance is directed along the tunnel where the patient is located and forces this small magnet to position itself in the direction of the scanner field acting on it"" - explains Dr. Eng. Tomasz Wolak from the World Hearing Center. The force acting on him is so great that he pops out of the ""pocket"". The implant is located and can move under the skin beyond the implant, causing damage to the implant. According to Dr. Wolak, the MRI examination would have to be performed in a weak magnetic field (below 0,5 tesla), which reduces the quality of the obtained images. Or the implant would have to be removed before the examination and then implanted again, which in turn exposes the patient to further procedures."
3861,"The room was clean while in the bathroom after taking out the soap dispenser there was dirt, dirt and once again BRUD. Aaaaaaaaa another big minus, namely the cost of 40 PLN per parking space is a thick bend."
3862,"advantages: terrace location and proximity of the beach: mushroom in the bathroom; no working wifi; no kettle in the room; the biggest disadvantage is the ""wall"" separating our room and the neighboring one - the door from the sliding wardrobe and a piece of Styrofoam under it! ! ! ! ! You could hear every word of the people living there and even the sound of using the toilet - which provided zero comfort because listening to someone peeing should rather not take place; monotonous breakfasts - the same every day for 2 people and a child: 3 slices of cheap cold meat, 3 slices of cheese, 1 mini honey, 2 - 3 mini jams, butter, 3 wheat rolls, 3 croissants. coffee and a glass of juice."
3863,"Studies have already been carried out on mice and macaques (primates). The animals were irradiated with a high dose, which is lethal only for some animals. ""In their blood, we examined several hundred different microRNA particles. Using statistical methods, we narrowed down our search and detected three molecules, which indicate a high dose of radiation and two molecules which determine the probability of survival,"" says Dr. Fendler. He explains that macaques are so similar to humans that the findings can be applied to humans. ""In order to check this, we compared the genomes of both species and confirmed that the microRNAs will behave analogously in macaques and humans"" - says a researcher from the City of Łódź."
3865,"Dr. Swierczewski led my two pregnancies - she walked in private because a friend recommended him to me. And I will tell you honestly that I have mixed feelings. On the one hand - always available, on the phone, answers questions. On the other hand, I have an irresistible impression that it is mainly about money. My pregnancies ended in a smart way, although a little panic was on the way. It is difficult for me to assess the competence of the doctor, because some particularly complicated case was not m . But later it turned out that he underestimated some of my ailments, which two other doctors were interested in. Luckily, the case did not turn out to be serious, but Dr Świerczewski did not even take care of it and did not refer me to further examinations. I am sorry to say that he is not particularly caring and inquisitive, which in the case of the doctor is a flaw. It is also true that he does not keep records of patients and often treats even those patients who he has known for years and who have earned a lot of money from. If that's the case, ""in private."" ...then I'm willing to believe that the hospital is worse. If I was in my third pregnancy, I would have chosen another doctor."
3866,"Medium room decoration and standard . Unpleasant, splashing service . Breakfast terrible - only virulent scrambled eggs , hard and white cheese old and dry eggs , tomatoes "" recovered "" or the cheapest baby chocolate crisps. Hotel policy: pay and don't come back! We will definitely not come back!"
3867,"Dr. Oles may be a good specialist, I don't doubt it, but he didn't help us. We drove hundreds of kilometers to get an opinion because we didn't know what to do anymore, and here no more details. The doctor took us in for a moment, a short conversation, he didn't even get acquainted with the results that he had given earlier. As a human being, she perceived me as quite specific, dry, very concrete and a bit arrogant. She left me resigned. She expected me to hear more valuable tips, because she heard a lot of good things about him, very disappointed me."
3868,"I went to your doctor's office once and that was the first and last time. First of all she is very not delicate, she examined me so that she felt me have this examination for another week. Secondly, she wanted me to prescribe me contraceptive pills and she wanted me to come in period to see if I'm not pregnant, she'll prescribe me. At all costs, she wanted to arrange for me to cut out the overdose in her private office. And I was most excited by what she said that we will do the procedure and then we will insert the spirals and she quotes ""you will have peace of mind for 5 years"". And how does she know if I want to have peace of mind for 5 years or maybe she's planning a baby next year. In general she is very unpleasant and unpleasant."
3869,"Photos of the hotel on various websites have given us a very confusing picture of this hotel. Everything nice and elegant, unfortunately, on the spot it turned out that the reality is completely different. The room is damp, which has contributed to the formation of fungus on the wall. Unpleasant smell in the toilet (also moisture, I'm not talking about the lack of cleaning.) Breakfast, depending on when there were a lot of guests in the hotel breakfast was really okay, then unfortunately we were treated with a slightly dried cheese (of course, everything nicely arranged on the plate so there was this was not visible at first sight). Generally speaking, I have mixed feelings. The staff, for even the buffet, the reception desk and the ladies cleaning without fail very nice, tried to help, but throughout the whole trip I did not leave the impression that it is not quite as it should be. Stains on the chairs, stains on the bedding, until the fear was to dig deeper. If the hotel owner quickly does something about it, the courteous staff will not help either. Nevertheless, I wish you good luck."
3870,"We have mixed feelings after the visit we paid a lot for the visit we got a prescription for the ointment which cannot be used for a 1 or 5 year old child who is the subject of the visit. We did not apply the ointment after reading the leaflet about age limits and possible side effects. On the other hand, some of the Doctor's advice was correct and helped to alleviate our daughter's skin problems. This does not change the fact that we will have another visit to another doctor who will adjust the treatment to the age of the child."
3871,"Disadvantages: weak draught, high power consumption, very loud work, after each cleaning requires complete cleaning because the stench that comes out of it for the next day is unbearable, the filters in the water container are so installed that they fall into it during the cleaning, the cleaning of the device is very labor- and time-consuming, short cable, water from the container gets into the filter in the base, during a sudden twist the vacuum cleaner overturns, resulting in the overflow of water into its internal parts. Its work is so loud that it is unbearable. Advantages: no 3 words to summarize: Definitely not recommended."
3872,"The location is excellent, in the very centre of the city, just a stone's throw from restaurants and monuments. Pay parking is located by the river, a few hundred meters from the hotel. It reviews the stay from 3 years ago so there is a chance that the hotel standard has improved. I lived on the top floor with a view through a dormant window. The wallpaper was peeled off, the rooms were cleaned on the heads, the washbasins in the middle of the rooms, the bathrooms were covered with PVC carpet instead of tiles. Generally, poor feeling"
3873,"The hotel is located between the airport and the centre. From the hotel free transport to the airport and the centre several times a day - a very convenient solution. Inbere to the center 2 - 3 Euro ! Rooms very comfortable and clean . The rooms are minimalistically equipped, but everything is TV, hairdryer, work space, air conditioning. Breakfast is modest but tasty, there are hot dishes. Very courteous and young staff. The hotel is very modern and clean. Located on the road to the airport from the other side of the park (forest). I recommend it. ! !"
3874,"I was sent to Dr. Salata by accident, by order of a friend. After 3 years of infertility treatment and looking for various causes of my problems at home, we started to seek a child with my husband. Another fourth year has passed, this time not only of treatment but also of intensive efforts. Unfortunately, without any results. Doctors from my region let go, claiming that the situation is too complicated, the ovarian reserve is exhausted, and time unfortunately did not work in my favor. Then they decided to visit the doctor with my husband. After not a whole year of treatment, including different types of tests, treatments with different medicines, also treatments were successful, although there were difficult moments. Doctor Salata did not lose hope, he always approached the problem with a sense of humor, reminding that the mental state of the future mother is as important in the treatment as the mentioned treatments. I am now in the fifth month of pregnancy. I am convinced that it has been possible to get in and sustain it thanks to the great experience of the doctor. I would like to add that I come from the Podkarpackie Province and despite the long journey, fatigue and costs it was worth getting to know and decide to visit Dr. Salata. I sincerely recommend ."
3875,"Generally the location of the hotel is great, a small minus that you have to go steeply uphill from the street, a beautiful beach although rocky little sand is also found. The only downside is the bathrooms, but I know that this winter it is going to be a general overhaul of them and they will be great. good food, monotonous maybe and like this Greek food is not Egyptian and 5 star hotel. great place as I want to explore near the beach vai, spinalonga super trip I recommend. The city centre on foot 30 minutes and along the way nice views and lots of shops. an intimate hotel for those who appreciate peace and quiet. there are no events there, just in town."
3876,"My child is dizzy and suddenly dizzy. The pediatrician enrolled us to the pea, claiming to be the best doctor in the university clinic. We had an appointment at 12. 30 we entered at 13 . 20 . I showed her a piece of paper from the doctor and at that time kinga told her to undress to see if she had a straight line. She had a zipper sweatshirt that jammed and couldn't take it off. After the tests she got 5 points out of 10 (although I never heard the neurologist give out points) because she went wrong on the line and so on. When I asked what the diagnosis was, she told me that I told her she was sick. I've never seen doctors with such nerve. I'll never go to her again. Dog. I'm sorry I don't put capital letters but my shiwt broke down and the commas too. and I don't recommend visiting her is a bitch and she's just tired of her job because it's probably after 60. Greetings."
3877,"The hotel is located 15 minutes walk from the city centre. But this walk is worth planning - especially when walking along the dykes - a beautiful view of the opposite Vistula river bank. The hotel, unfortunately, is not worth the price. Yes, the architecture is very interesting, the style of the old part of the building is integrated into the new enlarged building, but the quality of hotel services is below standard (4 *) Room service (towels, hygienic articles - tragedy! The only washing liquid offered in the room is a cylinder attached to the wall with the liquid to : Bathing, face, hands, hair. I advise against it ! The towels are already very worn out (the white ones probably remember only from stories, hard, rough). Cleaning in the room is not proper - inaccurate, towels are not arranged, the bed is unevenly covered. However, the worst thing about the hotel is the food - both served for breakfast and lunch or dinner. Monotonous, bland."
3878,"W - 12 WEMIF lecture boring and poorly understood can but poorly rewrites the evaluation of the exercises not found : ) in total friendly I did not go to him at lectures, the presence does not check, it is boring a bit, completely as for me he was not able to pass on what he should put out, the knowledge is huge but he does not know how to pass it. I recommend because it is harmless but you must learn completely alone."
3879,"She was at that hotel in early October. After half an hour of waiting for the lady from the reception desk, it turned out that there was no reservation. Later it turned out that instead of the room with shower I ordered, she had a bathtub with the fact that she had only hot water in the tap and there was no cold, besides there was no light in the corridor, in the room the lamps also did not work because they did not have light bulbs, she had only one upper barely soaring yellow light. There was no heating in the room, no moisture and a lot of dust in the bathroom. Also after one night in this fantastic hotel she got so cold that she ended up with laryngitis. I reported 'em all at once to the lady at the reception but she didn't get me another room or any discount. I'll never go back there again and I don't recommend it to you either. But there is one positive thing, have very delicious food in the restaurant and very nice service also in the restaurant."
3880,The hotel is either new or renovated - the room equipment is undamaged and the bathroom looks like new. Great location . The entrance to the underground is across the street. At the weekend you can use the free car park on the street (100m away there is a police station so it can be considered a guarded car park: ) ) . The hotel offers high-speed Internet access and a printer.
3881,"I do not recommend this doctor and I am surprised that after the first visit she did not look me in the eye. But she had taken the material for the examination, so she went to another visit to find out the result, but then it turned out that despite the obvious symptoms of infection, there was no material taken for the culture, but only cytology, so I was tired for the next few days without proper, directional treatment, but with non-specific, very expensive medicines. Afterwards, when (finally!) I lived to see the results of the culture (paying of course for the next visit), the doctor prescribed me the most expensive preparation, probably present on the market. During each visit, he told very unsavoury jokes about the patients he treated earlier. I strongly advise against it!"
3882,"Refers to the lecture on organic chemistry . General evaluation : I recommend ! ! ! In a few words . The professor is a super man, very nice and nice. In the semester there are two colloquia (tasks only and only with exercise letters!), if someone fails to collect 50%, then later there is still a complete colloquium. If you want to fight for a higher grade, there is no problem, you answer verbally without losing the grade you have already earned."
3883,"An interesting place, although there are a few issues for significant improvement. The hotel staff is not very qualified. It's a big drawback. I don't understand how the staff can pass guests in the corridor without saying good morning. I don't understand why at an hour. 6 a.m. guests are woken up by a septic tanker emptying the cesspool for about . . . hour with a pump pulled out? Such work is planned for later hours or warns guests about possible noise. This is not why you come to such a secluded place that such ""attractions"" wake us up. The whole evaluation is very much increased by the catering part. We were both very positively surprised by the variety of dishes on breakfast and lunch buffets. The taste of the dishes is amazing. Lots of own preserves and honey from the nearby apiary. The raspberry jam was insane. The dumplings served had an unusually delicate cake. For meals, freshly squeezed juice from vegetables and fruits . Despite the imperfections described above, it gives such a high note thanks to delicious cuisine. In the picture, a trout tartar."
3884,"The first time was with a dietitian and probably the last. It's just obesity makes my life harder and something I have to do about it. The lady was very nice and probably competent, she gave me a detailed menu, but it's not for me. I work, my wife also, in the house numerous duties, and to prepare these meals from the menu I would probably have to hire a housekeeper, and that would be a full-time job. The list of ingredients itself to buy for the first two days is probably with 50 items, the part not to be bought in an ordinary local shop, and preparing it every day at least 2 - 3 hours. The end result was that they rejected em from their meals sugar, pork, bread, and replaced it with fruit, vegetables, honey, fish. But that's what I can read about in the first better guide, I don't have to go to a dietician. Apparently it is a specialist for housewives who are bored at home and can spend half a day shopping and pitching. And I have too much work to do"
3885,"I was persuaded by the masseur Arthur Wieczorek to visit you, Dr. Wilson. Preeti Agrawal. I see, after these comments, that they are reprimanding each other's clients. He's doing a massage ""opening up energy channels"". After the change of masseur I saw the difference between the healing massage and the massage ""on the fable"" . The comments about the doctor are so extreme that I would definitely check every diagnosis she makes with another doctor ."
3886,"The doctor is leading my first pregnancy. I am very pleased with every visit. Nice and warm doctor with extensive knowledge. You can see he's working with a vocation. A very thorough specialist and friendly man. As a patient, he feels very comfortable with it. I feel that we are in good hands with our son. My full trust of the doctor gained from the first visit when I came almost crying after a visit to another doctor. He listened to me calmly, calmed me down, examined me and explained everything thoroughly in a gentle manner. If I have to contact the doctor I always have so that I feel really safe as his patient. She wouldn't trade me for any other doctor. I highly recommend it."
3887,"Hotels tend to have budgets and many agencies are aware of this and address their offer to them. If they don't, they don't ""play"" with cost-intensive marketing because online distribution channels are sufficient for their needs. However, the situation when the agency after the brief, its own visions and the realization of the underdeliver is common. So we can turn this mem on accordingly - agency promises vs. implementation"
3888,"Room booked from the Group's offer - it was to be a room worth 320zl per night ! ! in the hostel for 60zl would be a higher standard ! ! Holey sheets, smearing insects behind dirty walls, falling down flap; and the biggest surprise is the g. 23 to the room, without knocking, opens the door with another person's card - ""I'm just checking""! ! To make comments you should meet with the manager, who does not come to work on time! ! I DISCOURAGE YOU!"
3889,"You do not know where to start so maybe from the beginning, check-in to Superior room (995zł / night), the appearance of the room as in a mountain guesthouse and not a few star hotel, trampled, slightly green, a few days of snow lying on the balcony. Two separate beds despite the assurance that it will be King Size. Spa area, one working sauna! ! ! Roman baths did not work, the temperature in the brine is like outside, the only one that works is Finnish - and that's why it's clogged with people. Whip / waterfalls do not work. Hand treatment (pilling and mask) for 130zł is a misunderstanding, a face treatment (mask with vitamin C) 480zł? It's now maybe about food, quail broth and sweet and sour soup with chicken - two same soups with different names. Veal roast for over 70zł turned out to be a ground chop. Dear managers, it's time to visit some of the world and see how it should look like! . . ."
3890,"The village itself has no attacks, but in a short distance is Długopole Zdrój with a beautiful park and healing waters. The Silesia Centre is a three-storey building without an elevator, which works in the minus. On the plus side there is boarding - breakfast and dinner Swedish buffet very varied and all homemade. There is a large football and volleyball field and an outdoor swimming pool. A great place for trips with children or colonies."
3891,"Drama. A room so small that there is nowhere to open a suitcase. Breakfast may be varied, but the quality of the products is a massacre. Coffee probably from ground chestnuts . Hair dryer without a windmill protection which resulted in the hair being pulled in. Iron with a wiped cable, shoots, makes short circuits - fear to use. NOTE ! ! ! The hotel is not located 1 km away from the Old Town but with 2,5 . We will never come back here again."
3892,"In addition to the relatively low price and a nice external appearance, it is difficult to find positive aspects of this hotel. It is a 20 minute walk from the last metro stop (Overground) and Crystal Palace Park one way and Selhurst Park Stadium the other. The room priced at 49£/night had a double bed, a tiny bathroom, a TV (""behind the cloud"" picture) and a kettle and tea. The room was led to a labyrinth (literally) - it took about 2 minutes to get to it through narrower and narrower corridors and stairs, once up and once down. The service was not pleasant, not very communicative, most of them speaking fluent English. A parcel in my name (tickets for the match) was delivered to the hotel, however, the staff sold me out, couldn't find it, and then announced that the postman wouldn't be here until 11:00 p.m. At 11:30 p.m. After my next intervention it turned out that the parcel was still in the drawer. The lack of agreement between the staff and the unwillingness to help plus the ever-long queue of hotel guests as unhappy as I am caused additional frustration and ultimately a very negative opinion of the hotel. I don't recommend to anyone, even steel nerves can let go there."
3894,"Some of the straw is coming out of their shoes. A week with a flight for 1100zl? And you have requirements? You can require it from 2,000 per wasp. + 500 and I think the Shrimp's been through a lot. You want it? Drinks brought to the pool? It's to pay and you don't think that everything is for free. By staying here, I didn't notice that somebody gave them a tip, and everyone can complain about it. The hotel is good as far as the hotelOwszem years of its own and time has shown its own, although it is in the rooms as well as the hotel clean. The staff in the restaurant is young and therefore active and very niceWifi also works in the room and on the 4th floor. The fact that it is better to buy something in the city because it is not possible to get drunk or to put up, and it is very unsavoury. Meals - the same, monotonous yes, very small choice but a man with hunger will not die I assure you. Once lunch was over an hour earlier because they really didn't have any meat anymore, but when I look at the tables and take 2. 3 pieces then they leave it is not the fault of the hotel but the imbeciles who eat with their eyes. It's modest, so they save money."
3895,"I have been on the phone for 4 months, already for a month the battery stopped holding and held one day and then it didn't even work for 10 hours. The next disadvantage is that the lower touch panel stopped working. The phone came back today from the warranty which was not recognized in the best way because of (mechanical damage to the port of the sim card) which was not reported to em at all, but the SITE has this I know because a similar case had a colleague who advertised the same phone before me and the complaint rejected because of a different than reported, which of course deprives the whole guarantee of the phone super patent ! ! Now I'm facing a battle by the Consumer Advocate. Very, but it's not recommended to this company and the phone because it's a crap Chinese crap! ! ! !"
3896,"As a doctor - good approach to children, unfortunately, the treatment of colds (more than 8 months) resulted in a third almond cut, two side cut, drainage in the ear. As she claimed, it is necessary to give the body to defend itself - only how much can a 3-year-old body defend itself. For 8 months he was given 6 antibiotics - different, misguided. One should add frequent private visits, paid, even control visits. After this treatment, he discharged the child from Vita and from Ms Pisarska."
3897,"I am satisfied with my stay at Station Aparthotel ! For the second time. They have nicely furnished rooms, very spacious with a kitchenette. There is a TV and there is a kettle in the kitchenette, so you can make tea at any time of day or night."
3898,"A great place to relax after the hardships of sightseeing in and around Lisbon. Very close to the metro station, next to the center of Gulbenkian and some nice restaurants. Shopping mall for those who like to accompany their wives in shopping and Campo Pequeno . The four stars that the hotel boasts are probably a little too much. The rooms need a thorough renovation. The rooms are also worth emphasizing, whose work surprises with conscientiousness and accuracy. Breakfast is really great, even after a few mornings, you can easily diversify it. The problem of the hotel's location are the planes approaching the landing, especially for those living on the north side - I recommend taking stopwatches to your ears."
3899,"The hotel, which according to the organizer Coral has 4 stars. In my opinion 2 are too much. The only thing that deserves to be done is to keep the rooms clean, clean every day, have bed linen, have a cleaner and more precise cosmetics, and have new towels every other day. Big rooms, spacious rooms with a fridge and an old TV set. The corridors look worse. . . Stained, hijacked carpets, elevator as in the communist Poland. The staff does not speak English (except for one bartender who knows the basics), the reception desk as if it was mute, good morning or thank you will not get offended here. The kitchen calls for vengeance to the sky. During the first breakfast I wanted to cry, such a poor choice she didn't see me, what I ate is not added anymore. If you don't come in the first 30 minutes, there are leftovers from previous meals, such as cabbage sauce with yoghurt, potato ball salad. With meat only chicken and unknown origin of minced meat. Alcohol in all in is only Tuborg beer, wine and gin, crayfish and very poor quality vodka. The location of the hotel compensates a little for the shortcomings."
3900,"Neutral visit . The doctor will inspire confidence, we will see how the treatment will proceed and interpret further test results. He has a lot to say, in total he is a specialist in this field. When it comes to listening to the child's parents it's neutral, at first he listens and then he feels I ignored by Dr. Brown."
3901,"Hello, unfortunately in my case the doctor ignored my nose problem and the feeling of saliva dripping down my throat that at night wakes me up with my apnea after the examination stated that I am overworked and that if on a nervous background he referred me to a psychiatrist was 'em got 'em pills nothing helped at the persuasion of my employer hit me em to a cardiologist after the holter examination it turned out that with the heart ok but there are indications of apnea I was referred to a pneumologist who performed the examination with a breathing apparatus and it turned out that I have a serious sleep disturbance through apnea then em was referred to an ENT specialist who on the first visit referred me to Upper respiratory tract CT scanner turned out that at the beginning there is a nasal septum to be done and there are also almonds to be cut out I'm just after the septum surgery I'm lying on the ward I don't have a grudge against your doctor so many patients I can make a mistake I care about time and everywhere I go I walked in private so that find out what's wrong with me walking around doctors spent about 1800 zloty plus surgery 3000 and I still have a surgery with my throat waiting for me you always have to consult a few doctors unfortunately our nfz is a tragedy terms and a man feels like an intruder I'm not a malicious man maybe I can help someone how he has symptoms like me"
3902,"I judge the Doctor very low, in my case (gastric and gastrointestinal reflux) it was not possible to achieve even minimal improvement. She was on 4 visits (on average every 3-4 weeks), took all recommended drugs (each time the change of specifications and doses), after some felt worse than before the start of treatment (bouncing, vomiting, flatulence), kept a carefully kept a diary of eaten things, limited the diet at the suggestion of the doctor most products, which resulted in losing weight. In my case, lost time, money, effort, hopes. . I am still looking for an effective doctor."
3903,"She had an ultrasound 3 times with Dr. Szuber and each time it was different. The first time was rude and unpleasant, the second time (she was with her husband) a joker and a joker, the third time he started telling stories that now every husband cheats and my husband will probably also make a leap to the side - hands fall down. As for his qualifications, I have no objections, except that the results of each time he had to consult with the attending doctor - he himself especially did not explain anything. I know that I won't visit his office with another child. My assessment is based on the fact that I expect from the doctor (each) specific and reliable information about my condition, and not to assess whether my husband will betray me."
3904,"The risk of having a heart attack in patients suffering from e.g. coronary artery disease (particularly dangerous and many people do not know they have it), obese patients with high blood pressure increases if they have a sedentary lifestyle and physical activity starts suddenly and is intense. It is important to ensure a proper warm-up and gradually increase activity. It is important to finish the exercises calmly, because a heart attack often occurs not only during the exercise but also after it is finished. Patients,"" said the doctor, ""should not engage in physical activity when it is too warm. Immediately after the exercise it is dangerous to use the sauna and take a hot shower. Exercise can also be fatal when the air temperature is low and in the mountains. Before climbing the slopes, you should wait some time for your body to get used to the new temperature and pressure."
3905,"The hotel is elegant and luxurious, it certainly deserves five stars. We have already used the New Year's Eve offer twice. Wonderfully located . The rooms are beautifully decorated clean with taste. A great advantage is the view from the windows on Lake Mikołajskie. Breakfast is abundant, wide range of dishes, everyone will find something for everyone. Although we do not eat meat, both the breakfast and lunch offer includes meatless dishes (fish, seafood), a large selection of vegetables and fruits. The service is very nice and professional, both at the reception and in the restaurant. Great facilities of the world of saunas, clean, provided water to drink, tastefully decorated. The saunas operated without reservations from the first minutes after opening. Wonderful view in the relaxation room. Swimming pool a little small but enough. The hotel is animal friendly. Our dog was delighted ; ) The only downside is: - Alcohol prices in the bar on the island (except for wine and champagne) much too high, much more expensive than in Warsaw in the best restaurants: ) The SPA treatment for men (manicure and pedicure) turned out to be a cream on hands and feet for a price of almost 400 PLN. . . ! Price absolutely not adequate to the service ! Apart from these two disadvantages, we consider the whole stay as very successful and plan to return in the summer."
3906,"The second modification allows to obtain a molecule which has strong inhibiting properties of the enzyme degrading cap, which occurs naturally in cells. According to scientists, this discovery can be used in the development of a drug for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) or other genetic disorders. ""One of the modifications we have developed can be used as a drug in the future. We have discovered a modified molecule that strongly inhibits the enzyme that degrades kapu, present in living cells. This new molecule is more than a hundred times more active than our previous inventions. Such an effect is desirable in the fight against a serious disease, which is spinal muscular atrophy"" - explained Dr Joanna Kowalska, quoted in a press release."
3907,"I don't know yet if your doctor's diagnosis is accurate. However, I know that for the first time in my life I have the impression that the doctor cares about discovering what is wrong with the patient. The visit lasted ok . 40 minutes. The doctor examined me, not like some doctors looked into my eyes and told me to touch my nose. Besides that, the doctor has the ability to get the patient out of his anxiety. I came into the office uptight and nervous, I came out maybe not healthy, but calm and smiling. I dream of such a whole health service!"
3908,"Graphical record of construction ( lecture ) Electric Boring . Slideshow . In the pictures you will not sleep or talk because it threatens to throw you out of the room, write down your names, etc . Checking the presence . Maybe so. However, he teaches things that will never come in handy (e.g. drawing a screw without simplification: ! : :) a colloquium that includes the lack of (supposedly former) Zero Tragedy . Student = vermin to avoid at all costs, if you read this post you are probably from the ellectric and this means that this gentleman is unlikely to avoid - he will get to wish you perseverance. To count is unselfishly hard. On I date passed ok . 30 people out of 200. On II only 7. It was not until 3 that the number of people in 3 was relatively loose and then most of them passed. There was also IV and for some of them V : ! : . If you did not pass on the first date, it takes into account the presence . The attendance was also the reason for the difficulties on the third date. If you were not there more than once, you got the group """
3909,"Mr. Tyc is, as someone here has already written, a specific person and if it wasn't for the fact that he prescribed me a 5.0 grade from the labs, so I didn't have to write a test on the lecture, he would have given me the worst grade. As for passing the lectureue a difficult multiple choice test in which the answers differ e.g. the presence of a comma between the definition of variables . . . questions about the type of error popping up when such and such controls are on . . . some questions cannot be answered if the code is not pasted into the pascals and the compiler does not display the answer . I think this colloquium is his revenge for his miserable attendance at lectures : ) However, in the end, all of me have passed. . ."
3910,"The very optimistic and even sensational material ""Hotel prices for Euro 2012 will jump tenfold"", published a few days ago in the ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" newspaper, has inflamed the imagination of many hotel managers. No wonder, because in this text you can read how the abstract, taken from the ceiling or pure desire, prices in facilities - especially in the Tricity - glide from 150 to over a thousand zlotys, from 200 to over 3 thousand zlotys, and so on. . Looking at these jumps you can see at first glance that they are not hotels but mostly apartments or residences. Thus, they do not offer 200 or 300 rooms, but usually several or more."
3911,"Unfortunately, I cannot give a positive assessment. I've been in pain for months. He wanted to find a good dentist. I was encouraged by positive opinions. After the tooth sealing, the pain was much greater and became unbearable. Another dentist took me in with the pain as a matter of urgency - it turned out that under the seal the pressure that caused it was being produced. The tooth finally had to be treated with a root canal. Second note: the doctor's assistant is working on the patient despite the cold, cold and cough. I find it frightening. In addition, she kept talking to the doctor, constantly distracting her. One last remark: the doctor has assessed practically the majority of my teeth as being for treatment. The second dentist, who saved me from the pain, fixed only 2 teeth and after these few months it is ok. He did not assess the remaining teeth as necessary for sealing. Maybe he just has a different approach. I can't say that the doctor was wrong. I leave the conclusions to the Reader to draw. The price of the visit: 170 PLN. Fixed 45 minutes and not a moment in more . Of course there is nothing wrong with this approach but I personally prefer to go to the Dentist who devotes as much time to the patients as they need, even if I have to wait for an appointment half an hour longer than planned."
3912,"The Doctor's office is at the Medicover Center. I had to wait half an hour for the appointment, although there was no other patient in the office. From the beginning of the visit the doctor was arrogant, she treated me as an intruder who bothered her. She brought me the results of the tests with her, she didn't even review them, she didn't listen to what problem she came with. After 5 minutes, she thanked me herself for the visit because she said that I would not ask her to examine me (although it is her duty) and she changed me to another doctor who can listen to the patient and cure him. I advise against it, waste of time! ."
3913,"informatics 2 I highly recommend ! sense of humour + positive approach to life, on passing 3 works + grade with "" nies p"
3914,"Very good conditions, restaurant, swimming pool, gym, ski rental - you can feel a lack of club or discotheque Rooms comfortable and clean. Television is a little bit unscathed (there is some internet and sometimes it gets cut) Unfortunately from next year it is said to be more expensive due to the renovation."
3915,"The hotel is not the youngest, although it is maintained in quite good condition. The biggest drawback was that the balcony of the room was on the main side and quite busy Can Picafort Street. The food was tasty and varied and the service of the restaurant and the whole hotel was nice and friendly. Special thanks are due to the resident for her kindness and help in every situation. We are generally satisfied with this trip and the place where we have been and - with a clear conscience - we can recommend it as a nice place for your holiday."
3917,"The hotel is situated in the centre, from where it is close to everywhere. The hotel has an underground car park, so you don't have to worry about where to leave your car in the centre. Bicycles can also be left in the underground car park. The hotel is clean, quiet, with a tasty breakfast buffet. From the hotel literally a few minutes to the train station. A great place as a starting point for bike trips (and there are plenty of trails in Kielce)."
3918,"A doctor with a nice disposition and a good attitude towards the patient, friendly. He was doing my gastroscopy, thanks to him, basically did not run away from the office, the examination was done well without unnecessary stress. Generally I can recommend him, he treated me at NFZ, he also wrote a referral for gastroscopy himself without any problem - I especially recommend him for this examination."
3919,"The decision to choose Mikolajska 5 for our stay in Krakow was determined by the great location (practically at the Market Square), the appearance of the offered apartments and attractive price. On site, the formalities and reception of keys went very smoothly. We chose the Antique apartment located on the top floor. First of all, it is spacious, nicely and modernly decorated and functional, and also from the side of the backyard, so it is quiet. Definitely a plus is the presence of a fully equipped kitchenette. Equally comfortable, but much louder from the street side is the apartment Brown and black, in which we also spent the night. We recommend it!"
3920,"The location of the hotel is sensational. Beach , restaurants , port . Everything at your fingertips . This hotel has been converted to Mercure this year. The entire lobby is a new smell, but at the same time there is a terrible freeze - and the staff say they were told to do so and that's it. Half the rooms are renovated, half are not. It's worth making sure twice what room it's going to be. Our room, despite the assurances, was different anyway. I hope that since my stay there have been so a little more staff. In such a large facility 1 or 2 people at the reception desk is relatively not enough."
3921,"A very good psychologist. Effective . He also has experience, not only theoretical knowledge. And very often he refers to such life practice. He can explain everything so as to look at it from a different perspective. He/she can keep up the spirit and add some energy to the action when others in your environment do the opposite. Magda does not overdo it. She's just telling the truth. She can also express a position completely opposite to ours and present the matter as it is generally perceived. That is as other people would see it. Just to deal with real life. Magda is always smiling. Honestly, she couldn't wait to see me again to throw out more problems and get some optimistic support. You know, if you don't want to solve problems yourself, nobody will do it for us. You have to want to work on yourself, and Magda can explain everything so that it is no longer a problem. Magda is a really cool, real person. I highly recommend it. Kinga"
3922,"Quite a long time has passed since the previous visit, and he was looking forward to seeing me again. Luckily, already at the reception desk, I could see that the hotel still applies the highest standards - a very nice reception, quick handling of registration formalities, how nice and professional people (special thanks to Mr Bielec). A room with a beautiful view of the Teutonic castle, large, very functional. The room is very clean and has everything necessary to make your own coffee or tea. About the quality of breakfasts I wrote in another review - standard at a very high level, wide choice, very efficient service. Clean, nice, atmospheric - definitely recommended."
3923,"It's not very pleasant what you write, I'm in a dilemma, I was on my second visit to the champ and I don't know what to do next. The most important thing is to set up the hormone treatment well and talk about it he can do. . . . . . ...you don't have to listen to him then. So who do you recommend from Łódź with such a specialization? ?"
3924,"Hotel revelation . In the very centre of the city, close to everywhere. Hotels in the highest standard. Beautiful views . Very good wifi, available throughout the hotel without restrictions. Very large and comfortable beds. Clean and tidy - I recommend to everyone for a weekend in Warsaw: ) The only thing I rate on "" ' '. - ""it's a non-functioning cork in the bathtub that wouldn't let you take a bath because the water was constantly running away."
3925,"Many of us think that revenue management and sales strategies automatically complement each other. After all, these two elements are strongly linked. We do not send stupidity: ) This perception, however, is very idealistic because in fact the sales department and the revenue management department of a hotel usually have conflicting goals they want to achieve. In many cases we see that the frustration of the hotel's revenue managers is due to the fact that the sales department wants to provide ""attractive"" prices at the least appropriate time because it involves a potential bonus and/or a short-sighted budget realization."
3926,"According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the most harmful to human health is PM 2,5 , i.e. containing the smallest particles (no more than 2,5 μm in diameter). It penetrates more easily into the lower respiratory tract, causing inflammation of the lungs, but can also penetrate (through the alveoli) into the cardiovascular system, intensifying atherosclerosis. Dr Dąbrowiecki explains that the body defends itself against atmospheric pollution by increasing mucus secretion in the airways to protect the mucous membrane, but it can also shrink the bronchi. ""The result is dyspnea and wheezing, an asthmatic reaction which is more common in allergy sufferers, and in Poland there are many - it is estimated that 40% are allergic. Poles,"" he stresses."
3927,"I think Dr. Szymula is a good specialist. She reported to him where the general practitioner was not able to diagnose what was wrong with me. Dr. Szymula directed me to various examinations on his own, excluding diseases that could cause such a fatal mood. I think that the specialist is a good one, he carries out the tests very gently and painlessly. Unfortunately the way he treats people is below criticism. I am VERY resistant to stress, but after the first visit I came out with tears in my eyes, feeling like a mentally retarded child. If a woman is expecting professional care, I recommend that you treat her like air, so that the visit is not a mental cripple."
3928,"Very good laryngologist, great surgeon. I recommend it to anyone who has any laryngological problems. She got to your doctor by a circular road, after some passing and I regret very much that she did not get to him right away. The operation was performed professionally, you could say it was painless: ) I am impressed by what he did. I must also add that the whole staff of the Laryngological Ward of the Military Hospital is amazing. All very helpful and kind (although very busy). They really are for people. Having experience with other hospitals recently, I couldn't believe that this is really happening.) I recommend your doctor and this hospital! Greetings."
3929,"I advise against it. She gave birth to my child in January 2017, from the beginning she wanted to give birth to M.S. and be prepared for the birth as well as possible, so Joanna called me in November to make an appointment and sign a contract for midwife services during the birth. The deadline was New Year's Eve 2016 and Joanna warned me that she wouldn't be there on Christmas, but she didn't want me to worry, because even if I start giving birth in her absence, she will provide a decent replacement. Apart from holidays, Mrs. Joanna was to be available at any other time of day or night - I was assured of that. On the 8th of January around 22nd the contractions started (I was already in pathology at the hospital on Madalińskiego Street). Unfortunately, one of the midwives on duty told me that Joanna could not come to me because she had to sleep before the duty and could come, but only about 3 in the morning. Joanna could have warned me earlier that such situations may occur, they would simply protect us from such a situation - she would have hired another midwife, a doula, she simply did not want me to give birth alone (her husband was more stressed than I was). Mrs. Joanna finally arrived at 3 am, after 5 hours that we spent with my husband practically alone in the delivery room. The evaluation was neutral, and not negative, because one of the last 3 hours of the birth was nice and pleasant. I would like to add that unfortunately Joanna did not ask me for my consent at the incision and despite the absence for the most part of the birth she issued an invoice for the entire amount of the service. Despite the good first impression she made on us, in my opinion, she did not fulfill the contract - she came much late and did not take care of the blockage during her absence."
3930,"Excellent location, right next to the castle. In the season in the evenings it can be quite loud. . . .but this is the price for a place in the very centre of town. A very climatic place, very stylishly decorated, clean and neat. In our room the bathroom needs a slight adjustment, but this is a really small problem: - ) Room on the 2nd floor with a tiny window overlooking the ... . window of the building opposite : - ) Hot in hot weather, despite the fan/air conditioner in the room. Very tasty breakfasts, a large selection, great coffee. Nice manager, very helpful. Generally, service is nice and helpful. Tasty dishes in the hotel restaurant, but certainly not the cheapest. . . Generally, the overall assessment of the facility is as positive as possible."
3931,"Easy physics entry, for reports if they are on the subject gives 5 . Very cool, if you don't know something you are willing to help. Stress-free classes : D"
3932,"He was gentle, he showed me the ovaries, he laughed. He told me exactly what he was doing, what he was looking for and how long it would still take. Suddenly a nurse came in informing me that they had a girlfriend with such acute pains that she was fainting and when she left she did not close the door. He saw my horror. He apologized, closed the door earlier by drawing the nurse's attention. He said that she must wait because she is currently examining the patient. She saw that he was in no hurry, he treated me really like a woman, not objectively and in a hurry. She was very pleased with me, I have to look for where she is taking her next time I go."
3933,"Mr. Dr. Klauz is a great doctor, nice and trusting to the patient. He operated on my father in ""urgent procedure"" after a spinal fracture injury. The operation performed by Dr. Klauz gave a chance to function normally without pain and avoid permanent disability. Thank you very much for your wonderful care and attention. Not often do you meet doctors like Dr. Klauz. I must also add that the whole staff of the neurosurgery department of St. Raphael's Hospital is an incredible support for the patient. I recommend the Doctor and St. Raphael's Hospital, with such good care and concern for the patient ""you get sick differently"" . Grzegorz Stokłosa"
3934,"Calmness - that's what we said after arriving in Starigrad - the more so as we spent the night before in Makarska. Swimming pool, sea a stone's throw from the hotel, free parking, mini supermarkets nearby, clean room, modern clean bathroom, good, hearty breakfast, very nice and helpful staff and the smell of pines and nearby mountains are undoubted advantages of the hotel and its location. Despite its size, the hotel is quiet and peaceful. Lazy, holiday atmosphere. We regret that we could not use the attractions of Paklenica. It was a very successful stop on the way to Plitivce Lakes."
3935,"The reality is not the same as the pictures from the offer, the bathrooms are dirty, the corridors smell of dirty carpet. The hotel is connected to the hostel, we got a hostel room, with an exit to a dirty little space limited by walls and some kind of ventilation devices, in addition, without hot water. After the intervention hot water was turned on and after three nights we were moved to a room on the 2nd floor. The room is of a slightly better standard, although the devices in the bathroom have already been partly used up and are not thoroughly washed. Unfortunately, the heat (the room directly under the roof) and the lack of proper ventilation (only the roof window in the bathroom, the room had a window bricked up with luxers) did not allow you to sleep peacefully, it cooled down only around 6 am. The staff is nice, but I really felt cheated by the clash with reality. She would have preferred to pay more, but to get a fair offer rather than retouched photos."
3936,"She was on her first visit to Dr. Ufnalewski yesterday. Nice, helpful, introduces an atmosphere of peace. She forgot to ask me, however, what kind of hospital she works in, does she work in the hospital at all or just run her private office? If any of you would know, please answer me in advance, thank you."
3937,"I had some concerns going to the professor after reading the following opinions. He turned out to be a very nice and competent doctor, collected a thorough interview, explained everything in an accessible way. In front of me there was a very noisy, talkative person and also patiently listened to her (as opposed to waiting :)) I do not know how my treatment will end but at the moment I am very happy with this visit. The cost is not really low."
3938,"Specific , All research is done on the spot right away. You always leave the office with your diagnosis. She can help you on your first visit. I have been going to her for a few years now. She has been pregnant by a few of my friends, and they also have positive opinions about the Doctor."
3939,"There is no face to face interaction and although it is automated it is still individualized. It is therefore worthwhile to invest in the guests we already have, often finding hidden revenue potential in them. This is because a regular visitor is often treated routinely, when we close the possibility of increasing income on him/her. However, there is still a lot of work to be done before the hotels on the subject of the relationship."
3940,"I would advise against this doctor. I was at his place and he said I should be cured. She asked him if the ointment or suppositories were not enough and he said that I should be put in hospital and anesthetized in general. She was scared of me because she never wanted me to be put to sleep. The doctor said that he could not give local anesthesia because if he puts on my sight glass I can not stand it and in pain I want to jump over the wall. After this visit I was not satisfied so she went to another proctologist. She had a rectroscope on which it turned out that I have hemorrhoids and polyp which will have to be removed, but it can be done in the office with a proctologist under local anesthesia. I do not know on what basis this doctor said that something has to be cured if he examined me only with a finger."
3941,"I do not recommend this hotel. The room has very low lighting and heating. No hairdryer in the bathroom . Meals in the restaurant at strictly defined hours such as dinner only from 17 to 18 . Apart from that, hot dishes only in summer, a Swedish table with a modest menu, stale bread. You can have reservations about the restaurant service: some kind of immobile, immobile and late, dirty serviettes on the tables with filled to the limit containers for waste. The hotel closes at 11 p.m., and those coming back later must ask to be let into the hotel by phone. The pool is small (cold water), but you can swim, next to the Jacuzzi (cold water!). For our attention regarding the water temperature we received the answer ""that it must mix with the water in the pool"" ! ? The parking lot is worth laughing at because it is only a few places at the entrance to the building, without any protection, even unfenced, for which a fee of 10zł is charged. When you check out a very long waiting time for the staff, pretending that you pay by card. We only spent the weekend, but we sympathize with the patients who are there for three weeks. The atmosphere is depressing."
3942,"I don't think I'm recommending you, Dr. Bishop. I was on a visit once, and Dr. Haydn didn't trust me. The visit is very fast, Dr. Bishop is a bit chaotic. Several times during the visit he fell asleep, interpreting the results, he underestimated a few abnormal ones. Besides, the doctor is terribly reticent and answers the question very quickly. The visit is actually limited to interpreting the tests and writing a prescription, even the gynaecological tests are not performed. However, I cannot accuse Dr. ""rude"". For me he is a nice and smiling doctor, he tried to relax the atmosphere through numerous jokes: ) . In general, when it comes to treatment, I advise against it. The fact is that Dr. does not prescribe contraceptive pills so immediately, but also: you will not find out what is wrong with you, if the pills will help you. . ."
3943,"Ms. Sabina is a great professional who knows what she does. After a year of unsuccessful therapy with another speech therapist, we finally turned to Mrs. Sabina and it was a great move. Every time Ms. Sabina explained the purpose of the exercises. Repeating them at home and the speech therapist's massage resulted in the right positioning of the sounds. What is important is that Sabina has great patience with children, who are not always enthusiastic about the therapy. A few years ago, she also quickly and effectively led my father out of facial nerve paralysis, so she is great not only at working with children. I highly recommend!"
3944,"The above is a list of tasks that they perform on a daily basis, apart from their basic duties connected with serving guests at the reception desk - receptionists of many small 3-star hotels ""somewhere in Poland"". Is 1 . 400 zloty ""on hand"" with night hours and work on Sundays - is it much or little for doing all the above mentioned work? Should receptionists in a 3-star hotel do such work at all? The answer to these questions depends on several conditions: how big is a 3-star hotel, i.e. how many rooms and other areas it has; where is it located, how high is the attendance, and how does the seasonality look like. And finally: how do we approach the employee billing system. 160 room 3-star hotel located in the center of Warsaw, Wroclaw or Poznan, where the traffic of guests and clients lasts practically from 6 am. 00 am to 2 am. It is impossible to compare it to a 12 - 20 room holiday hotel located in the depths of the Warmińsko-Mazurskie Voivodeship or to a city hotel in a small county town. The receptionist from a big city hotel and the receptionist from a small local hotel are two different employees."
3945,Hello Opinions are different this is my very nice place in a good neighborhood nice helpful staff and it's so much good room I rented knew em that it is small and met my expectations owner however at all costs from a cool one trying to make a double room luckily was em alone the bed is a complete catastrophe old smashed with a 5 cm thick mattress hard not comfortable two nights not sleeping the price of 80 PLN for a night exaggerated for sleeping on the floor did not get me any payment confirmation just the key and I wish the owner such comforts that Andrzej himself funds his guests
3946,"Who : Dr. I . Rutkowska Course : inorganic chemistry II exercise . Evaluation: I highly recommend [ / b ] Mrs. Dr. Rutkowska is nice, smiling and most importantly - she explains well. She has time for students on consultations, one of the best teachers. I highly recommend!"
3947,"Nice hotel, clean, relatively modern and comfortable. Breakfast in the form of an abundant Swedish table. During the stay there were a few problems: - failure of the paddling pool and flooded bathroom (including part of the room) - a powerful renovation of the whole plumbing - a team of workers bullets with powerful hammers and other tools - they started before 8:00 a.m. and finished about 4:00 p.m: 00 - during breakfast, you would have to wait about 20 minutes to fill up with scrambled eggs and steam, even though you asked for a slip If it was quiet and the food was waiting on the table, you could come back after checking by phone that everything was OK. It is worth checking other hotels in Tczew."
3948,"He was em 2 times in March and June. The first time was a great kitchen, in the season smaller portions, less tasty - I think the cook has changed. One waiter and a waitress ok, but one ( younger ) not nice. Rooms are generally ok, original wardrobe - changing rooms. To the rooms and cleanliness no accusations. Sauna is paid extra probably 35 zł. Location very good ! Close to the harbor, only parking lot sucks - the car is all dirty with ashes "" balcony smokers "" ."
3949,"What captivates from the very beginning, besides the location, is the hospitality of the whole staff, the man feels like at home. Everybody is very nice, kind and helpful, this is the biggest plus of the Green Glade Centre. The kitchen is also worthy of praise - homemade and very tasty. A lot of attractions especially for children. A good base for trips to nearby attractions and places worth seeing. Interesting access especially the one through the mountains : - ) I recommend investing in a small spa or jacuzzi by the pool. Generally, a great secluded place to relax and unwind in a very nice family atmosphere."
3950,"Beata Mielczarek I have b . good impressions . She anesthetized me during the gynaecological procedure. She felt great after waking up. The woman noticed that I was in a bad mental state, she gave me something that made me feel better. She felt extremely well afterwards. She gave me a lot of attention. A lot of culture, and it's different. Sometimes when I talk to the doctor I feel like I'm being treated like half a person."
3951,"The first and I hope this is the last time that we've ever been able to see this lady. The child is less than 2 years old, sick, irritated, scared, and from the side of the doctor she has no empathy, only ice and soldier's orders. After this visit the doctor's office will not associate our child well, although so far it has not had major problems with the medical examination. Although I hope that the diagnosis was accurate and the prescribed drugs will help. . ."
3952,"Hotel as in the title. The Comfort Room does not resemble that from the photos from the website . Wooden, dirty squeaky windows and balcony doors. In the wardrobe only 2 shelves for clothes (top and bottom) so it's a bar and hangers. On tv 4 polish channels with 13 available . No kettle, cups and dryers in the room or ropes on the balcony. There are 4 floors in the building and the elevators are missing, but the tiles on the stairs are glued silvertape. The restaurant has a buffet breakfast, a lot of cold snacks, only one hot one. Dinner served - soup and a choice of two sets. Paid drinks! Not even water or tea. Tasty food. The hotel has a playroom, but as in the picture, nothing stunning. Older children can play the xbox. Outside there is plenty of space for running and a playground. Parking is payable 20 PLN / day . To the centre of Miedzyzdroje 3km after destroyed slabs, massacre. The beach is about 600 metres away. Generally not recommended. For this money it is better to rent a room in the centre."
3953,"A modest but very clean and well-kept hotel in the heart of Riga's Old Town. The location is ideal . A special plus for a very nice, very friendly service - despite the fact that a room of a different standard was booked than it was described on the sales page of the intermediary - full commitment of the hotel staff to explain the situation and change the room as soon as possible! A big plus ! And I will not mention about the details such as the suggestion of sightseeing in the direction of going to the seaside on the last day of nice weather. . . ."
3954,"The hotel was supposed to be typical of the UK, but unfortunately it turned out to be below the level. The lack of a reception is not surprising, but you would expect a better service than the waiter who was just coming back from the restaurant room. The room was so small that when you opened your suitcase you could practically only lie on your bed. Standard breakfast, British breakfast - nothing special. He didn't use 'em in the restaurant, so I won't write about it."
3955,"Photos retouched ! Syphilis and grave in place ! The hotel is dark, toys for children destroyed. Owners unpleasant . Such a little wild west. The setting on catching a deer that will not come back anymore."
3956,"Beautiful and very clean hotel and nice service. Delicious and varied food, every evening a theme dinner (Cretan, Italian, Mexican, etc.). Great alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages in bars. The hotel is not oriented towards families with children, so it is quiet and peaceful. The hotel is located in the centre of a small but lively village (shops, bars, restaurants open until late). Very close to the beach, beach service paid (two deck chairs + umbrella 10 euros for the whole day). There is a bus stop a few minutes away from the hotel, from where you can get by bus to Heraklion (ticket costs 4 euros) or to the east of the island (e.g. to Agios Nikoalos). I recommend it !"
3957,"Mrs. Camilla helped me find the causes of my problems. Thanks to that I understand my own behaviour better and deal with it better. Talking to Ms. Kamila acted as a catalyst to work out the problems. Ms. Kamila listens carefully to the client, remembers the interviews and is able to draw conclusions from the conversation, which allow to look at her own situation from a new, innovative perspective. When the weekly visits were no longer necessary, Mr. Kamila did not insist on maintaining a high frequency of meetings - I am not afraid that the psychologist wanted to ""stretch"" patients. Only the waiting room in Mr. Kamila's private office would be useful."
3958,"According to the sociologist from Łódź, over the last half-century we can observe a permanent increase in the importance of cancer among the causes of death and a decrease in the significance of infectious diseases. According to the data of the Central Statistical Office, in 1960 cancer was the cause of 8.9% of all deaths, and in 2010. - 25.3% in 2010. Infectious diseases constituted in 1960. Infectious diseases constituted 6.9% of all deaths, and in 2010 only 0.7%. Cardiovascular diseases have been the predominant cause of death for many years, although this trend has been slowly decreasing over the last several years. In 1990 cardiovascular diseases were the cause of 53.4% of all deaths, and in 2010 the number of deaths was lower. - 46% of all deaths in 2010 ."
3959,"""Therefore, in pathological states, when the immune system is too stimulated or its activity lasts too long, the consequences of dysfunction of other systems are more and more severe. As a result, the immune system destroys the body instead of protecting it. If we could block the influence of pro-inflammatory cytokines on a cell, then the immune system would not damage other systems,"" explains a doctoral student of the Faculty of Biology at the University of Warsaw. Originally it was believed that specialized information particles in the body are characteristic of certain systems, e.g. neurotransmitters for the immune system and cytokines for the immune system. It was assumed that it is a ""code"" which communicates with the cells within their system, not understood by other cells. Nowadays scientists know that this view was false, and receptors for cytokines and neurotransmitters can be found in most of the cell population."
3960,"Great food, great treat for guests with platinum status. Plus a terrible restaurant service. The waitress disappeared for 40 minutes! ! There's nothing you can do, no order and no payment! In all hotels Accor gets a fast check - out and here's ZERO! When preparing the stay, I have marked who the invoice should be. The lady at the reception couldn't cope with it and ended up with a manual data entry. It was one of the best Novotels in Poland, but it is probably the worst. Except for the waiter's bald waiter, you should throw out the whole ""old guard"" because they take care of themselves and not the guests. The reception desk is incompetent, incompetent."
3961,"From the beginning - quick, efficient and trouble-free check-in. Large room, very clean. Gardening bed, tall, extremely comfortable, very comfortable bedding, double cushions for everyone. Equipment - kettle, various teas, sugar, delicious coffee and cream, free bottle of drinks for everyone, fridge, cups, glasses. . . . Besides, an iron, a dryer. . . . . . .etc. Bathroom cleaner plus cosmetic set . Quiet, calm, no planes. Crossing to the airport straight from the hotel ""two steps"" just across the street. A great place especially before the very early departure to enter the airplane, sleepy, relaxed and not tired after a few hours of night travel by car. . . I strongly recommend this hotel! Description and photos of the hotel and the rooms show the real situation."
3962,"I spent one night here training a certain company's customers. The hotel was situated high in the mountains with a nice view of the surrounding area, unfortunately I had a room with a view of the forest located on the mountain where the hotel stood. Lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant less than average. Tasty breakfasts . The room itself as well as the corridors need to be renovated, wiped carpets, upholstered furniture, wiped switches, towels asking for a replacement - five stars is not good enough. Nice panoramic elevator. The car park is badly located, you have to climb up to the hotel entrance. The lecture halls failed, were conducted simultaneously two training sessions were asked to turn off the microphones because we were jamming each other. With the rest, the acoustics throughout the hotel is tragic. I with dinner went out em before I had a room on the 5th floor and heard 'em play music of the band playing in the restaurant on level 0 . I think 5 whistle is really too much. The hotel service is impeccable."
3963,"Rest stay 11 days within 12 . 2015 , family 2 + 2 ( 5 and 7 years ) . The price was attractive and we knew what we were deciding on. We knew that, - all inclusive is in good weather 12 - 21 : 30 for selected drinks and alcohols from the cheapest garages, - the children's pool is tiny and shallow, and larger too deep for our children, - we expected to eat monotonous food, - we expected to have to eat the remains of the New Year's Eve party for the next few days, - no GSM coverage in the hotel (peace and quiet). We were surprised: - lack of possibility to call from the room / room to a landline phone, even after notification (7 days is not enough to repair), - not enough service in the bar / restaurant, which practically runs to keep up with customer service, - very monotonous food, small fruit and vegetables, - closed after 22 Mon - C (both the entertainment area and the restaurant) - there is nowhere to go and you have to go and sleep, - children's playroom - not suitable for children's games, - football table football - generally no corners for children, you have to organize on your own."
3964,"Initially, we booked a tourist room (with a shared bathroom and toilet in the hallway) - unfortunately, the failure (even a low price did not manage to prevail). After the change (no problem) and the surcharge to the apartment with a bathroom - a different reception - a large room, a nice bathroom, a nice view of the old town's climatic street, dressing gowns, slippers, etc.. The service is nice, competent and helpful. Knowledge of languages (including Polish) very good. The building is an old, historic tenement house exterior facade and overall impression good. Unfortunately, inside the building is a complete renovation - although the building has its own climax. For more sensitive aesthetes it is unacceptable. Breakfast buffet, fresh products, good quality, tasty and varied (for the first few days super). However, with a longer stay they unfortunately become monotonous because every day it is the same. The biggest advantage is the location - it is simply great. Very good communication from and to the airport (marshrutka - autobusik no. 48 access approx. 40min / 4 hryvnia)."
3965,"Hello : ) My husband has a very serious backbone problem, he has two discs at 4mm and 8mm, the doctor said that my husband has a 50 year old spine and my husband is only 35 years old. Two orthopaedists and a neurosurgeon are diagnosed with surgery! We have a big dilemma now what to do? Because we are afraid of the surgery, the family is not helping us, but the suffering of the husband is great. Janicki is a good doctor? and please tell us approximately how much this surgery is going to cost? Thank you in advance. ANIA"
3966,"Hotel 4 * - the joke of the year, everything was stuck with dirt, starting from the room where we were accommodated with a view of the slope thrown by the pampers, where the lack of grass was masked by a ""military"" net to the elevator. For 200 rooms and several floors in total, there was only 1 elevator. A bush driving tourists to the seaside? For a whole week he didn't even see a sand brush. Spiders and temples in the room, completely without seeing problems employees. After reporting the vermin, they stuffed the bathroom ( only ! ! ! ) with some kind of shit, they opened the bars and that's it. They did not even clean up the vermin! ! For a week after our intervention at the reception desk, they ""cleaned"" once, i.e. they threw in rolls of toilet paper, washed the toilet and went. They didn't even properly fill the bed. No towel change. In addition, an attempted fraud on the part of the hotel staff, for taking the towels to the beach we paid 20 Lv. When at the end of their stay they wanted to get the money back, we found out that the towels had already been returned. . The question is only by whom? No words simply. In the hotel a lot of families with not raised brats, because otherwise you can not call it that. Lack of tiles in the pool. Pool area black from dirt. If the water has poured out of the pool, there was a ""wet note"" sign and you waited for it to dry itself. . If you want to spoil the holiday for which you have waited half a year or even a year, I recommend it."
3967,"There are several reasons for this. First, data on the metabolism of drugs, such as cocaine, are from the 1950s. . . .the 1950s. For ethical reasons, no one today volunteers are testing the pharmacokinetics of narcotics, so there are no new data. Moreover, the metabolism of these compounds is always slightly different in healthy people and in addicts and this is not taken into account in these studies. A very big error is caused by the sewage system - how old it is and to what extent it leaks. Studies in Germany and Switzerland show that during leaks and overflows after rains, about 50% of wastewater may not reach the treatment plant. In addition, the value of the flows reported by the treatment plant is affected by an error of about 20% . In addition, some substances degrade along the way."

Dr. Witek was diagnosed with general weakness and stabbing in the chest (the doctor is also an internist). Thanks to a thorough history and commissioned examinations it turned out very quickly that I have hypothyroidism, which - if not discovered in time - would be very confusing in my plans to enlarge the family.) The doctor quickly adjusted the hormones, I immediately got the desired pregnancy and was under his care all the time. It is thanks to Dr. Witek that I still have such results, as if I had no problems with my thyroid: ) I recommend it mainly because of the great knowledge, competence and intuition, but also because the doctor is a nice person: )"
3970,"My first stay at the KRYNICA Hotel and certainly the last. The small swimming pool, the room for rest after leaving the sauna has not enough sun loungers and you have to stand or walk after leaving. The food is very good, the service on the kitchen and the restaurant is great but the reception and the management - TRAVEL! ! ! When leaving the hotel for the car, the wife slipped on the uncovered and unspoiled parking lot and broke down severely. When I went to report the incident at the reception was not able to hear (supposedly no one from the management was at work that day). They wrote us an e-mail when we came back home. . . . until today we have not heard a word of apology, because I think it is an oversight. They sent us back to the insurer in order to liquidate the loss, but they did not send explanations, monitoring ito . . . . . . .which makes it impossible to pay compensation for inability to work after the accident. Scandal - do not recommend . There are many hotels at this price with a better standard and approach. . : )"
3971,"I am pleased with the visit, which was quick, concrete and the diagnosis was correct. Despite the registration via the Internet at 20 Zagorska Street, a text message reminded me all the time that the visit will take place in Centermed at 126 Piekoszowska Street? . It is interesting because the doctor there has never taken it. This is the only disadvantage associated with the current technique."
3972,"Every 5 - 6 - 7 years each of our hotels requires some work: changes of decoration, modernization, new furniture or TV equipment etc. At present, work is being carried out in the next 7 facilities, and we are planning to do it in the next 7 - 10. (The strategic plan for the years 2009 - 2012 has adopted a budget of 168.9 million euros. At the same time, 21 facilities will be renovated."
3973,"I've been treating your doctor for several years now, so far I had no objections, but during his last visit he was very nervous, not very gentle. Honestly speaking (despite the best opinions about the doctor so far) after leaving the office she was thinking about changing the doctor. . ."
3974,"She came to visit me hoping to help cure the disease, with which I was already with several other doctors without success. And we start with the standard: examination, assignment of pills (showed me a list of those that I took earlier and did not help), subsequent visits, subsequent pills + hormones + ointment + globules. Next visit , no changes . Another prescription . Until recently, buying the assigned medication and taking it had m deja vu . It is hard to remember the names of the drugs, and she believed that Dr. Malinowska has written down the course of treatment and she would not even think that this would happen. She took the newly purchased medication for 1 day and then found in the drawer a residue of ointment which she used a few months earlier and which was identical to the present one. Conclusion? She was given m 2 times exactly the same prescription for exactly the same set of medications a few months apart. Nice money wasted and great disappointment. Dr. Malinowska is good at assigning pills . You want to start eating hormones ? I recommend it. . . ."

It also provides diagnostic possibilities, allows the assessment of muscle strength, electrical activity in the patient's muscles and measurement of the range of movement. It will be the only robot available in the world that uses EMG, that is electromyography. It gives a chance for active rehabilitation - using electrical activity appearing in the muscles of even weak patients. The robot was developed in Poland, especially for physiotherapists. It has already passed the first tests with the participation of patients - volunteers. ""We had a patient in Wrocław - Jakub, who moved his hands for the first time in five years thanks to our robot. This patient would not have been able to participate in rehabilitation of another type, like the one with the exoskeleton"" - says Mikulski ."

3977,"And it was the sales of Sheraton in Kraków and Bristol in Warsaw that made the market value in 2013. This year, at least so far, similar transactions have not been recorded, although in ub . The sale of Warsaw's Westin and Radisson Blu Centrum hotels on Grzybowska Street has been discussed. They are selling because they do not earn any money Most of the hotels are currently for sale due to the fact that their owners cannot cope with the increasingly competitive market. They are primarily smaller, older and most often not hotel facilities. Such facilities can be purchased for several hundred thousand to several million PLN. The second, less numerous group are facilities belonging to companies which dispose of them due to restructuring or cessation of accommodation activity."
3978,"She was at your doctor's for a visit with my four-month-old child. The son had dry skin on his cleavage and scaly skin on his neck, after one time he was rubbing the pimples on his neck with an ointment with a small amount of zinc oxide (the pimples disappeared but the skin dried up). She was counting on a good ointment made on prescription, unfortunately we got a steroid + syrup so the little one would not scratch. I am one of those people who read the leaflets from A to Z, and she said that I will not give these medicines to the child, the syrup was in the leaflet ""for children from 2 years old"". and the steroid seems to me to be the last resort, but my son only had a skin problem for 2 days. She consulted my pediatrician with my medication, she reacted to the syrup: ""God forbid, it's too small for such medication"". and the neck had to be lubricated with an ordinary emollient cream, after 3 days the skin regenerated and the problem disappeared."
3979,"My doctor refused to write a reimbursed prescription online. I have been treating myself for years, the whole medical history and everything is in the system in the facility I have been attending for years and I don't even know what was the reason for the refusal. I'm sitting at home with a small child and unfortunately I can't go to the doctor every month, especially as she would have to take the baby with her. Which I can't allow. Unfortunately I'm forced to go to the first better free doctor because I'm going to see a doctor next month."
3980,"The doctor tried very hard to help me, which she cannot be refused. The advantage is that the next consultations after finally unsuccessful attempts of treatment were free of charge, although after 4 months of these attempts I am still sick and I was sent back to another doctor, where I have an appointment in 2 weeks. With my condition, 2 weeks of waiting is far too long, especially since I have been struggling with the problem for over six months. . ."
3981,"Everything would be fine if it wasn't for the receptionist, who treats the customer in a very pretentious way and looks like he's just about to go out on the beaches. The man at the reception desk has probably forgotten where he is and he talks to his guests like he talks to his friends at vodka. No professionalism. Going with guests to ""you"" and insulting is already a definite exaggeration . I advise against this place because of the situation."
3982,"We were the whole family in Sosence: 2 + 2 . They booked us a 2-level apartment. The surroundings are peaceful, quiet, beautiful coniferous forests. The town itself is rather empty. Although it was the middle of a holiday and a long weekend, there were very few people. One main street with only 3 ice cream parlours and 2 pizzerias. Unfortunately there was a ban on swimming in the lake, so we did not take advantage of it. I do not know if this is why the nearby beach was completely closed, but even the restaurant was empty. In the resort next door you can rent water bikes, mountain bikes and other equipment. There are bicycle and hiking trails in the area. Sosenka is a small centre, only 10 or 12 cottages, fenced, which gave us, as parents of school children, the freedom to let them loose throughout the centre. The cottages themselves are nice, renovated and equipped. I somehow suggested that it would be two rooms, and unfortunately it was one room where two sofa beds see each other. Sleeping quality is medium, because, however, these are narrow sofa beds. If somebody is ordinary to sleep on a normal 160 cm bed, they may not get any sleep. Especially since the standard is one duvet for 2 people. Towels on the equipment are supposed to be, but one small towel per person. A little too little. An interesting option is to combine rooms within one house. On the one hand it's nice, because the bigger team has communication without going outside, but on the other hand you can hear the neighbors."
3983,"""Our device has been in existence for several months now, however, to be able to sell it, it must undergo clinical trials. All these centres will be invited to a clinical trial. This stage we want to finish in 2018"" - plans the PAP caller.

In the final stage of the world finals, which will end with a conference in Amsterdam, prizes from the pool of 800 thousand dollars will be awarded."
3984,"With an overall positive assessment, a big problem for me is the lack of contact with the Doctor outside of visits to the Medical Center "" Help "" . It is difficult to enroll in an appointment because of the long deadlines, and in neurological diseases there are situations where a quick consultation is needed. The doctor gives himself a phone number, asks for a text message with the results of the examination, promises to answer in the evening and unfortunately does not do it. And it really is not about trivial matters. The daughter suffers from epilepsy and if it wasn't for online contact with parents of other sick children it would be difficult for us without doctor's support."
3985,"In the Charlotte Valley she was m on a week-long holiday in July 2012 . My husband and I came here encouraged by a beautiful website and advertising on the radio. Unfortunately, the water, which in the pictures looks like a lake on the spot turns out to be 2 ponds, where there was once the possibility of fishing, but renting equipment, and even fishing was so expensive that probably quickly this idea fell down (there were information boards). The zoo was very nice, the Mongolian village is rather a misunderstanding, the pool is quite big. The room was pretty enough, but without a balcony or terrace, the food was unfortunately bad, and at least the Swedish buffet was too poor (e.g. . all the salads were with vinegar and nothing to choose from for someone who does not eat vinegar and likes vegetables). I think this place is good, but only for the weekend and it's best if there's a nice concert."
3986,"Medium-quality hotel during one week's stay did not see anyone at the reception. . . I guess I wasn't in the cleaning room at all, even the towel I had after someone smeared with ink to the masses. The TV sometimes didn't want to run or the picture got darker, you had to move the cable. Breakfast was very modest and of medium quality. . . Beds for this comfortable and large rooms"
3987,"The hotel's reputation and the reputation of the chain have increased by similar values. The facilities such as free breakfast (up from 70 to 73%) and the possibility of later check-out (up from 65% to 69%) have also gained in importance for hotel guests. Criteria related to free internet access in the room (from 63 to 75%) and public spaces (from 45% to 53%) are also increasingly important for guests. Likewise, guests can view photos or videos and read about the hotel: on the hotel's website (up from 47% to 52%) or on websites such as Expedia, Travelocity (up from 48% to 52%) as well as on blogs and social media (up from 33% to 41%) . The MMGY Global report points to the stabilization or decline in the importance of criteria aggressively promoted by hotels in recent years, such as: better soundproofed rooms, top-quality bedding, additional points in loyalty programs, and free press."
3988,"""Eating even one donut can be a burden on the body. A doughnut is high in calories and contains a lot of sugar - if it wasn't, it probably wouldn't taste good. Yeast dough, filling, icing - all this has a lot of sugar. In addition, the doughnut is soaked in fat, in which it is baked,"" - said Dr. Moor - Jankowski to PAP. Eating doughnuts is a challenge for several organs - stomach, pancreas and liver. People who suffer from pancreatitis or chronic liver diseases should avoid these delicacies. ""The excess calories that the body will consume must be used up somehow. If a person doesn't burn it and instead sits in front of the TV, it has to be put down and most often it is put down in the liver first"" - explained the doctor."
3989,"I'm literally angry, I feel cheated by this company. Nizoral came out on the market to buy also in sachets. She bought me one sachet. I understand that if a manufacturer launches a product in this form, then using it should be enough for once. NONE. The product is not very efficient, and since the sachet has 6 ml, it is not able to cover it or wash its head thoroughly. I would like to point out that I am the owner of long hair, she put on my hair in advance before buying it, that there will definitely not be enough product for the whole hair, she was counting on me only to cover the scalp, but unfortunately it was not enough. And as far as the efficacy of the product is concerned, she wanted me to write something, but unfortunately she did not find out anything because of the problem mentioned above. I'm very sorry and I'm sorry."
3990,"Generally, the keyboard is even cool . It lies well in the hand and works on many operating systems (tested on: Android, Debian, Windows 7). However, it has some annoying drawbacks: - when you press the touchpad instead of the effect of a left click, the effect of holding the left button is followed. At first I thought it was broken so I sent em a couple of times for warranty because they couldn't deal with it. Finally, under warranty, he got em a new keyboard and it turned out to work identically. - The device every once in a while during use likes to go into standby mode (fortunately it can quickly return to normal operation), - text scrolling with the touchpad is too sensitive . It seems to be possible to adjust it, but in my opinion a little too little ."
3991,"This is confirmed by an experiment carried out in China in 2009. In which silver nanoparticles and microparticles were injected under rat skin. The microparticles did not enter the bloodstream, while the nanoparticles were transported to the kidneys, liver, spleen, lungs and brain. The tattooing process consists in introducing a small amount of pigment under the skin by means of pricking. Tattooing can also be dangerous to human health due to skin damage and the possibility of infections. As explained by Dr. Teresa Bilewicz - Wyrozumska from the Chair and Department of Environmental Health of the Department of Public Health in Bytom, while maintaining the rules of hygiene such a risk is minimal. ""The general rule for every procedure where our tissue is affected should be to open the needle pack or the device tip in our presence"" - she emphasized ."
3992,"The answer is simple. Economy hotel . Savings on materials - especially bathrooms - give unpleasant results. It is not possible to seal shower cabins indefinitely with silicone, it is finally starting to disturb. But to the point. Location of the hotel - good, contrary to its name - in the New Town, that is a little bit behind the Old Town. ""A little"", that is, a pleasant walk away. Reception service - very efficient and professional, cleanliness OK . Room tidied up, bathroom to be renovated, which has already been mentioned. The minus for the room locking system - card readers act as indicators in an old joke: it works - it does not work . And it wasn't just my problem, I saw 'em a couple of times in the hallway frustrated guests trying to understand why the introduction of a card results in the green light flashing, its lighting up, and. . . . . .nothing more. Generally, for economy class hotels, the middle zone of the middle states. In this respect, Ibis Reduta is slightly better (probably because it is newer), but that is another matter."
3993,"~ Forgive me. I disagree with you. A woman's psyche, especially during pregnancy is very important. A lot depends on a woman's attitude. Unfortunately, from the very beginning the doctor threatened me with a vision of an unfulfilled pregnancy, stuffed me with medication, the effect: a dead pregnancy. I am glad that this diagnosis was heard from another doctor, who can show the patients a heart, and if necessary - will cheer them up in such a difficult moment, will try to explain, rationally, although gently. I think it is possible to reconcile the human approach with the professionalism of the doctor. Unfortunately, Mr. Milewicz misses the former. As for the professionalism. . . . .well, when I got pregnant, he told me to stop the drugs twice on the phone. And during the visit he shouted that I shouldn't have done it because I could hurt the baby. . ."
3994,"The hostel was quite squalid, the room was noisy, the carpet was deeply stained, under the bed there were other people's worn out ear sticks. Towels smelled of chemistry. The bar lacked an interesting vegetarian / vegan option. On the terrace outside the window was extremely dull (cigarettes, rotten apples, bottles with multi-day cola, condom packages)."
3995,"The hotel is not cheap, but has quite a good location - not far from the metro. The reception is open 24 hours. Generally ok. The room is small but clean, the bathroom is also small but clean. Only such small shortcomings: and this socket does not work by the bed, and it is a shelf loose in the bathroom, from which everything comes off, and it is a torn socket in the bathroom. . . For the price they offer, I expected a little better standard. We were with Mommy only 2 nights and mainly visited so we didn't have any major objections. The service was very nice : )"
3996,"We spent a great holiday in this hotel. The only downside is the bathrooms: dark, small, with very small shower cabins. Besides, nice hotel staff, very good meals. Great animations in French and Polish, which created a holiday atmosphere. In the evenings dances to 1 : 30 . Lodges by the pool and on the beach for free. For towels there is a deposit of 10 euros per piece. In 20 minutes on foot you can reach the town of Eretria with its cool pubs, some of which are Polish. The hotel is recommended."
3997,"Thank you doctor, I think thanks to you I'll get out of the way and everything bad is already behind me and only good days ahead. You are a nice and warm person, a cure for the soul, you restore confidence in yourself and in the fact that it can only be better."
3998,"Generally I recommend the hotel to families with children. There are many amenities and attractions for the little ones. Even during the winter holidays, despite the bad weather, there is something to do. However, we have reservations about the cleanliness of the bathrooms (dirty shower hose, not holding the holder for the shower handset - although it is not related to cleanliness, the cabin also did not belong to the shiny). ...on the stairs of the building ""dust cats"". There is really a lot of food (the so-called Swedish table), despite the room full of guests, the food during meals was reported all the time. Unfortunately, I didn't really like the food, poorly seasoned, dried / hard fish etc. However, you could always find something for yourself and we never went out hungry. A great idea with pancakes fried by ourselves. A children's corner of play for the kids also on the plus side. Coffee, tea and drinks for free meals, which unfortunately does not apply in all hotels. The pool is a bit small for such a number of hotel guests plus people from outside. In the paddling pool the ground goes away, it is sometimes uneven, but the kids still had fun. To the sea not far away, climbing the cliff up the stairs. Personally, I would visit this place again because I have a nice memory of our stay, unfortunately my husband has more mixed feelings. The children should be very happy: ) It's worth seeing for yourself."
3999,"The hotel is nicely located with good food but here the good sides of the hotel end. Typical Greek savings and pulling money out of tourists at every turn. All inclusive is a joke - for drinks you have to pay extra - about 6 euros while they are diluted and disgusting . The vending machine with drinks switched off in the evening and you have to stand in line after 30 minutes for juice or alcohol . The bar ( mini ) is operated by two bartenders who spend everything with a lot to wish for. I will add that all inclusive works only up to 2300 . The bartender refused water to my child when we came back from a trip after 23 - and it was 2305 - which has 5 years to pay 1.5 euros for a tiny plastic cup of water. The child with the cry came back to me . He got angry and went to the bar by himself telling him with a slight exaggeration. He started screaming and waving the card printed on the printer almost hitting me in the face. The worse hotel and such mediocre staff hadn't seen 'em in a long time. The dirty hotel in general, the mini bathrooms and the hotel describes that there are attractions for children that do not exist because they are ruined or broken. The bus to the city or the beaches once will come once not. The rooms were supposed to be with a separate bedroom for the children and it turned out that we have an extra bed for one kid half a meter away from our child and the road sleeps a little further. I'll say honestly avoid this hotel and if you want to come, beware of big expenses, nervous situations with the crew and dirt. Your choice . Greetings to you. Oh, I forgot to add that for meals such as breakfast or dinner you also have to stand and wait . The crew closes the gates in front of your face and you wait for the tables to be released because the hotel has 165 rooms and the tables can be for field guests. Attached are pictures of queues for food or other hotel including pouring handles etc. Avoid! ! ! ! ! ! !"

The worst results were reported by luxury hotels in London, including The Dorchester, Grosvenor House and the Firmdale group, many of which charge £20 per 24-hour wireless access. Budget hotel chains such as the Holiday Inn also charge £15 in the UK and £20 in continental Europe for daily access. Many of the establishments mentioned at the beginning of Accor have a price of 3 GBP 85 per hour of Wi Fi. Less than 2% of the readers of ""The Telegraph Travel"" say that the charges at the hotel for W - Fi were ""fair"". and high charges are seen as speculative."
4001,"My visit to Dr Joanna Krygowska-Zielińska was a traumatic experience. After a quick and inaccurate interview because apparently your doctor was in a hurry somewhere - he examined me and made a wrong diagnosis! There was still something wrong ! After two days I went to another gynaecologist, who urgently referred me to Poznan for surgery! I don't wish anybody so much stress during the nights of sleep, waiting for the result for two weeks. I sincerely do NOT recommend it !"
4002,"I confirm that a very good doctor by vocation as a physician - makes accurate diagnoses, consults them with his colleagues doctors as he has doubts. An intelligent person. I agree with one of the descriptions, however, that quite unconventional - a lot of jokes in the office, a lot of comments, etc. and not everyone likes it."
4003,"The visit lasted 3 minutes. The doctor usually arrives late, so she receives everyone at an ""express rate"". She asked me what I was sick and immediately prescribed ointment and pills - this is the whole visit. The next visit was a bit better as the Doctor conducted a short interview.

Unfortunately the waiting time also left a lot to be desired. She no longer chose m ."

4005,"The hotel is situated almost on the lake itself, at the beginning of the lake. The hotel has a small swimming pool, even an indoor place to relax, a sauna, some equipment for exercise. There are no balconies in all the roomsThe object is clean and despite its age, the staff is polite. Breakfast is very good. It is difficult to park, there are some places, but quickly they are busy and that is the problem, you have to pay for parking in the city. This should be better solved."
4006,"""We're going against the trends,"" admits the acoustician. He explains that although many teams of researchers are working on new generations of stethoscopes around the world, most often the ideas are based on collecting the acoustic signals from the body as accurately as possible and throwing them into a computer which, instead of a doctor, would interpret these results and make a diagnosis. Meanwhile, according to Dr . Nowak's opinion is not the solution that doctors and patients are waiting for. According to acoustics, it is important that the stethoscope is still a simple, portable device which would help the doctor to make an initial diagnosis quickly. The Polish team has therefore focused on another aspect of the improvement of the stethoscope - to adapt the signal from the device to the physical capabilities of the human ear and to how sounds are perceived in the brain. The diagnosis and interpretation of the results would still depend on the doctor. And yet such a diagnosis results not only from acoustic signals from the body, but also from observation and conversation with the patient."
4007,"We came back from a very successful holiday in Gran Canaria (August 2013), but the hotel disappointed us a bit. Animations and hotel focused on tourists from the UK. The animations and the hotel are focused on tourists from the UK and Scandinavia, daytime and evening animations focused exclusively on them. For Poles in the evening no attractions, at 23 . 00 the life in the hotel was dying. Wi - Fi paid, so even the Internet is missing. A great advantage of the hotel and TUI were activities for children aged 4 - 12 years in the Polish-speaking Scan Holiday Club. It's just a pity that in the evening animations Polish children were left out, and the games were conducted solely for children from England, and on the second scene from Sweden and Norway. The hotel is located in a remote area, there is practically nothing interesting about it, to the nearest town was a few kilometers, so after dinner there were no more attractions. There is basically no beach at the hotel, there are only stones. On a piece of beach near the hotel, sun loungers for a fee and no bar all inclusive. The pools are average, with one small slide. The food is delicious, varied, a paradise for gloves. Poles located on the first and second floor, overlooking the canopy of the restaurant. The beautiful view of the ocean was said to have been on the upper floors, which were occupied by tourists from England and Scandinavia. The resident was very unpleasant and reluctant to answer questions. The island is beautiful and worth a visit! ! ! We rented a car and drove around the most interesting places - it is worth seeing such cities as Maspalomas and Puerto Rico, the beaches of Anfidelmare and Amadores (these are super holiday locations), and the Quayadeque Gorge with the natives' apartments in the rocks. Generally I recommend Gran Canaria, a hotel less. We were with children 8 and 17 years old."
4008,Minuses ( and there were many of them ) : - Unwashed blankets - Little space in the room - Rooms arranged in a claustrophobic way - Not enough showers for so many rooms - Terribly stuffy - Walls and doors through which you can hear everything and also in the corridor everything echoed - No elevator ( but it will still get away ) - Strict rulesPlusy ( and there were not many of them ) : + very close to the centre + lots of seats in the corridor + possibility to make yourself a coffee and/or tea
4010,"The doctor has changed her approach to the patient very much. After several successful visits in previous years, the last two were very dry, formal and unsympathetic. Very unpleasant, because I had hoped to be treated by the doctor involved. I wish the doctor more warmth and respect, especially for the older patient."
4011,"Course : French B 1 and B 1 - E bdb [ / b ] Very nice gentleman . He likes to make jokes in class, but he sticks to the timetable, there are not too many jokes :) He leads the lessons by speaking French. He makes sure that everyone speaks in class, but if someone can not do something - does not oppress, helps. There is no stress: ) Nice attitude towards the student, no problems. If you are doing well, you do not pay attention to absences. It is important that everything is counted. Colloquia - not too difficult (material from classes) . There are no cards (at all). I recommend it! !"
4012,"To avoid writing a story - if you have another option, do not choose this hotel! There is no car park, you leave your car in a public car park and unattended. I had the impression that there are a lot of dark people in this area and I did not feel safe there. The hotel itself is only for the benefit of the owner and the hotel guests get the least money they can get for their money. I do not recommend it!"
4013,"Location - park slightly neglected but charming . Meals - breakfast OK but you have to hurry up because after 09 15 does not supplement the bread service only bread in 3 types. Dinner on the first day of the revelation, very good. On the second day in the form of a buffet, a choice more choice but not the taste every day before. The dishes barely warmed up by the staff need to be reminded to add plates and cutlery. Visiting the castle 15 zł guide barely correct . Dark room, no fridge in the room, one chair in a double room."
4014,"The hotel is well located, a few steps away from the market square and Wawel Castle and the railway and bus station make it easy to explore Krakow. What the hotel's service is nice and helpful, the rooms are nice and neat and not expensive with the possibility of having breakfast which is really delicious and of course there is an open bar is 24 and so the same advantages."
4015,"I'm told the surgeon is a good surgeon, but I'll tell you about it when he finishes his treatment. The approach to people, however, is completely disrespectful (hands in pockets, mocking smiles). It is difficult to get information from him, he believes that : ""the patient does not need to know anything. . . "" ? ! ...and that's why I advise against it! ! !"
4016,"The interiors of the hotel are decorated in a good climate. You can get lost in the castle corridors but it only adds to the charm of your stay. Tasty food and nice service make your stay in a friendly atmosphere. What disappoints is the swimming pool (not too big) and sauna zone (rather small with leaky doors). The organization of staff work in the wellness zone is also poor. Due to the lack of a staff member at the reception desk of the zone, the notification that the sauna is not working (i.e. nobody turned on the heating) required a change of dressing gown from saunas to the main reception desk of the hotel."
4017,"[ color = yellow ] I'm positive too. . . . .colloquially quite spezial, a thousand versions of the test. . . . . . .but for the credit and professor is very nice and student friendly. . . . has great knowledge in his field and knows how to convey it - which is very important, interesting lectures and never boring - I recommend [ / b ] [ / color ]"
4018,"I was on my first visit and unfortunately I will not return, mainly because I expected more commitment, empathy, concrete. Ilona is very distant, she doesn't say much. Perhaps this is her method of working, so she does not give a negative assessment. She has heard a few pertinent observations, but in a very cool atmosphere. When she left the office, she didn't feel too well and she had the feeling that I wouldn't want to continue. Those who expect support, understanding and commitment from the therapist are advised against it. I suspect, however, that people who need space to talk, may be satisfied."
4019,"The resort is located 1 km from the beach, peace and quiet. But in the season it's a little bit of a bumpy and with all the equipment and kids it's not that easy. Food of medium quality, no menu for children's taste. Very cool animators. Cottages - mine was one with a tiny bathroom. But generally clean and tidy . I recommend it for those who do not require it."
4020,"Unfortunately, the doctor quickly and not very professionally (in my opinion) approached my problem. The ultrasound was performed quickly and not very carefully. He does not deal with kidney stones - as he said - but with oncology. The treatment I would do if my symptoms persisted he wrote on a piece of paper and recommended the hospital where it could be done at full cost. Maybe in case of serious oncological problems he is a good specialist but in other cases I do not recommend."
4021,"she spent one night at the hotel during a conference. Located 5 minutes walk from the shutters but in a quiet place, there was no noise at night. The rooms were clean, air-conditioned, tea and coffee set, TV. everything was fine, courteous reception. for one night with breakfast she paid m 110 pln. So the price was perfect for quality. Breakfast is very good, there's a children's corner in the restaurant."
4022,"I have been a patient of Mrs. Dr. for 4 years and I am very satisfied with my 2 pregnancies and never even mentioned the fee she did all the tests she was always nice sometimes she was in a bad mood as everyone is human after all. I don't understand how you can say about her that she is a bad doctor is that she makes herself pay for tests not reimbursed by the NFZ is normal it's not a foundation, when dentists pay for some services no one complains"
4023,"I highly recommend ! ! ! D He lectures perfectly, additionally he made sure that the drawings and patterns from the lectures are on the Internet and we only have to write down what he says ; ) Very good approach to life . . . is simply interesting, and this joyful atmosphere accompanying the speeches of Dr. Polak: D And the credit? Nothing simpler. . . . .the tasks from previous years are repeated on the wheel. . . : ) You can do it by studying for 15 minutes ( read : studying tasks from previous years ) ; )"
4024,"I sincerely recommend this hotel. Location by the ocean, beautiful. Underneath the hotel beach, sandy, clean and not crowded. The hotel itself super 4 . The rooms are nice, large, the bathrooms are clean (minor grout corrections can be seen but this is not a problem.) Food and service at 6! ! squids, shrimp in kilograms! ! ! choice incredibly large I sincerely recommend for a peaceful holiday, in the hotel alone Englishmen in the age of 70 to perhaps even 100 years. Silence, peace and relaxation. The English only eat pork and some onion soup, they do not touch the seafood so you can pack up to full, never missing anything! ! ! !"
4027,"Let's also remember how deep research is conducted by the guest before making a decision. Not to mention the statistics - it is a dozen or so websites of various hotels (but also OTA, metasearch, etc.) and a few to a dozen or so opinions about the object of interest. As we can see we have plenty of opportunities to win a guest for ourselves! - 2 - Reservation considered from the technical side of closing the transaction, because we assume that the decision was made in the first point. We have to point out here that the guest can still think about the obstacles in the reservation process. I will only mention some examples: not preparing the reception, paying attention to another offer using OTA or lack of preferred payment method in the reservation engine on the website. These obstacles may affect the change of the reservation channel (from less to more expensive) or lead to its complete abandonment."
4028,"I've been suffering from kidney stones for 10 years. In my case, the removal of kidney stones has so far been based on the ESWL method with different results. I was referred to doctor Rafał Olejnik by order of a doctor working in WCM in Opole. He assured that in the clinic where Dr Olejnik works he is the only one in the Opole region to use modern and, above all, effective methods of kidney stones treatment (he meant RIRS). Of course he was not wrong! The procedure itself ran quickly and efficiently without complications and subsequent complications. The waiting time is not long, which is a big advantage. Dr Rafał Olejnik is a real doctor by vocation. Full professionalism, kindness, efficiency, nice atmosphere, exemplary medical care, human approach to the patient are just some of the features describing this doctor. A great feeling is how with more physical effort or longer walk I do not feel any pain in my kidneys - which previously very often happened to me - and this is thanks to Dr. Rafał Olejnik for which I am very grateful to him. Like a urologist - only Dr. Rafał Olejnik I recommend!"
4029,"If someone is looking for a quiet place to rest, I definitely do NOT recommend it! ! ! Negatives: - crowds of people, causing the word ""corner"" to take on a different meaning, - organized tours, making life difficult for hotel guests from the very morning, - lack of a separate parking space for guests definitely disqualifies this place as an oasis of peace. It is worth visiting only as a stop on the way. The place has positives: - tasty breakfasts, - country farm with animals, - playground ""on the hay "" ."
4030,"Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to spend the night in this hostel, the staff promised us to move the night by one day, sold our previously booked places, and then informed us that we can not come, because there are no places, and earlier promised that there will be no problem with moving the night by one day. From my account, they charged the whole fee for the night for two people ."
4031,"High hopes are still placed in molecularly oriented therapies. As explained to PAP by prof . Grandpa, these drugs are now available worldwide for ok . 10-15 percent of patients with so-called non-small cell lung cancer (approximately 80 percent of lung cancer cases - PAP) . These are patients with the so-called EGFR gene activation mutation or with the so-called EML4 fusion gene - ALK . By administering molecularly targeted drugs, it is possible not only to extend their lives, but also to improve their quality. That is why pharmaceutical companies compete with each other in the development of new drugs which will work in case of other genetic changes, e.g. in the KRAS, HER2, ROS1 and many others . The results of research on many such drugs are presented in Geneva."
4032,"In February, she was treated by the doctor to fill her mouth with hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid treatment moisturized the lips, improved lip contour and facial profile. You do not need to prepare yourself for the treatment. Lip augmentation was performed under local anesthesia - with the use of an anesthetic cream. The procedure lasted a dozen or so minutes and ran quite pleasantly and gently. The doctor showed great patience and forbearance with regard to questions asked by me and gave a comprehensive answer to each question. The procedure was divided into two stages for adaptation reasons because I was afraid of the exaggerated effect and preferred to introduce such an exchange gradually. The results after the treatment are immediate, it is worth knowing not to make an appointment in the middle of the week because shortly after the application of the substance, swelling or bruises may appear as in my case, about which I was informed by the doctor. On the second day there was no trace of them and the swelling went down after two days. However, I must admit that the swelling appears only after the first treatment, and with the next application of hyaluronic acid there is no longer any place at all. I can easily recommend to the doctor the effect of my treatment is perfect, the lips are natural, moisturized, fuller but not exaggerated! ! ! I recommend I recommend the right person in the right place."
4033,"Thank you, doctor, for curing me of bruxism. For 10 years he has been eating my teeth regularly and every dentist has been giving me a relaxation splint, which actually worked moderately and was cumbersome to use. Dr. Opiłka offered me to loosen the rumen with botox on my first visit and then, after the tension subsided, slowly rebuilt my teeth using porcelain inlays and harder fillings. The sensation after botox is great. I wake up in the morning and I don't have a jaw ache, my headaches have subsided and my face has become more drawn. I realize that botox has to be repeated again to three times but it is better than eating my teeth and notoriously rebuilding them."
4034,"""Our research has also shown that in women with this mutation the risk of death depends to a large extent on the size of the tumour - adds the Szczecin geneticist. - If it is detected quite early, when it does not exceed 2 cm in diameter, the probability of ten-year survival reaches 82%. Only when the tumour is larger than 2 cm in size, it drops to only 30%. ""According to the specialist, in carriers of PALB2 mutations, it is essential to regularly undergo screening such as mammography and ultrasound and possibly MRI. ""These diagnostic tests allow early detection of breast cancer when it is still small. This has been confirmed by our research, we have had patients with this mutation tested and were able to detect tumours as small as 8 mm, 10 mm, 11 mm or 16 mm. - emphasizes ."
4035,"Unfortunately, the doctor also failed to meet my expectations. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, about which she knew nothing, and after the visit she did not know more. Indeed, an extremely reticent doctor, no information on how to deal with the ailments. I cannot assess the competence of the doctor, he issues prescriptions, does ultrasounds (without a word), I (the patient) am alive, so the treatment itself is probably quite right, although I am really not sure if it is the best possible."

4038,The location of the hotel is excellent by the sea in a complex of hotels with aqapark. Rooms stinking with worms and not cleaned throughout the stay . The hotel staff lives like in another world without any interest in hotel guests at all. Cool monotonous food with a small selection of dishes . You can go back there but to another hotel in this complex where the atmosphere is completely different . this hotel is not recommended .
4039,"I went to her by order of my friends at the hospital clinic. Indeed, all the tests she ordered, were done free of charge at the hospital (including ultrasound) and it did not take long to wait for the deadline. She stopped going to her, and with me 2 of the colleagues who recommended her, after each of them found diabetes, elevated prolactin levels, PCO and had her go on a diet. Of course, each of us had different test results (they compared us) and different symptoms. Private phone calls during the patient's visit are normal. She is nice, but she doesn't listen to her patients and is always in a hurry or disappears and waits for her under the office. I advise against it!"
4040,"I advise against it, arrogant, rude doctor, I was with this Lord only once and I will not show up again. I am in the 8th week of pregnancy. I waited for the visit for more than 2 hours because the doctor's doctor in the meantime disappeared for half an hour, explaining that he must go to the ward. After the entrance to the office almost froze, it was there maybe with 15 degrees, the air conditioning turned on at the maximum because the doctor said that such a temperature is pleasant. At the visit the doctor asked to take off his clothes, then he took a vaginal smear, he was very fragile, he pressed on his stomach with great force despite the fact that she had previously mentioned to him the pains in his abdomen and ovaries. Then he printed out a card with the list of tests to do and told me to come with the results in a month. 2 weeks earlier I had an ultrasound done privately, as a result I was recommended to do it again in 2 weeks' time (visit to Dr. Kanonowicz), because there was no echo of the embryo at 1, so at the end of the visit I asked the doctor if we are going to do an ultrasound, because I was recommended to do it, because there was no echo of the embryo at the previous one, the doctor said to go and check it privately, then I will find out, because he has been doing only ultrasound for 11 weeks. She left the office with tears in her eyes, I do not recommend this doctor!"
4041,"The hotel was 'em last year - the exterior of the castle makes a fantastic impression, especially the garden, although at times it also seems to be neglected. Unfortunately, the rooms are of very low quality, the quality of the finishes rather low. Nothing is impressive. However, the worst is the swimming pool - in the advertising pictures it is huge, in fact it accommodates several people."
4042,"The apartment that we received was not the one that we booked, so there were not enough beds and bedding for our group; very reluctant to help the staff, who had no idea what they were doing (and did not call back), the place needed a decent cleaning, sheets of ""Egyptian cotton"" were old and dirty, but very good location. Definitely visit Cracow, maybe just stop somewhere else!"
4043,"We stayed in room 31, although it is hard to call it a double room. The size of the room is a shock. Beds are mattresses spread out on the ground. I have no objection to the cleanliness. But to customer service yes . 3 times was reported at the reception desk the fact that you can not connect to the Internet. During my stay I could not use the Internet. I survived 'em and I have done well but the quality of customer service leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to solving a very simple problem. Breakfast is ok but is worth 8 . 90 e ? Back to the size of the room - the room is so small that the table is standing right next to the front door, which in case of fire regulations is not quite allowed. . ."
4044,"The building is very large, clean rooms - nice cleaning ladies, beautiful garden in the whole complex, animation team very committed, food: breakfast on 3 +, dinner on 4 (vegetarians and vegans will find something for themselves). Waiters are often nervous, although I am not surprised. The reception desk - some people do not even get up from the chair as the hotel guest approaches. no contact with the hotel manager (she asked m 2 times). In July, during a 2-week stay, 4 weddings were held, which strongly disturbed the hotel guests' stay. Every evening in the lobby you played and pretended to be able to sing the same thing every day. Unbearable! Somehow all inclusive on level 2 . After an hour . 14 . 00 there is no possibility to have lunch, there are bad sandwiches, toasts etc . It's hard to find a place by the pools - ""people, despite the ban, book"" sunbeds from the very morning - no reaction from the hotel, which is unacceptable. A hotel in a total seclusion, without a car you can't do without it. After the rain the cesspool overflowed, the smell was unbearable, and the old man from the reception desk pretended that nothing happened. Hot water in the swimming pools, at lunchtime, peace and quiet. Once there was no water in the toilets by the restaurant - I don't have to tell you what happened there. Well, it happens. Showers by the indoor pool dirty. Hotel roof neglected - when I think something happened there, it's closed now. Scandalous wifi prices, the reception desk works very poorly. In the second week, every day we had to go to the recuperation ""magnetize"" card because it did not work. The rooms with sea view are above the restaurant - loud. There are also rooms very low - dark. In general, the price for the hotel does not entail quality. It is a pity."
4045,"Three missed diagnoses in a child and two missed diagnoses in an adult. The child was at risk of severe hearing loss. The doctor has problems with concentration (something unrelated to the question is answered). Lack of delicacy in the case of examination of a child - total lack of approach to a small patient, the doctor believes that the child is an adult and expects from him/her 100% cooperation, if the child does not cooperate because the examination is painful becomes unpleasant for the child. Medieval methods of hearing test (he stands at one end of the room, the child at the other and has to ""listen"" to what the doctor says - embarrassing when other sounds get out of the hallway - inaccurate test). Lack of equipment and hygiene - before the examination in the mouth and nose he does not wash his hands, does not have gloves (let's think that e.g. before we examined a person with staphylocococcus in the oral cavity). Unfortunately, the only children's laryngologist in the housing estate within the NFZ ."
4047,"The doctor is factual, she answers every question specifically, not in general terms, which is very important. I also liked her sincere opinion and approach to the examination, especially to the vastness of examinations (often unnecessary) commissioned by private gynaecologists. I myself was a patient of a private clinic in my previous place of residence and I know how the number of examinations looked like (which of course involves costs and not little unfortunately). It was all explained to me, I received answers to questions, the examination went quickly, a concrete conversation. The only thing I missed was maybe a bigger smile or sympathy for the patient."
4048,"I am very pleased with the procedure performed by Dr. Piotr Fleszar . An excellent specialist in the field of aesthetic medicine, very competent, eloquent, experienced, willing to help, smiling, understanding and could be exchanged and exchanged. I am very positively surprised by the results of the Dermapen treatment which proved to be a great solution for my acne scars. He asked me for help for a doctor because she heard the same positive things about him. In practice he did not disappoint me. He comes to his patient very individually, he takes care of safety, comfort and cleanliness in the office, he never deals with any personal matters. He showed me how focused and committed he is. I was very impressed by his professionalism and seriousness. The treatment was completely painless and overall I enjoyed the results she could see from him. Acne scars are no longer my nightmare and do not affect my appearance. I am very pleased that she asked me to this very office and this very doctor. She had to wait for almost 2 weeks, but it was really worth it. The doctor is meticulous, precise and very determined in his treatments. You can see that he knows things and aesthetic medicine is no stranger to him. I am extremely happy with the results of the treatment and I have to admit that thanks to him she has gained me again confidence. Thank you for your kindness and I wish you success, Doctor!"
4050,"He was 'em on a private visit to LUX - MEDA. Despite the fact that he paid 'em 140 zloty for the visit, it looked like an ordinary visit to the state doctor where I felt bad about the fact that I disturbed the doctor in drinking coffee. She didn't want to listen to my medical history at all, because 'what used to be no matter - it's important if it hurts now'. She couldn't tell where my illness could come from and, what's worse, she couldn't tell if it would pass. For some of my additional questions she answered 'I don't know' or 'it's hard to say'. It's a pity that in a few minutes of dubious quality advice, I had to pay that much. I ended up saving me ear drops that you can buy over the counter and Nurofen, the simplest painkiller. In general, I do not recommend it."
4052,"The stink from the hotel septic tank! ! ! It kept us awake. It woke up from a deep sleep. Beware of this hotel. The local car rental workers judge him to be the worst in this area of the island. The surprise is the paid air conditioning since September 1, despite over 30 degrees of heat. Bathrooms in poor condition . Dirty and uncleaned . In every corner of the ford from the beginning of the season ."
4053,"Comparing to other pedigrees from the Medicover of Lodz, definitely above average. Nice, great contact with children, seen with the paediatric experience, it's only a pity that he always prescribes the same drugs, although on the other hand they help us, only that they are probably the most expensive of the whole pharmacy."
4055,"In his opinion, it is very difficult to enter the medical equipment market with new devices. A lot of equipment, which does not break down, is owned by doctors. Nevertheless, his company managed to commercialize laser devices for dermatological applications. Lasers and their control systems, which are built by Cutera company listed on NASDAQ, are sold all over the world, also in Poland. In Europe there are numerous service and sales offices, most of the equipment is sold in the USA and Asia, mainly in Japan and Korea. Orkiszewski has been entered in the Golden Book of Warsaw University of Technology Graduates. The ceremony took place on 16 November. The honored graduate in an interview with PAP confirmed his readiness to support the mentoring project, i.e. to support the most talented students by people experienced in combining scientific achievements, applied research and business."
4056,"Prof . Kuśmierczyk hopes that the number of heart transplants in IK will continue to grow. A new type of transplantation is also planned. ""We are already prepared for the simultaneous transplantation of the heart and kidney, and in the future the heart and liver, the lung itself and the heart and lungs"" - he added . ""Transplantation is still the most effective method of treating extreme heart failure,"" - emphasized prof . Kuśmierczyk . The demand for these treatments will increase. There are more and more patients requiring urgent transplants . In 2015 out of 42 transplants as many as 30 were urgent . The main part of patients undergoing surgery are patients of 50 each. However, young people, 20- and 30-year-olds and even people under 20 years of age also require heart transplants."
4057,"Upon arrival, we had to call the owner because there was only a bell at the indicated address. After a while the nice gentleman took us to a different place than in the offer ! We received 6 keys and we had a problem to get through 3 gates separating the apartment from the city. It turned out that we received a dark apartment from the courtyard, without air conditioning. The breakfast we paid for turned out to be the remains of the previous tenants, i.e. open bread, cookies, etc. I do not recommend this ""guesthouse""! ! !"
4058,"A fabulous place for the whole family. Clean and tidy . Excellent service . You can really relax in peace and quiet in the hotel itself using just a swimming pool or a spa and if you feel like a little walk you can go for a walk in the surrounding area. Nice alleys for walks, nice attractions for children such as rope park, a small zoo connected to the fairy tale land, Mongolian village or swimming and fishing. You don't have to go anywhere else to relax actively. We've been out for a total of 9 days and fixing was what to do during that time. You can also go to the sea because it is not far away. A big disadvantage is the so-called "" children's playroom "" . The weather was good for us, so we were with our daughter to see this room just out of curiosity. Unfortunately this is a failure, an ordinary conference room with several mini tables for children, some spicy toys, some crayons and a sleepy animator. This attraction point needs to be changed. The rest is in the best order. Decent food, some food from other areas (nicely described) every day. We really did spend our holiday with one attraction on arrival. Namely, I was mistaken for a reservation date and we were there a day sooner, what's worse, there was no free room; (But also, the lady from the reception found quick advice on this. She called another hotel and booked us a room and explained how to get there. So we were in two hotels in one trip. It was really nice, I recommend to everyone such a bumper: P Greetings"
4059,"There's nothing to get attached to. . . Well, maybe the bathroom could be more beautiful and all, but it's just a power struggle. . I have a nice memory of being with my beloved. Eating okay! Location, um... . We were just so lucky. To the taxi market about 20 minutes. Nice lobby and big parking lot."
4060,"The week's stay was generally successful, but we will not return to this hotel. . . (successful, because the vast majority of the time we spent outside its walls, coming back for the night). Pluses: - very good staff in the wellness section - super massages - clean roomsMinus: - hotel focused on the seasonal service of a mass of guests (organized groups) - individual guest does not feel exceptional, taken care of, encouraged to take advantage of the services offered by the hotel - as a base for excursions in the Pieniny Mountains a little bit far away - that is why the hotel can only be recommended to the motorists, and it is best to look for accommodation closer to Szczawnica - rooms with the climate of the People's Republic of Poland - lack of use of the potential of the infrastructure in the area and surrounding area of the hotel, e.g. the hotel. It is a pity that the hotel, despite a small number of guests, did not organize even a bonfire (the lack of care for the guest is most probably due to the lack of employees - savings? ? ) - no hotel infrastructure is available at times convenient for the guest (on rainy days the swimming pool is open from 14 : 00, fitness room from 16 : 00 ! - due to active wellness from this hour) - The swimming pool is also accessible to visitors from outside, so a lot of groups of children etc. - No possibility of peaceful enjoymentSuppreciation - you certainly won't get hungry, but serving ice-cold apple pie for dessert (almost daily) is not a good idea."
4061,"Good location in the city centre, close to the Silesian Museum, paid parking. Professional service at the reception desk during check-in, worse dealing with guests' requests for stay. As a result, there is no response to repeated requests for changing towels at a different time than that provided in advance. Smoking is completely forbidden in the hotel. In the room you received you could smell like from an ashtray. Opening the window, which can only be opened, did not improve the situation. The source of the smell was the air conditioning, which at that moment became useless. The room could not be changed because of the alleged total occupancy. Cleaning the room leaves much to be desired. In total, it is not known whether the facility wants to be a hotel or a hostel. The promotional offer at an attractive price and the recently introduced paid options for changing bed linen, towels and other accessories would indicate the latter. I wouldn't recommend it, unless it's at a very attractive price. It's the only thing that speaks to reason, maybe even speaks to mine."
4062,"However, cancer treatment assistance is not the only area where oxygen maps can be used. ""One such ailment is also night apnea, or snoring, which can lead to severe hypoxia not only of the brain but of the whole body and accelerates the development of cancer,"" explained the researcher. They can be used in the treatment of: the effects of stroke, limb hypoxia, vascular damage such as diabetes, difficult to heal wounds. For the time being, the researchers cannot imaging the whole body of the patient, but only its individual parts. The obstacle here is underdeveloped technology and the lack of equipment allowing for imaging cancers in the whole body. However, as the researcher assured us, progress in this field is very high and in a few years time such equipment should be available."
4063,"Room just right for two people, warm, clean, reasonably quiet / depends on whether you have a room by the elevator where other guests pass or away and whether the air conditioner fan in the room is greased or shows off at night / . The pillow could be thicker or two such pillows would be perfect. Besides, it would be perfect. Restaurant and bar on site at the hotel ."
4065,"Not only did we get the dirty apartments at the start, but the sauna is also blowing a mushroom so that even the hardcore amount of chlorine does not help. And the apartments themselves were more like cages than apartments. They should all be smaller by at least 2 people because they can't be moved. The service is terrible, we'll never go back there."
4066,"Hello, 7 months ago I had the privilege of meeting Dr. . However, before I met her, I had visited 2 outpatient clinics in Germany, exactly in Hannover, and I was offered to remove 3 teeth including one. (advanced periodontosis, untreated teeth) there were no longer any short-term solutions. The extraction seemed to be unavoidable even because of the fact that the dentists mentioned earlier were in agreement, so I was surprised when the doctor tried to save my dentition. After the first visits, I was surprised by the professionalism and professionalism, but at the same time it made me realize that I can trust both the doctor and the staff who competently coordinate the entire logistics of the office, setting the hours of visits to the needs and capabilities of the patient, confirming and reminding by phone the day before the visit, which is important for a patient leading an intensive professional lifestyle. I can assure you that my teeth were saved, even though the treatment was not finished, thanks to the treatments and prevention that I was recommended. ( Mrs. Dr . found the time to do so ) to make me realize that the effectiveness of the treatment does not depend only on her. Those of you who have had the opportunity to be in dental practices in Germany, Holland or Belgium are sure to find out that this practice represents not only Poland but also Europe with dignity. However, the treatment is professional, effective, painless, and it is thanks to this that the doctor performs his profession with passion and vocation, he has an innate talent for it. That is why I can also recommend the Awansdent Clinic to everyone with a clear conscience, even in situations that would seem hopeless. In case of doubt I can give you my email Greetings to Bogdan"
4068,"Hotel Pod Swierkiem is located near the spa park. It is a family hotel with original design. Rooms are spacious, clean, equipped with TV-sat, free wireless internet access and wifi. The restaurant serves delicious meals at affordable prices. Photos on the walls of the restaurant show that people from the business and cultural world are regular visitors. Nice and helpful service. The only drawback is that the parking lot is too small. I recommend it."
4069,"The antibodies used so far in immunotherapy combine with proteins located on the surface of T lymphocytes, thus activating them to fight cancer cells. It can be said that they unblock the immune system. Meanwhile, the Polish-Swiss team is looking for peptide compounds that will act on the immune system similarly to the antibodies. ""For comparison: antibodies consist e.g. of 3 thousand bricks - amino acids and peptides - only 20 - 30 bricks"" - points out prof . Rodziewicz - Motovidło . He adds that while peptide can be synthesized by scientists in the laboratory, the antibodies are most often produced in animal organisms such as mice or rabbits or in tissue cultures."
4070,"A hotel of good quality. Maybe it doesn't deserve 5 stars but a strong 4 . Very extensive hotel area. Unfortunately, located on the hills so you have to overlap. . . . .from above. . . . . . .uphill. . . Beautiful panoramic view. Unfortunately, no beach. . . Elevators only in the main building and to the platforms over maybe. . . A very large building. . . . . . . .so there's a lot of tourists too. In August. . . . .even a massacre. . . Very many children: small, bigger. I personally with such toddlers would not go there. . . . . .because you have to really get a lot of overlap. Bodrum itself is a place of rest for Turks from all over Turkey. The city is very congested. I recommend the Polish tourist office KLS Voyages Mrs. Dorota of Bodrum . Cheapest tours, checked . Prices are half as cheap as those of residents . As for the hotel itself, they keep it reasonably clean. With so many tourists and children . . . . . .I think the Hilton would have fallen. You have to remember that during the season. The food is very good. . . . . . .breakfasts a bit monotonous, but lunches and dinners. . . . . . Great. And it's cool. Nice slides. I don't recommend it to stiff tourists, though. A place to play and for big and small. . . . hehehehehe. Generally recommended for people with children but a little bit older. Nice place."
4071,"I do not recommend this place, in any way. An old-fashioned hotel with carpet on the ceiling. Terrible food, including service. The lady at the reception desk is unpleasant and uncooperative. Rooms with disabled standard are not suitable for use by able-bodied people. We are talking about a bathtub where it was not possible to take a standing bath or shower. Water does not go down after one bath. The whole hotel smells badly of food prepared in the kitchen."
4072,"The doctor's clinic was visited after a badly performed laser procedure of the lower frenulum, which resulted in the loss of the gums of the lower ones. The surgeon from Zamość, who ineptly performed the surgery, did not see the possibility of reconstruction and did not take any actions that could reduce the recession of the gums to which she contributed. Dr. Kuroczko undertook the procedure of gingiva transplantation, which was very well received and as a result the lower calf gums were rebuilt. Based on my own experience, I can certainly recommend you and give you the highest marks, not only for your great professionalism and reliability, but also for your friendly and empathic approach to the patient."
4073,"Or maybe it would interfere with the metabolism of the helicopters and in particular block the mechanism of folic acid metabolism necessary for their growth? This possibility is tested by Dr Joanna Panecka from the Center for New Technologies at the University of Warsaw, in cooperation with the University of Heidelberg and the Institute of Theoretical Research in Heidelberg. As the researcher explains, depending on the species, the dr Paneckas cause acute, often fatal infections such as: African coma, leishmaniosis, or chronic diseases such as Chagas' disease. The symptoms vary from hyperactivity, fever, lymph node enlargement to mental disorders and serious damage to internal organs. Leishmaniosis is called white leprosy because of the similarity of skin symptoms to leprosy, and chronic Chagas' disease causes damage to the heart and digestive tract."
4074,"I have to say that my stay in Eyre Place was one of the best I had in Edinburgh. The room with the bathroom was small, but since most of the time we were visiting, a good bed for the night was the main purpose. That said, we had a TV, radio and a small electric kettle if you wanted a hot drink. Another reviewer criticized the standard of cleanliness but I can't agree with that. The room was cleaned daily with a change of both bedding and towels. Breakfast was served in the Ardenlee, a few doors away, which was a bit tedious but rewarded by the quality and quantity of the food. The staff were helpful and friendly, especially Tracy, an Austrian woman who made everyone feel at home. My only criticism is the long time it takes to heat up the water in the shower - you can have a cup of tea while waiting. However, for such a price it was far above average and its location, just ten to fifteen minutes walk or a short bus ride from Prince Street. This is a great place to stay if you ever go to Edinburgh."
4076,"I completely agree with my colleague. I'll just add that for attending the lecture on St. Nicholas' Day he raised his grade by half a degree. and if it comes to getting a pass, he gave us about 40 questions and then he chose 8 and gave them on the wheel. : D : D"
4077,"I recommend avoiding the restaurant ! It's been a long time since you've seen 'em so frustrated. I thought the customers were disturbing them. He ordered 'em a lunch set: fish soup, roast chicken and dessert. Soup is OK ( nothing great ) but to not be able to bake a chicken you have to have ""talent"" - unfortunately it was not virulent. Of course, the prices are appropriate to the place, but absolutely not to the quality of the food. There are many other restaurants so there is plenty to choose from."
4079,"This misunderstanding is due to the fact that a flu vaccine does not protect against so-called flu-like infections, with which we often confuse it. ""These infections are hard to tell the difference. Influenza-like infections are most often caused by RSVs"" - says Prof . Brydak . It is the most common pathogen causing upper respiratory tract infections, mainly in children. It is generally mild in adolescents and adults, but may be dangerous for the elderly. Prof. Brydak . Adam Antczak recommends that people over 65 years of age and small children under 2 years of age should be vaccinated (the preparation can be administered to toddlers over 6 months of age). Also people suffering from chronic diseases: heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, blood diseases and diabetes, as well as those with weakened immune system. These people account for almost 90% of all influenza-related deaths. People over 50 are also slightly more at risk. ."
4080,"She was on her first visit for the time being. The doctor described her diagnosis in a very factual way. She honestly warned that dermatology is a treatment of symptoms, not causes. That's why she recommended me to do further research in search of the causes of the disease. I am positively oriented towards the treatment recommended by Dr. Brajczewska. I am waiting for the results of medicines and further steps."
4081,"The doctor made a very positive impression on me. Interested in the problem pacita . Very nice and gentle . Maybe a bit condescending, but I guess that's even better? It is difficult for me to talk about the end result, but at the moment I can say that I feel that the treatment is going in the right direction."
4082,"It's not Hit to SHIT. Dirty Loud, at the reception desk trying to combine with the price! ! ! By phone - 350 PLN for a small squalid room. After negotiations 250 but as it turned out after arrival without breakfast. TO AVOID FROM AFAR"
4083,"I was treated by Dr. Kościałkowski with 3 bowls, yes he gave a diagnosis, but it was wrong, he said that I have a discopathy, and this is just ordinary spinal cord inflammation. In addition, he gave me 34 treatments, which did not give anything because you can not work hard with this disease. The doctor likes to give out exemptions, and standing in front of his office you can meet people who are treated with him even for 2 years. He did not refer me, neither to the hospital nor to the MRI, his visits last from 5 to 7 minutes and the first question is: ""How do you feel?"" I recently had an appointment to extend my discharge, and the doctor didn't come to me without informing his patients. With nervousness changed em neurologist who saw me in the doorway and gave me a diagnosis and sent me for an MRI. So it's not worth treating him because it's just a waste of time."
4084,"After reading the review I was angry with my husband that he chose this hotel, but fortunately the hotel surprised me pleasantly. She was in a four-bed room, he was big, we never got so big. The rooms were cleaned daily and were clean. There were no cockroaches, but just in case I was clogging up the bathtub with a plug and the sink because of the reviews I read. A big plus for the cork in the bathtub: ) She had m hb, the meals were tasty. There was a breakfast in English style, but not only. More or less every day the same, eggs, cold cuts, cheese, toast, etc.. Dinners were b. varied, every day something different, there was always a fish and a few dishes to choose from, there were also dishes typically Maltese like rabbit, some dishes were put on by the waiter. There were quite a few fruits, maybe because of the season, in total there were only oranges. There were cakes every day, for sweet lovers. There were also seafood. The staff is nice. Not far from the hotel is the carrefour (trolees), the motoring museum, the bus terminal. B.close, as if you were leaving the hotel on the street where there is the Museum of Cars, only on the opposite side there is a small grocery store with good low prices (some prices lower than in carref.), a fruit wheel. The location is great, not far from the sea, quite close by bus you can get to the village of Popeye (I recommend!!!) and to the ferry to Gozo Island. Nearby is also delicious and cheap sphinx pastizzeria (I recommend with peas). In the hotel you can rent an iron with ironing board, remote control for TV (5 euro deposit, but you can turn on TV without it), kettle (3, 5E per day), pool towels (6E / day, including 3 returns). There is a refrigerator, dryer and glasses in the room. The indoor swimming pool is renovated and looks much better, there is also a sauna and jazz musicians next to it. The hotel is good as for such a price, it is cheap compared to others. I am b. satisfied with my stay in this facility."
4085,"Very nice doctor. . . .but so what? She didn't help me, she didn't refer me immediately to a surgeon who could help. Two unnecessary visits, lost time, and thus lost a nail too. In addition, she speaks in an extremely indecisive way. It is worth mentioning that the total cost of treatment of a nail infection thanks to the doctor was 1600 PLN, of which about 400 for her poor consultations and medicines. 700 is already a surgeon, prescribed by him drugs and dressings . 500 PLN loss of part of the salary for a week's absence from work . He was em unpleasant, but at least concrete ."
4086,"As he explained, if he was presently in this zone for a year, he would receive a dose of several millisieverts, i.e. exceeding the international standard for non-exposed persons, which is 1 millisieverts per year, but less than the dose envisaged for professionally exposed persons, i.e. 20 millisieverts per year. ""This is also well below the 100 millisieverts limit, which is considered to be the limit of the dose at which the risk of lesions occurs,"" added the Eye, noting that this limit applies to a single dose. As he explained, receiving e.g. for five years a dose of 20 millisieverts per year is not equivalent to receiving 100 millisieverts at a time. ""It is much safer to receive a given dose in the long term,"" he stressed."
4087,"Generally, the straightener is well made, a decent material and does not burn in your fingers when straightening. Unfortunately, its price and possibilities make me think of it so low. It recharges for a very long time, two straightenings (my hair is short) and the battery is discharged, the maximum temperature is very low, it is said to be able to cope with curly hair. It does not work. Comparing with an ordinary straightener, the maximum temperature is about 150 degrees Celsius. But I have a feeling that it can be less. So it's hard to straighten stubborn hair with it."
4088,"A nightmare ! . . . I'll remember this visit for a long time. . . I fell 'em down the stairs at work, my leg immediately swollen massacred, so I went to the orthopedist only the next day with swelling all over my foot. I hit 'em on him. . . He could barely get 'em to the office. . . The X-rays he evaluated: ""In these pictures it's not much to see. . . . .but I don't think it's broken,"" and then he had the brace bought and went back to work. He didn't even ask if I accidentally stick a shovel in the ground at work with this leg, he didn't ask for dismissal - nothing! . . . . .so he returned 'em to work. . . The next day, friendly colleagues unanimously decided to take me to another orthopedist who grabbed my head that I didn't get fired with such limited mobility, applied a series of anticoagulant injections and cyclic control until I was cured. The treatment lasted for a long time, but I didn't come back to Moczkowski and I won't recommend him to anyone. . . ."
4089,"This is a hostel where everything works. Where every question will be answered. With enthusiastic and committed people, even in the middle of the night friendly and smiling. And the decoration simply knocks. Few hostels have seen me so colorful, joyful variety. At the same time, everything fits together. She was here and partying and touristic. The rooms are clean and spacious. Beds and mattresses are one of the most comfortable on which she slept m . Each one is accompanied by a small lamp and a few pockets so that you can have the trinkets at hand. The noise from the street is not a problem. Bathrooms are clean and comfortable. The common room is very large and you can start a party, play or watch a match on the projector. They also have a few bicycles for rent also you do not have to look anywhere far. Although the hostel is quite large because it occupies two floors, it has one disadvantage lately: lately it is often completely occupied and you have to book your accommodation sometimes well in advance. But still in Poznan is like the best hostel for me. If only they have space, I sleep with them."
4090,"Air-conditioning only in advertising, they don't really turn on because it's probably a waste of money. The service is terrible, the waiters do a favor by serving the table. Waiting for food very long and at the end we get cold. . . . .something wrong. Even for cold drinks one waits endlessly. The chef and the waiters should undergo training. The food is terrible and tasteless."
4092,"Modern and well-kept rooms. But the service is terrible. From the beginning of the stay reported to em problems with the heating not working properly . Every time the reception informed me that the heating is restarting and should be fine. Unfortunately, after a while, the temperature on the panel automatically changed to a much lower temperature and cooled down the previously heated room. At the end of the stay, during the next notification, the lady ""talked"" that the temperature is imposed in advance by the hotel staff and as a guest I did not do anything to make it different. The lady informed me that I only have to lodge a complaint. Why then in such a case the rooms are fitted with panels from air conditioning / heating when with the stinginess and economy of the Hotel the temperature is automatically lowered? And the attitude of the staff as if they were working for a punishment. . . Dear guest, pay and don't report anything because we don't listen to you anyway because we are saving you! I do not recommend it."
4093,"Dr. Szuber is an excellent doctor for me and my partner. We have come to him as a specialist in fetal malformations, he works in the Laboratory of Fetal Diagnostics and Treatment in GPSK at Polna Street. I am writing from the perspective of a woman whose pregnancy is one of the tragic experiences, our son has a lethal defect of the nervous system, which he diagnosed immediately, first at his office, then at Polna Street. . . Apart from competence, knowledge (which is constantly eagerly expanded - this is how it was in our case, the doctor reached out to many sources before talking to us about what to do next) and skills, the doctor is really characterized by great kindness, great understanding and patience. . ... I did not even expect that the doctor could be so human, he talked to me in the hospital like a friend, he was looking for ways to help me, he offered to meet with a psychologist, he wrote down the documents needed to do the prenatal tests, although the patient should take care of it, he offered to contact the genetic clinic. He expressed his willingness to help also after the hospitalisation, repeatedly asked if he could still help, but he did not come to private appointments, he would gladly talk to you also on hospital duty. He took care of my discharge and all the formalities related to its receipt. In such a dramatic moment as the news of the slow dying of his own unborn child, such a doctor is a miracle. I recommend it with a calm conscience and I know that my next pregnancy will be led by Dr. Szuber, and I hope that everything will be calm and healthy. . . hello."
4094,"The Management Board of the Qubus Hotel chain, which has been actively developing in Poland since 1996, decided on a new strategy for building a competitive advantage for the years 2015-2020. Its basic assumption is, on the one hand, concentration of activities on Qubus Hotel facilities with high break-even point and, on the other hand, intensive development of a new brand - ALTO, whose first hotel was opened in February in ¯ory. At the same time one of the first decisions made in accordance with the new strategy is the withdrawal of the chain from the Wałbrzych market at the end of March 2015."
4096,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with that vacuum cleaner. Henry HVR 200 used em in England for many years. When em came to Poland he bought em Henry HVR 160 . It was a bit thinner and the seller assured that there was no difference between them, because the engines themselves, the execution, the accessories. but there is a difference. The tank is so small that I have to replace it more often. Although it comes with the same 9 litre bag, but when it's full a little more than 1 / 3 I have to change the bag. Then I read 'em in the technical data - the size of the tank is 6 liters and in practice half as much. The new product hvr 160 for the naive - clou is such that I change the bags more often. and I miss the good model HVR 200, where I changed the bag 1 x 3 m - ce ! ! ! !"
4097,"Very nice and nice person ! A student can't get hurt! It is very hard not to take a course with her. You walk so long as you get it right! : ) There is no need to sign up here, if you have the opportunity, then sign up to Mrs. Hajdusian! : )"
4098,"The lens bought 'em over a year ago, failure-free operation despite the harsh conditions of use: dust and moisture. There were also two falls of the lens itself without the camera. The picture is sharp but only at medium focal length and good light. Autofocus works properly and for static pictures fast enough. Lightweight construction made of weak materials . Cheap to purchase, which makes it an interesting alternative to lenses of renowned manufacturers . I recommend it for beginner amateurs and for work that does not require super quality images (I use it for documenting and reporting on the progress of construction work)."
4099,"Hello, my cora has been wearing the camera for years and the improvement is going poorly. Except that she wore the braces as a child so the bite is simple, only that the toys are not laid out. The treatment itself takes a very long time, the doctor has a different opinion on the treatment on each visit and when we were on our first visit I was delighted - I heard about the course of wearing the braces so as not to tear out the tricks because the palate will expand, then with a special mask to wear and now I do not know the treatment process and there is nothing of the things that were mentioned before. We're going to consult another orthodontist and I'm thinking about changing the office for my daughter. I would definitely not recommend it!"
4100,"I also recommend. It's very cool, just go to the board (tasks from the list) and he already likes you, very positive guy, he even gave us a cell number that if we have a problem with the task, we have to call. Once he even solved an incomprehensible task at home, he scanned and emailed us. The sentences on the wheel are very similar to those on the lists, he doesn't like to be taken off, but he's fine even if he catches on. He didn't pass only 1 boy, who was entitled to it. I highly recommend it! ! !"
4103,"An excellent hotel. We were in the evening and the first impression - a huge, illuminated hotel, which is breathtaking. As for the interior - a new center, all clean, neat, neat, although I personally did not like the style. I do not like too much for such ""nouveau riche"" style. Mixing with entanglement, here something modern, here gold, here glass. The rooms are clean, quite large, nothing to add, nothing to put it into words (the only thing you can attach to is a large heavy bathroom door that closes by itself and this can make it difficult for example children). Delicious food is a big choice. Lots of attractions - spas, swimming pools (one for children, one for recreation, one for sports and brine), jacuzzi, salt cave, sauna area, night club. What's more, New Year's Eve was well organized."
4105,"During the briefing, Jadwiga Emilewicz, Minister of Entrepreneurship and Technology, assessed that Polish biotechnology is being developed at the Polpharma centre in the Gdańsk Science and Technology Park. ""It is here that a new generation of drugs is being developed, which - as she evaluated - are more effective, more tailored to the patient's needs and completely harmless"" - she pointed out. She expressed her hope that ""this will make Poland a biotechnological hub for Europe and certainly for Central and Eastern Europe in the coming decades (...)"". She pointed out that ""the government has been supporting Polpharma's investment plans for many years, granting further permits for the company to operate in the Pomeranian Special Economic Zone"". She reminded that ""the possibility of investment in the Special Economic Zone are tax privileges"" ."
4106,"Coming from Wroclaw, in 7 people decided to go for dessert to the local restaurant - however, our attention was drawn to the gates - entrance 24 PLN, so we went to 2 gates to the hotel, where we heard that through this gate there is no entry and we have to go back to the first one and pay the entrance fee (a baby in a pram and a set of pregnant women - no discount). We decided to return to the car and go to another restaurant: ) Congratulations on your stupidity: ) frankly - I DO NOT RECOMMEND : ) PS . And what is this fee for anyway? ? ? . . ."
4107,"Evaluation: Mr. Jerzy is a pretty cool mathematician to go through, although he is quite eccentric, but not as bad as you might think. I had 'em with him analysis 1 and it was quite interesting. . . Colloquia makes ambitious, so it is worth learning. He has an unusual approach to mathematics, he comes up with tasks by himself and does not use a script. He likes to be active on exercises and collects a lot of points for that. It is also worth fighting on wheels to the end, because it can pay off. What matters to him is the way of thinking and approaching tasks. He puts points for the way of thinking, even if the task is not fully solved or is wrongly solved. In general, it is positive, but quite difficult. I do not recommend it to those who count on an easy pass."
4109,"The most pity is that the location of the hotel is very pleasant. . . .it's probably the only plus. . . . .the rest is the standard of a two-star resort (no offense). . . .and the lack of towel change and even a general vacuuming of the room and bathroom during a week's stay is a mockery. . . .if you don't have to, let go of the visit to this place"
4110,"The hotel is located in the heart of the city. Entrance to the underground car park is connected with the acceptance of the regulations, i.e., among others, the price. I do not know how it is in other cities, but in this hotel the cost of parking for 2 days was 35% of the cost of stay. Exiting the underground car park is not optimistic, but it is ok in the hotel hall. To get to the floor use the card in the elevator. Also after possible visiting friends you have to bother to go downstairs. The big room . However, the room has a small, old, archaic TV. Bathroom with bathtub, but the towel change only after intervention at the reception."
4111,"Unfortunately, great disappointment. On the first visit everything is fine, a thorough interview, a lot of research was commissioned (for a total of about 2 thousand PLN). The second visit lasted only 3 minutes, professor did not even examine his wife (and said that he would take care of the infection he noticed). He said that everything is fine (and the wife does not ovulate and that is what we reported to him) . Then. . . . . . .he told me to go to another doctor from another clinic (he gave a specific name). . . They asked us for a reason - no reason. Complete disrespect for the patient. . . . He was very disappointed in us."
4112,"The hotel is ideal, situated in a fairytale place in the middle of a forest surrounded by mountains! Everything in the best possible order, Polish animators ""super"" always helpful! The form of all inclusive just not to be overdone and drunk! Every day new dishes to choose from and really everyone will find something for everyone :) and when it comes to alcohols, I was not much need to be lucky except for jack danielsa, that's what made me happy: ) and seriously this is what to choose from in alcohol: ) a mini-bar in the room once a day refilled. Coffees of various kinds served in the lobby. The hotel smells still new and maybe the hotel staff has to learn a little more but I think it will get better every month! Quite interesting is the location of the hotel between iicmeller and marmaris and all this is connected by a beautiful promenade. The hotel security really takes care of the safety and you can feel safe and secure. The hotel has met our expectations, and we will definitely come back there :)"
4113,"I'm warning everyone to see this ""doctor""! ! ! We were at this gentleman's for an ultrasound of his daughter's hips. On the basis of the examination, the gentleman diagnosed dysplasia of one of the hips and recommended to put on the apparatus. Not a word of explanation as to what apparatus, what to do next, how to proceed. When asked what kind of apparatus, you said that I will read the description of the examination. We left the office without the necessary information on how to proceed, from the description of the examination it appeared that he recommended putting on the shirt dill, that is, as we later found out, practically immobilizing the infant for at least 6 weeks - a nightmare. Fortunately, we decided to verify the diagnosis in 2 other reputable orthopaedists. It turned out that the hips are all right, nothing has to be treated! ! ! Lost nerves and money for additional visits are unfortunately no longer recoverable. To sum up: I discourage any visits to this gentleman - it is a pity of nerves and suffering of a child unnecessarily tiring in the dill!"
4114,"I don't recommend it. At first, the doctor made a good impression. He visited him 3 times in a year and a half. The basic urine tests detected nothing and despite my kind pressure to deepen the nephrological diagnosis, he told me that without proteinuria and/or leukocyturia there was no chance that I had kidney inflammation, or rather it was a problem with the muscle or the spine (my nephrological symptoms clearly indicated that it was a problem with the kidney!). After almost two years, I finally got 'em to a good doctor who recommended, among other things, an MRI, which left no illusions. My spine is healthy, and my left kidney has a segmental restriction on the diffusion of the renal papillae corresponding to the inflammatory focus. Soon, I will have even more detailed examination. If Mr. Bartholomew Matłosz had immediately approached my case professionally and wanted to take me seriously, the inflammation would not have turned into a chronic form, which unfortunately cannot be cured. . . As a consolation I can only say that most of the other nephrologists I visited did not even want to examine me, seeing the correct basic urine test."
4116,"A small, quiet hotel on the quieter side of the lake. Nice service, very good selected dishes, the climate of the guesthouse with a cozy spa. A great place for a family weekend or even a day's stay. The hotel provides animation for children, and because it is small children quickly acclimatize and have no problems with orientation in the building, which also has a positive effect on parents who can breathe without worrying that the child will get lost. I recommend to those who do not like molochs, and prefer me to be exclusive for this more cozy place."
4117,"She spent a week here on Dr. . Bardadine ( for the third time ) . Nowhere did she meet with such a wonderful staff. Starting with the reception desk, through the restaurant and spa and ending with the cleaning ladies. Always a wonderful smile, professionalism and the willingness to fulfill all (as far as possible) requests. Lots of kindness and care. Spa is a dream. A huge, wonderful offer and professionalism! Kitchen . . . . .which is a lot to talk about. I wasn't hungry at 800 kcal even for a moment. Everything is deliciously tasty and beautifully served. The waitresses and waitresses supported me every step of my diet. Thank you for everything and see you next year!"
4118,"The knowledge is communicated in a very clear and understandable way. The attitude towards the student is as positive as possible . Colloquia normal, but you need to do some work. Overall a very big positive: D"
4119,"Hello, we have purchased our all inclusive stay for two people at the Marine Hotel. Upon arrival, the hotel was really very nice, super-located, but from the very beginning something did not play. They checked in we did not get us wristbands and a 10% discount on services as it was supposed to be in the offer that we bought. We got a 5% discount. After the intervention it turned out that we are entitled to it at the reception desk you did not know (she explained that she had a lot of guests and there is ""snuff"" - that is why she was wrong). In every catering outlet really nobody knew what these bands mean and what sofas and alcoholic beverages can be served. Every time the question was asked which wine, which vodka. It was tiring to explain to the staff that we have the package. Apparently, every time you had to sign a 0 PLN bill. Once we only got it. In addition, when we went to the restaurant we were surprised by a cobweb hanging over the table and it wasn't one, because there was a whole bunch of them, in the hotel 5 *? The HK department couldn't do anything. At the swimming pool it was the same, above the deckchairs. I guess it's not the hotel 5 * standards. A very nice nightclub on level 1 in the hotel. The spa was ok, but you can better massage yourself in the hotel 3 *, there although the staff has flip-flops with covered fingers (when you are massaged you do not admire the male feet / nails) And at the very end when we left the hotel, the lady at the reception desk counted us a bill of 100 zł more, because of course she did not know that we have all inclusive. After explaining to her that we have wristbands and such a package the bill was 100 PLN less. Question to the organizers why organize an offer for guests staying all inclusive if the staf was not informed? And every time a guest has to explain what is going on, wait for the bartender to call the reception and ask. Maybe it is worth taking a picture of the wristband and hang it in a prominent place? Unfortunately, despite a very cool location, the translation was tiring every time. . . I hope that the next people who buy this package will not have to ""fight"" like us."
4120,"We had the dubious pleasure of sitting there. The hotel and especially the staff stopped in the times of the People's Republic of Poland - the décor is full of garishness and the staff is often not taught enough, it is often reminiscent not only of the behavior but also the costume of the People's Republic of Poland - as long as the costumes are the fault of the managers - it is an approach to the customer that gives a strong sense of how tired you are, this work is at least out of place. Mass food, without enthusiasm, and for this price you can expect something more. It is also not to hide that the climate is influenced by a rather specific clientele while the hotel can not influence it."
4121,"I have rather mixed feelings after seeing this doctor. She made an appointment with her child for a consultation, nothing serious, she just wanted my advice. She made an appointment especially for an earlier hour so I wouldn't have to wait with the child in long queues. We were the second in line. Unfortunately, the doctor was 15 minutes late and the person before us was admitted for 45 minutes! After we entered, of course, I'm not sorry. 2 days after this visit, the child does not want to eat, I keep crying, I look into my mouth and there are whole cheeks on the inside in erosions. A child 3 years old has never even had aphtha. By coincidence or some dirty tool put in the mouth? 130 zloty for the infection with some kind of pigsty . Thank you very much."
4123,"The poor assessment was not for the competence, but for the approach to the patient, lack of patience, I was not allowed to say a word, I tried several times to ask a question, but I was not able to interrupt the doctor, I was not able to say a word, ask a question, present my doubts. In my opinion, the doctor did not carry out a full interview, which could have contributed a lot, no examination was carried out, the doctor was also not interested in the contents of the CT record. I am very disappointed with her visit, for which she waited several weeks."
4124,"It took the Hyatt Regency Warsaw Hotel ""10 years to get the hang of it. It would seem that quite unexpectedly, and yet ... the facility celebrated its tenth birthday on 19 April with a ceremonial concert. Soloists of Concerto Avenna and talented and - despite their young age - titled cellist Bartosz Koziak - presented themselves in the repertoire of Haydn and Mozart. The concert was followed by a less formal and official gastronomic part. The event was attended by 200 - 250 invited guests, mainly people associated with the Warsaw Hyatt: guests and clients. Among them there were people of culture, officers, politicians, managers and economic activists, as well as some so-called celebrities. The Hyatt Regency Warsaw was opened in 2001 after three years of construction. It has 250 rooms, 9 floors with a garage, spa, swimming pool, restaurant and casino in the basement."
4126,"Looking for a suitable surgeon she found me on this portal and thanks to it she made my choice. That was a bull's-eye. Before the surgery, she was afraid of me, but the fear, thanks to the person of the Doctor, vanished somewhere. The procedure was painless and the wound healed with the speed of light. Mr. Dr. Niziołek is nice and cordial and has golden hands. He is a great surgeon, the right person in the right position. He is a very high-class man. I recommend him to everyone. My daughter is finishing medicine and she's going to become a surgeon, she wants the doctor to be a model for her. Doctor, I wish you professional success, good health and thank you very much."
4127,"The doctor did a basic neurological examination, but after the visit she felt unsatisfied, she had to ask me if everything was okay. She was given a prescription painkiller and a diagnosis: it could be a vascular headache (that is, as I understand it, it could also be something else). The visit lasted 10 minutes and cost 120 PLN."
4128,"We were at the doctor's office for a hip test with our daughter, and he was very rude from the very beginning. The examination of the ultrasounds with consultation 230 PLN and we could not get anything concrete out of it! We had to literally pull it by the tongue, we were very disappointed with our approach, both to us as parents and children. He diagnosed a dysplasia of the left hip and had the device put on again immediately. It seemed strange to me because before that we had been with a physiotherapist who examined the little one very carefully and said that the hips were all right. So we consulted another doctor and it turned out that the little one has no dysplasia at all! I would like to add that at the end of the visit (during which he tried very hard to emphasize the importance of the problem he found) he asked: ""I managed to scare you? "" I'm sorry, she thought that the doctor's job is to treat and provide medical services and not to scare patients! Especially for this price. . ."
4130,"The battery has only a nice design. The battery is about 30 cm high. The average depth of the sink is about 20cm. Water flowing out of the faucet and falling from a height of 1 / 2 meters makes you want to rinse the plate or wash your hands to take a shower! The cabinets are splashed and everything in about. She called me a Blanco salesman and asked for advice, but only gave me a phone call to the service technician who had the water pressure screwed on. He also tried to explain that the faucets are suitable for BLANCO sinks and if m bought a Blanco sink there would be no problem. The sieve in the Blanco sink is positioned in such a way that when you point the spout of the faucet at it, the water does not spill out. But who uses a sink and always thinks about pointing the spout at the strainer? ? ? ? ? I guess the one who does nothing in the kitchen! ! So I warn all Blanco faucets and more. Failure and a total bust!"
4131,"During his stay in the vicinity of Poznan, he stayed overnight at Hotel 500 . Clean rooms with nice bedding. The disadvantage is narrow TV beds only dvbt TV 24 inches . Bathroom perfect clean and equipped with basic cosmetics . No hair dryer . Breakfast Swedish table a large choice and tasty . Nice and helpful service ."
4132,"We were encouraged by the low price and location in Paphos. However, the stay itself turned out to be bad as expected. Apart from the cockroaches in the room, I found 'em for the worst breakfast I ever had. Old, very old sausages, not tasty, heated for the hundredth time, which nobody ate, a couple of types of ""plasticine"" hams, crisps with milk and drinks (""juice"" of powder, coffee / tea ) . That's all, for my 8 day stay every day the same. Normally you had to ask them to report because of themselves - they absolutely did not feel such a need. Dinner - dinners I can recommend, they were just delicious, À la carte, a pretty big choice, different every day. The decor of the hotel, from 20 years ago, but we can forgive it. Besides, if you have a car, it's a comfortable base to go to the beach / nearby Lidl. To sum up, if it wasn't for the cockroaches, I would write that the hotel is for the undemanding tourists. And yes - I do not recommend it at all."
4133,"Everywhere is dirty, everything is stained, it smells musty. The cage is like in a tenement house in the old Warsaw's Praga district, only the homeless are missing. They put nice pictures of the place and hopelessness up close. They make people laugh at the bottle that they offer luxurious apartments, and they offer neglected apartments. They say that they will give back the money, and then you have to ask for help, because they do not do that; they do not reply to e-mails. Save yourself a traveler's nerves, you've been through it yourself and I'm doing well for you. I am surprised that this company still exists."
4134,"I am a wheelchair user. When she told me she wanted to have a baby all the doctors were knocking on the head. He was the only one who took me seriously. Today I'm a mother of two beautiful and healthy children. He led both my pregnancies. And although contrary to what was predicted, she felt that I was well cared for, she had regular examinations sometimes with excessive exaggeration (in my opinion): ) When you enter the office, you feel that you are the only one and unique and your fears and worries are not indifferent to it. And just as predecessors wrote - an open-minded man, full of optimism and sense of humour. Very bad qualities in doctors who do not leave money in a private office! ! ! I sincerely recommend it to every woman! ! !"
4135,"You are in Turkey 3 times and never been so cool the food is very good and in mega quantities everyone will find something for themselves equally cool attractions, very cool swimming pools for every age of child aquapark impresses both the youngest and older holidaymakers I highly recommend"
4136,"She treated my boys with Dr. Zawadzka for a while. The diet and hygiene recommendations are very accurate, although rigorous. I did not comply with these regulations in 100% (however, the concessions did not consist in feeding children in McD, bars or sausages : - ) Many of her diagnoses have been confirmed. She liked to write down her guidelines and diagnoses: after leaving the office, half of them were not forgotten. . . We stopped going to see her because I was annoyed by the system of records, waiting for hours late in front of the office, and finally a disrespectful, bordering on contempt, stounek to my husband, who is a foreigner: she regularly asked him out the door. She has a very strange personality. . . . It started to bother me. There are so many excellent doctors, why should I treat children with someone who has slight cultural problems? Respect is just as important as the knowledge of the profession because it's about feeling safe."
4137,"Very good shampoo, but only for small children whose head is washed every day anyway, and whose hair is not too exposed to severe pollution. If your hair is greasy or glued together with hairspray in an adult, this shampoo can't handle it - it's just too fine. And it's not efficient - you need a lot of shampoo to get the foaming effect, but it can be compensated for by a ridiculously low price. I recommend it, mainly for sentimental reasons: )"
4138,"Before buying the radio read em positive reviews and bought em CB radio PRESIDENT Jimmy II now I regret it very much . The radio on a very good antenna receives very badly . There are very large noises that can not be adjusted to compensate for the very distorted reception and transmission. The radio checked em after removing my old HARRY II which received cleanly and broadcasting was not a problem. The mounted radio PRESIDENT Jimmy II is overrated, listened to and broadcast hopelessly. I will add that the test of the radio was conducted in the same place and on the same good antenna. He wouldn't recommend me to use this radio, of course he chooses everyone according to their own beliefs."
4139,"Good news for those who were persecuted with spinach as a child. ""Spinach should be eaten from time to time, but it should not be glorified as a great source of iron,"" - said PAP dr hab . Małgorzata Drywień from the Warsaw School of Life Sciences. Plant products as sources of iron do not work at all. A similar amount of iron as in spinach is found in beef, but only 1% of the former is absorbed. However, only 1% of the former is absorbed, and as much as 20% from beef. Can a combination of cucumber and tomato be a dangerous mixture for our health? Not at all, if we handle them properly. Some plants - including green cucumber - contain an enzyme that oxidizes and destroys vitamin C . So, if you cut into a salad - rich in vitamin C - peppers or tomatoes, you should first pour it over the sauce with a little fat, e.g. olive oil. It will protect our vegetables from the enzyme. Only then can cucumber, which will not take vitamins away from the protected tomato, be sliced into them."
4140,"I have lived in many hotels, in different standards and in very good and budget ones, but this hotel is a new category, the category of the worst of the worst. Beginning with the receptionist who is difficult to communicate with in any other language than German, no elevator, a narrow and steep staircase where you have to squeeze through with your luggage. In the rooms and in the corridor there are motion detectors installed which control the lighting, which is very annoying, standing longer behind the detector's range you stand in the dark and walk in the dark, in the bathroom a ridiculous disco while bathing. Bed linen is clean, but mattresses no longer, under the shower too short a curtain causes flooding of the bathroom during bathing, and the size of the shower forces to stick to this cold and damp curtain. Beware of hot and cold water taps, they are connected the other way round and the marking has not been changed, so the whole first day is washed with cold water. Room with kitchen . . . . .by the bedside this hasn't seen 'em anywhere yet, pinned down at night you can easily boil something for yourself, most simply sleepwalking. Unfortunately, the smells from this kitchen prevent you from sleeping peacefully. Staying by the bedside, everyone will calmly count how many springs have the mattress, all these springs are reflected on the skin. I do not recommend this hotel."
4141,"Booking a DAY earlier than 1 night with a clear and repeated question if there is a party at the hotel (everyone knows what an integration and conference event looks like) we got the answer that the hotel is full, but it is only a hotel guest and there is NO party! ! ! After entering the reception desk about 21h we already knew that we were lied to! ! ! Not only was there an integration party for about 70 people, but it was also a holiday. Hubert, so chasing away the spirit and visiting the castle! ! ! ! Our mistake that we stayed, but with 2 thousand kilometers to go, we just wanted to sleep at night, which of course was our dream because we didn't even sleep a wink! ! ! ! The party lasted until about 3-4 hours in the morning, bang, singing and madness even in the corridor, the more so as we got a room almost next to the party (the Count's apartment). Our hotel day lasted 3 hours and while paying, the receptionist told us with a cold face that this is a conference and integration center so she does not understand what we mean, we had the feeling that we are some strange people who wanted to sleep in the Kliczkow Castle Hotel! We feel lied to and deceived and to this day we can not understand how to treat people like this. Since our departure we have been trying to call your manager, but unfortunately nobody answers the phone!"
4142,I've been there for many years during my vacation and for many years I've been claiming that it's the best place to eat in the area - - I mean just a restaurant. But I think this year was the last time I saw 'em. The place is still beautiful and it's a nice place but that's all. . . Eating is boring and getting worse - - service under the dog (total oiling and lack of professionalism) - - sitting in the restaurant at the table you hear a stupid bell every now and then that someone entered the reception desk . . you get mad. . . .
4144,"Very kind Doctor, she has a very positive and gentle attitude to work. The only thing I missed in my visits was a certain lack of conversation, advice from the Doctor but maybe it was also a result of my situation or she wanted to hear something from the Doctor herself and in fact there was nothing to say. Nothing, I generally recommend."
4145,"A fantastic location with a beautiful view of Kefalos Bay and Kastri Island, which you can reach. The swimming pool is also a place where you can enjoy the beautiful views. The residence is far away from the hotels and the area is very quiet. It is the ideal place to relax if you like the silence. Accommodation according to the offer. The owner of Kostas was very nice and gave valuable information on how to get to know the area. This is my next magical place, which I will remember and recommend to all who want to relax on the island Kos near Kefalos. Thank you for your stay."
4146,"ATTENTION WITH PACKAGES ( and all other hotel reservations ) ! ! ! She and her husband booked a package for Valentine's Day on the hotel website. We paid for a room with a view of the sea. After a few days we read EMAIL with the information that there is no possibility to combine beds in the room - no information on the website. She called me to the hotel asking for an exchange for another room. It was not possible to exchange or ""connect the beds, because physically, it is not possible, THE ROOM IS A BIG STAGE"". For 3 days she tried to call my manager because without her it is impossible to cancel the reservation! ! Today you told me that it is too late to cancel and the advance payment is lost, the arguments related to the failure to comply with the conditions at the time of conclusion of the contract you heard m "" our primary form of communication is e-mail, what is given by phone, you could check the mail ( . . . ) actually last time I was no more in the hotel than I was m , and other employees are instructed to talk to me about the cancellation "" . Additionally, the lady at the reception started to laugh on the phone. This is the first time I have dealt with such treatment of guests and lack of culture! ! !"
4147,"The new Windows from Microsoft was supposed to revolutionize the computer system market, but in fact nothing has improved. Many proven solutions have not been introduced, mistakes instead of being fixed long ago, have been thoughtlessly copied to the new system, and functionality is limited. The only novelty that I may like is the graphical interface, although I did not like it at all. The tools for management and administration have been very much reduced, the system has not been made safer by the need to confirm every operation and the time to run both Windows and applications has been greatly extended. Many applications are not compatible with Vista and trying to run your favorite programs or games may not work. The hardware requirements are also sick of such a poor operating system. Better systems with much more capabilities than Vista, run much faster, have half the requirements and cost much less. The result is that Microsoft must force users to buy and use its system by installing it on laptops or computers sold in stores, because who in their right mind would buy this bubble on their own? I advise against it, it is worth waiting for 7, or even better to stay with XP."
4148,"Phaedra Beach is located about 2 km from the town centre, but that's only a plus because you can't hear the noises from the events taking place and there aren't too many youngsters on quads and scooters. The hotel itself was clean and tidy, our room was spacious, nicely furnished, cleaned daily, air conditioning was free of charge. For children, many attractions - swimming pools, mini club, evening mini disco. Paid beach service - 6 E / dz for 2 sun beds and an umbrella. Restaurant all inclusive - large, but still during lunch and dinner you had to unfortunately usually wait. The food is very good, the service is nice, I sincerely recommend."
4149,"Those assessing their health as good are of the opinion that adequate nutrition (53%) and regular sporting activities (31%) contribute most to improving their health. Doctor's visits were only ranked third ( 28% ) . Those who are not satisfied with their health, on the other hand, cited health promoting activities mainly as regular medical check-ups (47%) and only later as healthy eating habits (43%) . In this group of respondents, physical activity is definitely going downhill. Four-fifths of respondents ( 81% ) consider themselves to be health-conscious, of which almost one fifth ( 19% ) have no doubt about it. Nearly one in five respondents (19%) admit to not caring about their health."
4150,"I warn against this doctor! I was with him twice - he never examined me, he doesn't listen to what you say to him, he doesn't do an interview. When she described her ailments he said that she probably already had m (although he saw me for the first time in his life), despite the hard work he didn't refer me to L4 when I was pregnant but he scared me to lie down in draught at the observation in the hospital. He said that he may believe that I am not feeling well, but there is nothing he can do about it, because he needed a safety STRONG. He didn't look at the reported infections, he just wrote a prescription, never go to him as your health is nice! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
4151,"The doctor's office was once and he let 'em down a lot. The visit itself was very nice but, a professional impression. The choice of medicines for the beginning of the treatment is not even so much unfortunate as it is strongly exaggerated. The doctor does not save on resources and saves at the same time 3 steroid drugs as 1 treatment which, as I now know from other doctors is inadvisable especially when assessing the disease ""on sight"" and may lead to serious side effects . When I was taking the drugs everything was fine but the side effect was already 3 days after the end of the treatment, a few times worse than at the beginning, even lamentable, I had on my face a big swollen butterfly in the color of violet and red covered with abscesses as if sprinkled with flour . I don't recommend it, the doctor takes ill-considered actions which may end badly in the long run."
4152,"1 . They treat a man as a thief: payment at check-in, dressing gowns issued on deposit (no slippers in the SPA ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) 2 . Very big problems with the parking lot when you get to the conference3 . The decoration of the room - it is not the most positive - terribly dark rooms, bathrooms - ""late game"" . . 4 . The walls are so thin that you can hear every word of the neighbours. . . And as they party (which is quite standard for a conference) - you can't sleep. . 5 . Juices on breakfast - diluted water6 .

I am very glad that I have just been operated on by Dr. Krzysztof Tomasiewicz. Tomasiewicz, a great professional, courteous, always answers the phone, when he cannot answer the call, the patient feels cared for by the doctor from the very beginning. He has perfectly illustrated my illness, where so far others have misled me (just ignorance on the part of doctors), which allowed me to trust this doctor and undergo surgery as soon as possible, for a year I have been on strong painkillers (leg pain, numbness, nerve damage, sleepless nights). I recommend this doctor, a very good professional. . . . . . . . Thank you very much, Doctor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .I greet your patient Anet. . . M ."
4157,"Dr. Karolina Kusnierek is in my eyes a dentist in a slow motion. Very thorough examination of the filling preceding any work, photographic documentation, taking X-rays - all this was to make sure that one of the teeth was qualified for possible treatment, and also to allow the patient to see with his own eyes, which worries the doctor. I really enjoyed Mrs. Caroline's approach to prosthetic correction, which was the main reason for my last visit to the office. The doctor listens to the patient first, asks what aesthetic effect would be satisfactory for him, and then he informs precisely and reliably how it looks from the medical and functional point of view - the shape and size of the teeth carefully selects to the bite of the patient. He always chooses the least invasive solutions and thus they are most often a pleasant surprise to the patient when it comes to costs. The doctor always informs you about the cost of treatment at the first visit and these are the maximum amounts that the patient can bear - sometimes they are reduced - so anyone can plan these expenses without any unnecessary stress. I recommend Dr. Karoline Kusnierek to all those who care about their smile and are looking for a professional who can take the best care of him."
4159,"I believe that Mrs. Dr. J. Slusiewicz is a professional in every way. One look at her and she already knows how to set up further treatment. In my case, the treatment lasted for a short time with the assumed 15 months, the process ended at 10 months . To my surprise, the treatment was painless, which is probably important for everyone. You could say that she reminded me of the apparatus at the time of the visit. Besides, all questions and doubts are explained both by the doctor and the staff (very well trained, nice). You could say that ORTOPROTEX is a high European level. I recommend Aga D ."
4160,"Very poor communication from the doctor. During the visit I did not get such basic information as: what are the primary causes of my illness, whether additional examinations are recommended (if yes: what), what should be changed so that the problem does not return. I was given a prescription for allergy medication, but here too the doctor did not try to explain the relationship between the allergy and my condition. It seems natural to me that it should be natural for a doctor to introduce the patient to his chosen treatment strategy. 10 minutes and the next client."
4161,"My stay at IBIS Poznań was the second in several years. The hotel is similar to IBIS Budget if you consider the size of the room, layout, equipment. The room because yes should be written a little too small for two people. There was one comfortable chair or a small meaningful table missing. The number and setting of channels on TV leaves a lot to be desired. You would like to have more programs and their setting is appropriate (searching from 1 to 100 irritates). I can add to the cost. Parking for 40 zloty is a bit crazy, similarly to a breakfast of 70 zloty for two people. Prices as if converted directly from Euro . In general, I think this hotel is good. You can sleep comfortably, there is a sense of security. The only doubts I have are about the price/quality ratio. However, this is a purely individual matter."
4162,"The hotel is located in close proximity to the railway station, a few minutes walk from the Main Square. There is also a large shopping centre nearby. The rooms are Ibis budget compliant: small, but clean and well maintained. The beds are very comfortable and allow for a good rest. Breakfast - also for a hotel of this class - is very good. Wide range of different dishes (hot and cold: sausages, cheese, muesli, yoghurt, milk, two kinds of bread, several kinds of teas, coffee and juices). The hotel is also worth recommending because of its price."
4163,"The Doctor got 'em needing urgent help with a shot of the finger of the hand, and he got 'em such very quick help - thank you very much ! He also got 'em all the necessary medications and instructions, and subsequent visits confirmed a quick cure. However, I still had problems with the treated finger and also another one of the same hand and suspecting another source of them decided to check em if the previous treatment is definitely finished . This time also the visit met my expectations, but reserving the date of the visit 5 days earlier on the Portal, after coming to hear em in the Registration that I have to wait in line with people (many) who appeared that day earlier. It is obvious that some people should enter without a queue and that visits to doctors can be prolonged, but those registering through the Portal should not feel that entering at a fixed time is ""without a queue"" . I have managed to make this visit with quite a big shift, but for this last problem I have to add a minus to the evaluation - that is the final evaluation is 5 - ."
4164,"She came to the hotel because she expected me to rest away from the center. Eating as much as possible, however, the service is terrible, the strange smell in the room, and also no rest at night through the events taking place at the hotel. Not to mention the fact that the partygoers were additionally disturbed by loud chants, which no one was able to silence. We felt like we were in a dorm, and yet it is a hotel that boasts 4 stars."

4167,"Hello! She wanted me to recommend Dr. . Kędzie, he cut out my son's almonds, professional, patient, professional, hasn't met such a person for a long time, he cut out the almonds at the National Health Fund in the Diagnostic and Medical Center, where in the hospital she would have to wait 10 months for this procedure. The son very roughly came to health already after three days there was no trace of the procedure. Believe me, during this procedure she was calm and without any signs of nervousness because she knew what kind of a good specialist I entrust my child to :) Greetings and thanks to Mr. Doctor and all the staff for their care : )"
4168,"The researcher analyses interactions between endocanabinoids and endovanilloids . The cannabinoids formed within our body are called endogenous (endocanabinoids). One of them is the analogue of THC ( tetrahydrocanabidiol ) - anandamide . The endocanabinoid system is the internal system of our body. Results of the work of dr hab . Starowicz - Bubak will indicate new directions in neuropathic pain therapy . The scientist is checking on which systems, receptors or molecules can act to treat and relieve chronic pain. ""As a result of our project there will be no new injection or tablet which can be bought in a pharmacy after the completion of the project. However, we will identify the molecules that best confirm our hypothesis and examine their pharmacological properties"" - explains Dr Starowicz - Bubak. The work of her team can give guidance to pharmaceutical companies on how to design drugs. At the stage of basic research it is not yet about licenses or patents."
4169,"A very weak doctor. I went to him a month after a curettage procedure after a miscarriage. She wanted the doctor to examine me, check if I was okay, especially since I have a large erosion and it would be good to remove it. Dr. Szymula did not see the need to examine me, and did not give the ultrasound she asked me for, claiming that it also does not make sense. She had the impression that the doctor was bored with the visit. ."
4171,"I've had a problem with leg cramps for many years. Lately, almost every night I have had to get up to ""go away"" with pain in my legs. At night, she was afraid to strain my leg muscles and even turn from side to side so that she wouldn't ""grab"" me a contraction. After the first visit to Mr. Przemek's place, the problem with night-time attacks of cramps was actually over. After the second visit my legs were already so loose that I am stretching them in different directions without fear of a contraction. I highly recommend Mr. Przemek, he is not only a great professional but also a very nice and cultured man."
4172,"Who writes positive reviews here? The rooms in the building are neglected, it smells badly of moisture. Bathrooms are neglected, fungus. I have pictures of 2 different rooms taken. The fungus is grated, provisionally painted. Monotonous menu . Someone likes cold eggs. People, the heater and they'll be hot. Melted cheese flipped from breakfast to dinner. One dinner won - nothing warm. Lament with the greaves. Still the same. The commune. And with a mushroom, it's a sanitary facility. I'll send the pictures and wait for interventions. We had a child who got sick after our stay. And I won't let it go. I wouldn't recommend 100%."

4175,"Doctor very arrogant treats the pac moles like an idiot, I do not know how this man can cure children in my forfeit approach to a child pity to talk. Moreover, he didn't come up with the idea to have a test to diagnose the cause of the disease and yet this should be the basis. I think that the praise of this doctor is exaggerated to me the child was not cured but treated with poor results. The real doctors are getting less and less - you are either an artist or a craftsman in this case definitely the latter. Taking money for something you have to at least be nice to the client from whom you live! ! !"

I see myself on average once a month because this is how I have my appointments combined with my research. My feeling is very positive. The truth is that he doesn't say much. But I think it's an advantage. He doesn't fuckin' care. He is specific. He'll provide information and explanation for every question. The same goes for the disease itself as well as the current and anticipated treatment. 4 or 5 years before that, I was there with the same symptoms at another doctor and left 'em as supposedly ""healthy"" . After that time, Dr . Holub immediately accepted the correct diagnosis . I am positive about Dr. Holub. Adam . . . I recommend it as a good doctor . In the future, I will try to make my voice heard and share further observations."

You can also rest as much as possible. Breakfast was not ordered in b & b la fontaine. But from 8 o'clock you can eat at the market, in the restaurant."
4180,"A completely irresponsible man. He did not detect my diabetes, even though he had it examined by himself - it was only a month after his visit that I was referred to the diabetes clinic by a doctor from the emergency room in the Bielany hospital. In the 31st week of pregnancy she had to ask for a referral to the control room - in addition, the doctor was very outraged that registration enrolled me for this examination without his approval. I will not mention the fact that when appointing the appointment, e.g. in a month's time, he did not issue an order to register me for the above mentioned appointment, so she went to the hospital three or four times, checked in with a receipt, because Mr. Dr. Dr. did not have time for me (because he either caught up after his leave at MADER or after his dismissal, or took over the patients of other doctors who were on leave). . . Generally MASAKRA ! ! ! Unpleasant, incompetent, rude - for ""good morning"" he addressed me by my name. . . It could have been a long time ago - in other words, I do NOT recommend it! ! ! ! !"
4182,"When I read the opinions about this doctor, I have the impression that I was visiting another person. She didn't take my time (the visit lasted about 5 minutes), she didn't explain anything, she just wrote a prescription and threw in how often she took the medicines, she had to ask about everything and she answered very briefly anyway. She had the impression that the patients were a necessary evil for her. Apart from her ability to talk to the patient, which I do not value the most at all at doctors, I must also pay attention to the very course of the visit - she is completely not interested in anything else but what happened to her. Lack of gynaecological and obstetric history, not to mention general or family history. She doesn't ask questions about diseases, pregnancies, currently taking permanent drugs, chronic diseases or anything else. If she does not know anything about the patient, how should she carry out any treatment? I must admit that she has never met a gynaecologist who would treat a patient so superficially. - In every visit, it started with questions about general health, past pregnancies, surgeries, etc. and the breast examination during the visit was a standard procedure. I was disappointed."

4184,"All in all, the hotel is disappointing. The rooms are ugly (the pictures on the website are rooms already renovated from the 8th floor, the rest is old e.g. the one where she was. The choice of TV channels is VERY modest. No electrical sockets, not only by the bedside, but in the room at all. In the rooms closer to the Palace of Culture, the view obscures and darkens the big banner. In each room the same image on the wall. . . . ( picture ) But the worst horror was breakfast. Not only is the price VERY inadequate for quantity and quality, but also the chance to find a place in the breakfast room borders on a miracle - any, let alone clean and tidy. In order to eat in a nice and clean space, you have to provide it for yourself, i.e. you have to take the dishes and prepare the setting by yourself (as in the attached picture), the staff is not too interested in helping."

Unfortunately, it takes up a lot of space in the garage, and it's terribly noisy. the installer said that this is how it is with split units. for that it was very good to pull in has dirt. but here it was also bad. a week of time we were wondering what to do here, until finally we came up with the idea that we would replace the vacuum cleaner at the installer with some bima. and so we did. unfortunately it turned out that the wife was right, bim better :)"
4186,"I strongly advise against the Professor. All that matters to him is that everything should agree with the NFZ, because we wanted a pass for the weekend, however, Mr. Marek said that he wouldn't talk because the money from the NFZ won't come back. I had the impression that Professor Marek directed me to the hospital so that the students could learn from me. Being there in the ward she couldn't stand it, Mr. Marek said that he would send me to a psychologist and that she never had such problems. But those students couldn't stand coming and the crossbow examined my reflexes with hammers. A nightmare. My mother's requests did not work when she went to see Mr. Professor to ask the students not to examine me Mr. Professor was outraged, he said that this is a hospital and asked who to study at. When my mother went to ask the student who was leading the doctor Ewa Wesołowska about the treatment, this lady with a smile on her face stated that there is no treatment. If someone cares about their health, I strongly advise against being in this hospital with such people, because nothing good will come of it! ! !"

TVs downstairs in the bar to be replaced - broken cathode ray tube and poor reception - with Euro is unacceptable. They participated in the trip as an organized group. Eating below all standards (3 days of frozen row weighs: carrots, cauliflower and broccoli as an addition to the main dishes). The broth with frozen Italian broth, the evening with barbecue which was fried earlier and served in the heaters. Chicken two days in a row was hard.

4190,"The doctor treated us very, hmm, I don't even know how to put it. We came in with the swollen eyes of a 3-month-old infant. We were the last patients that day, so I guess that's why the visit lasted 5 minutes. The doctor assumed in advance that the tubules were clogged, she looked into the eyes of the little one, wrote a referral to the hospital for the procedure and goodbye. She also had to stay with the saline. The doctor did not even give anything moisturizing to wash the eyes. We didn't give up, we went to another specialist, the bark was thoroughly examined and said it wasn't tubules, we were given a wash and drops. After 3 weeks there is no trace of the problem, and after the diagnosis of the doctor, not only would we wait 2 months for the procedure, but we would also unnecessarily fight the baby! ! ! And the problem would not disappear anyway."

You can't sleep until 24 - 02 at night. It's just like at a concert - tragedy - a neglected room, broken shower window, falling tiles, not closing the balcony door - nice staff but treating you like Poles. So to the Russians and Germans very kind and to the Poles for a good day. It was enough for me but with the naked eye you can see the differences, as it is in Turkey - location. There is nothing there. A total depression. One stop. To civilization 15 km . For that noise, I totally advise against this hotel. I don't know why all Poles got balconies from the adjacent hotel: ("

Our resort is founded on a SPA plus hotel. As a rule, the SPA is an addition to the hotel, with us it is the opposite. SPA is the basis of a wide range of wellness, massages, oriental rituals and a set of specialized, high quality cosmetic services. And what fits under the term wellness we also have, of course, that is a swimming pool, jacuzzi, saunas, baths, salt cave. Do you know a facility in the Podkarpacie region, which offers a similar range of services? There is no such . Maybe Arłamów will have a similar offer, but we have a different scale of the facility. In May we'll have 40 rooms on 10 hectares, not 250. We offer intimacy, intimacy and the highest comfort."

And although initially the ointment helped a little, it did not for long. At the control visit (also 5 minutes) she received the same advice - further use of the ointment. The problem stopped for a while, from then on the pain appeared from time to time and from the beginning of this week the same thing happened. My assessment is neutral because the visits were very short and the Doctor himself instead of giving me detailed information referred me to the knowledge on the internet. In addition the Doctor was not very empathic and as a patient I did not feel ""well covered by medical care""."

At the Arkadia Hotel it was quiet for an hour. Around 8 p.m. a group of people came and had a good time. But it was an hour or two and then there was a noise like a marketplace. But I thought it was like any hotel has a so-called night silence. Not a hundred, but there's no nighttime silence in this hotel. And so I called you around 24 hours a.m. to ask you when there will be night-time silence because there is always loud talking, screaming, roaring, screaming of girls, etc. and we already have almost 24? Of course, the intervention was followed by an hourly intervention, which was close to 1 o'clock. And so I thought maybe I could get some rest. Not a hundred but after 4 am the group started to wake each other up by knocking from room to room and I think from what I heard they were having fun. I was up all night and slept maybe 3 hours. And so I got up at 7 a.m. I ate breakfast and I thought about it. . . . How am I gonna get home now when I sleep standing up? Of course, it was my first and last night in this hotel. The big mistake and disadvantage of this hotel is that there are about 20 rooms upstairs. There is no chance to rest in this hotel: ("

Breakfast is more than modest, minced meat, cheese product, some tomatoes (not every day), very watered-down drinks and stale bread, some jam, terrible yogurt and artificial honey. Dinners, which had to be bought out (departure from Ithaca) terrible (one unsavoury dish, salad (one for two people) consisting of two slices of tomato and a few lettuce leaves, sometimes even without oil and for dessert a little watermelon or a small piece of dry dough. As a result, we fed ourselves in a nearby tavern where it was delicious and cheap (the Pirofani Tavern). The owners of the hotel are eternally sour (only daughter can smile) and do not even greet their guests. In the evenings, the father throws things left by the pool into the trash can (unbelievable but we witnessed how at the last minute a tourist pulled out his mattress and inflatable toy). The owner first assigned us rooms, and after a few hours she made a brawl and ordered us to pay extra or to take out to others, because these were supposedly ""superior"". The difference was that the better ones had renovated bathrooms. It was only the intervention of a resident from Ithaca that made us stay in the existing ones, although the word ""sorry"" was not mentioned."
4205,"The hotel is located close to the airport (can be reached on foot), only a charming promenade with a pebble beach separates it from the ocean. The hotel is very good both in terms of room (4 p.m. with a view of the town and the ocean) and the entire infrastructure. I would like to point out that we were on holiday with all inclusive option and the food was delicious! I am very satisfied with the taste of the food (although less with the result + 3kg). Wine was served to each meal (white / red), and to breakfast there was even champagne :) . It is worth noting the cleanliness in the restaurant and in the whole facility. The service is very nice and helpful especially for the elderly, who in this hotel but also in Madeira are probably 80% of tourists: mainly French, Germans and Poles: ) This is not a hotel for families with children (no animation and attractions for children), so I recommend it to those who appreciate peace and quiet :) As mentioned earlier, the hotel is located on a cobbled promenade in a small but very charming town of Santa Cruz with bars. There is also a post office, a pharmacy, a bazaar with fruit and fish. In the evening, the hotel has attractions but this is not the strongest point - I liked the band that played live - the rest very average. In the town itself after 3 days there is rather nothing to do, it is a hotel rather for people who appreciate peace and quiet. Hotel in a good location for a trip to the capital (about 20km). You can book the day before the bus for free from the hotel or go by city bus on a very charming but longer route approx. 50min . It is also worth renting a car and visit the whole island (I think max 2 days). Pluses: location, good food, cleanliness, free safe, tight windows and well-muted buildingMinus: - wifi, which practically did not work in the room but I think they will improve the theme on the so-called. season. - Cold swimming pool - for 7 days, maybe 4 people were swimming in it, so called ""walruses"": BUT there is an indoor swimming pool in the hotel which of course you can useAdditional attraction: planes: ) The weather at the beginning of May is different - it rained, blew, clouds and the sun, which is all that the island of Madeira can bring: )"

4215,"Saturn Palace is an unusual place. Both the hotel and the Roman Terms have made a huge impression on us. The thermal baths are a paradise for sauna visitors. The building is very well equipped, great sauna sessions. We were also very pleased with the treatments. We used the wSPAnia³'s package to relax the two of us. The restaurant serves delicious food, although the prices are as in Warsaw. The apartment is nicely decorated, large and spacious. Huge whirlpool bath. The only disadvantage was the beds joined with two single mattresses and a hole in the middle. In such a high-class apartment I think there should be a bed with one big mattress. Apart from the bed and high prices especially drinks in the restaurant I have no reservations. A great stay, a great place. I recommend it!"
4217,"As far as the rates in Dr. Ufnalewski's office are concerned, they are, by definition, very good. However, very often at the end of a visit a patient finds out that she is paying 80% or 50% of the amount due. Packets like such surprises. That is why, among other things, they visit this office in such large numbers."
4219,"The rooms are very spacious. The decor is not very modern, but clean. With 30 degrees of heat, there was no air conditioning in the rooms. Breakfast in the form of a Swedish table and dinner even tasty and always with some dessert. The SPA area is a bit small for such a number of guests but clean and helpful staff. Large parking lot ."
4220,"The anatomical preparations needed for learning are stored in a special warehouse. Thanks to the closed circulation of the preservative liquid in the plant there is no smell of formaldehyde, and used formaldehyde does not reach the Vistula River with sewage. Many rooms in the Department of Forensic Medicine have been rebuilt and their use has been changed - said its manager, prof . Paweł Krajewski said. Thanks to the cameras, the sections can be viewed in lecture halls, and the building has also been adapted to the needs of the disabled. Among the modern equipment there was a computer tomograph and devices enabling analysis of e.g. traces of afterburner in tissues and blood. In case of such events as plane crash, the plant has a cold store to store 350 bodies in decent conditions."
4221,"Dr. Olender has been performing two eyelid surgery on me. She is a very nice contact person and I do not agree with the opinion that she treats patients as ""meat"". She has performed the procedures professionally and at least under one eye a small haematoma was formed / which I hope will soon be separated / I am satisfied. Gocha"
4222,"The calculations show that in 2000 per 10,000 inhabitants of Poland, men lost 2500 years of life in 2000, and in 2014 less, almost 2200 years. In the case of women, this ratio amounted to 1430 and 1270 years respectively. The biggest life thieves in Poland are cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumours, external causes of death (including primarily traffic accidents and suicides) and diseases of the digestive and respiratory systems. Scientists divided the causes of death into three most important groups. The first group includes infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, diseases related to pregnancy and childbirth, as well as malnutrition. ""This group is important in underdeveloped countries, but in Poland - the rarest one"" - commented Dr Pikala. The second group of causes of death are chronic non-communicable diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. ""This is the most common cause of death in developed countries, also in Poland,"" said the PAP interlocutor. The third group is external causes of death - accidents, suicides."
4223,"We were in this building for the first time and it was a hit, the fact that we were in beautiful weather, thanks to which we could fully enjoy the clean and beautiful beach - there has never been a problem with deck chairs, because there are enough of them, there is a clean and nice toilet, there are some trees on the beach, So you can choose a place in the sun or in the shade, the afternoon we spent in the pool - also clean and tidy, rarely are there crowds despite the full occupancy, the food really good, a lot of own delicious products, we lived in building B - a room clean every day cleaned, Unfortunately the carpet and faucets in the bathroom were destroyed, the rest of the building was very clean, nicely decorated in a simple but elegant style, animations for children at a very good level - animators smiling and full of energy, animations took place in a nice playroom in the middle and a shady place under a big tent outside near the beach, There are so many attractions in the resort itself that we did not even have the opportunity to go around the area, we did not miss anything, the only downside is the lack of coffee for lunch and afternoon tea - classic coffee in the bar for 10 PLN is an exaggeration, the same with regard to alcohol - prohibitive prices, but still the advantages definitely prevailed."
4224,"However, returning to the group of hotels with more than a thousand rooms, the 9th position was taken by hotels belonging to the Military Housing Agency. The group, which for a while promoted itself under the little-developmental name Hotele 21 (there were to be 21 hotels, and even - including e.g. an unrealized project of a hotel for NATO in Bydgoszcz - more). ...hasn't developed for several years. This cannot be said of the Louvre Hotels Group, which is building two hotels in Wroclaw and is on the "" five minutes "" before starting the investment in Bydgoszcz and Zielona Gora. Thanks to an agreement with a branch of PKO BP bank, Qualia Development, seven condo hotels under the brand Golden Tulip Residence will be built within seven years with about a thousand rooms that will operate under franchise agreements. The first of them should be opened this year in Międzyzdroje. The year 2012 should therefore end with over 1.5 thousand rooms. This will place it on 5-6 positions."
4225,"I have had this mouse for three months and it is coming to an end even though I use no more than 2 - 3 hours a day. After the previous entry I find that these mice are either a lottery when it comes to quality, or someone writes reviews a few days after the purchase. Someone wrote a button in a reel that is walking quite hard - in my case it is even too light and wobbly which causes accidental shifts. Rubber elements on the mouse peel off and melt under the heat of the hand and emit an unpleasant smell. I already had different mice - Logitech, A4Tech and each one lasted at least 2 years. Microsoft is a big misfire."
4226,"The hotel is very refined, the rooms are very elegant and very nicely furnished. . Cleaning service twice a day . Breakfast is good, a wide range of products mainly sweet buns imciat le also others. Balconies - ours with a view of the sea. The downside is an ugly table on the balcony with an ugly tablecloth not matching the hotel's decor. For the welcome fruit in the room with a greeting card - very nice gesture . Close to the sea . Quite far to the old city center - about 20 minutes walk ."
4227,"""I have been observing the development of the University Hospital in Olsztyn with great interest. This is a personal success of prof . Wojciech Maksymowicz, but it is also a success and the result of cooperation between the university authorities, the authorities of the Faculty of Medical Sciences and the local authorities. This cooperation has led to something that is unique"" - assessed the minister . He stressed that ""medical studies (launched 9 years ago - PAP) were perceived by many as an experiment with little chance of success"" . As he added, it became quite different. ""Doctors graduating from medical studies and other medical specialists (graduating from the Faculty of Medical Sciences - PAP) are professionals of the highest calibre, and this is evidenced by the rankings of students of medical faculties in Poland, in which the Olsztyn students are in top positions."
4228,"hey Martinellka - I've been going to this doctor not all year long since I came to see him and I was diagnosed with a polycystic ovary syndrome, earlier I went to another doctor and he didn't say that for 2 years he was taking the tablets to make up for the period - Mr Rochalski from the first visit also prescribed me these tablets and then from month to month the same tablets + ultrasound vision tablets - - - tablets + ultrasound vision tablets (and yet too frequent ultrasound also harms health by exposing various organs) and also prescribed me the tablets that my mother takes in diabetes (claiming that they unlock ovaries). Finally, in May this year, he said that if there is no improvement next month, we will start another treatment, but after a month of improvement there was no improvement and again he prescribed the same. It's just been 3 years since we've been trying to have a baby and then nothing - I think I have to change doctor again. I know that it can be cured by laparoscopy, my friend's sister had the same thing done to her laparoscopy and 5 months after the procedure she got pregnant. hello"
4229,"In January 2016 . he started to bleed when he gave up his stool . I belong to the group of direct risk for colorectal cancer . . . . . .so as soon as possible I went to the Proctologist. . . The choice of Dr. Yurczyszyn was dictated by the deadline ( fastest ) . During the visit, em was examined, also with an anoscope. The doctor ruled out hemorrhoidal disease and ordered further examinations to be performed at his friend's (among others . . . rectoscopy) . Despite the age before 40, he immediately decided to perform a colonoscopy (I do not describe the ""doubtful"" pleasure of a few days of preparation for colonoscopy as well as the examination itself). Before the colonoscopic examination the proctologist/surgeon already found hemorrhoids during the examination per rectum, after the anoscope examination he evaluated them for hemorrhoids of II degree. . . . At the end of the colonoscopy he saw 'em hemorrhoids "" from the inside "" on the screen . Perhaps Dr. Yurchyn had a very weak day during my examination. . . . Unpleasant situation, very big stress for me and my family, additional costs of colonoscopy; decided to talk to me with Mr. Doctor. The conversation was nevertheless rather ""cultural"", at the end the doctor returned me 200PLN, which he charged for the visit. . . Still an unpleasant remark - the doctor accepts in a dirty cottage, not so much dirty, just not washed for at least a few weeks. I hope that after you pay attention to the doctor, the next patients will not be greeted by the doctor in a dirty hut (at a cost of 200 PLN). The doctor has very flattering opinions about myeloma treatment, so he is probably not a ""weak"" doctor, but when it comes to proctology, I would definitely not recommend it."
4230,"When I decided to go on holiday to Turkey, I had only a few moments to think about and make a quick decision. The offer from the travel agency looked very interesting and even by the thought of not going through that it could be so different from reality. When she arrived at the hotel, the first impression was, ""This is probably some kind of mistake! ! ! ! ""The hotel from the offer was supposed to be a modern building because the renovation and turned out to be old and completely different than in the pictures from the Vizier offer. Medium rooms, without special equipment, with medium functioning air conditioning. TV as in the communist era with a broken remote control, no fridge. One thing that could be a kind of compensation is free wi - fi , which worked as it wanted and often there was no signal. Bathroom was small tight and medium clean . But you could swallow it and enjoy the beautiful weather and the beautiful sea. The worst was the canteen and boarding. I do not know what the owners meant by offering all inclusive, because the food was nasty and in nothing resembled the famous Turkish cuisine. Besides, it was not very much and even rationed. What was left over from lunch was served for dinner. For the first time I was faced with the situation that the staff sat at the same time as the hotel guests and consumed their meals. The only fruit that was served was the cheapest watermelon, and yet August is the full season for fresh fruit and vegetables. In a word, the disappointment is considerable."
4231,"I reported to Mr. Arkady with a strong, wandering handache. It turned out that it was the result of long-lasting tensions, which had not been known so far, only under the influence of a sudden overload they appeared. The visit started with a discussion about the ailment and a small factual lecture on how our body works and how a sedentary lifestyle affects its functioning. Since the pain was annoying me strongly, Mr. Arkadiusz started the manual therapy. She was on three treatments and the pain disappeared. She received numerous recommendations on how to exercise at home, what kind of activity is best for me. Kindness, calmness, composure, great knowledge are invaluable for the patient features of Mr. Arkadiusz Raven. Thank you : ) Elizabeth"
4232,"I spent one night here with my wife in a double room. For the price of 200 zloty, I expected what I got. A modest, clean room with a large bed, two cairns. The slopes, desk, armchair and chair. Bathroom also clean, with shower. Internet not very fast but it was 6mb / 0,5 Mb. Breakfast ok, Swedish table, fresh bread. There was no decent coffee maker, but otherwise it was ok. One thing that caught my attention was a very comfortable bed."
4233,"Great hotel, great service / brilliant food. On August 8th this year we had a wedding at the Sevilla Hotel for 100 people. International company, guests from all over the world: UK, Ireland, Brazil. We were a young couple like I was a guest who was delighted with the hotel, the decor and the service. The owner of the hotel was with us all night to make sure everything went according to plan. The manager of the room was at every call. The food was delicious and according to the contract, served every minute of the day, with a fixed schedule. Great decorations and decorations. Place with class . I recommend this hotel to everyone for weddings / conferences . Thank you . Cristiane I Grzegorz"
4234,"The biggest advantage of the hostel is undoubtedly its location, in the very centre of the city, a few minutes from the Market Square, a minute from St. Martin. It is also adjacent to the MM Gallery, where you can do shopping and food, cosmetics and clothing, drink coffee (Starbucks) and eat something (supposedly a great Georgian restaurant). Excellent public transport connections (stop literally after leaving the hostel). Inside, clean, quiet, cozy. The only drawback may be the lack of TV. Free internet in the whole hostel. Breakfast is included in the price - modest, but did not require any more. Also available is a shared living room and kitchen."
4235,"I don't know why these two objects, they don't bring anything and give nothing. - The lecture ended with a multiple-choice test with negative points is generally easy and there is nothing to worry about but the lecture is a waste of time because nobody is listening anyway, let alone recording, the slides from the lecture are on the internet. The presence is being checked but there is no influence on anything. because I have returned the page with a request to turn it into html. . . . I ended up with a 5.5 rating, but the whole thing pissed me off: )"
4236,"We stayed in the guesthouse for 4 days, we had a family room booked - I recommend it because it is spacious, clean, quiet at night so we could get some sleep. We also had breakfast, a Swedish table, which we could eat, and I traveled with 2 children (inediates)."
4237,"He painted 'em a small room and already then something I didn't like about that smell, but he went on and gave 'em 2x the latex color. The stench all over the house only appears when fresh air gets into the room through an open window. Just don't open it - don't let the damp air in and the smell disappears. . . Now after 3 months I scratch the paint to a clean finish. The torn off paint panel does not smell, but just soak it in water and it gives ammonia to the cat piss. Dog over 25 years I paint with different primers, paints and varnishes but there was no such thing. And the producer laughs because he knows that no one will do anything to him."
4238,"For nature and horse lovers the Palace and Manor House in Galiny is a perfect place. Beautiful areas, ponds full of fish are a great advantage. Pets are welcome so dog lovers can take their pets with them. We lived in the apartment and in my opinion, the big streak in the corner of the bedroom spoiled the charm of this place: P . Breakfast in the form of a table ""Swedish"" tasty - especially own baked goods, cheese, cold cuts. Dinners - tasty but small portions. The lettuce with vinaigrette served on a tiny salad bar looks very miserable. Delicious dumplings - I strongly recommend, very tasty duck and pork medallions in honey and nut sauce, both items with super noodles flour! : ) A cool offer of regional beers . Red wine house very good . To sum up, a nice place with good cuisine . In the summer, the place is besieged by families with children - it is loud but in autumn it is an ideal time to relax."
4239,"We stayed in this hotel with our son for three days. Very nice and helpful service. At the reception desk we got a map of the city centre, which is a few steps away. Breakfast very tasty you can get a freshly fried omelette very good coffee at the beginning of the day. The apartment where we slept is spacious, modern and quiet, although on the ground floor. We were not on the terrace because it was still raining and was closed. Parking is spacious but payable (35 PLN a day). A very comfortable bed could be a bit harder but for two nights it is ok. In the room there was a kettle of coffee and tea and everything needed for washing. I recommend for a few days to visit Bydgoszcz."
4240,"Unfortunately, after the visit I am very disappointed. The doctor was probably in a bad mood, it was not a nice visit, twice - as a proctological visit and a visit to the doctor who could not unload the atmosphere before the examination. Maybe I was unlucky enough to get on a bad doctor's day, but is this the basis of the attitude towards the patient - worse and better days. The cost of the visit was 150 PLN ."
4241,"As a nice, nice person, but after the procedure I found out that his professionalism sucks. I wanted a complete circumcision,, after discussing everything before the procedure, he got down to work. After the procedure it turned out that the job sucks, ""he uses the conjecture method"" he left me feeling a lot of skin, around the government I have an earned wave of skin so called ""tire"": (I am after the procedure 2 weeks. everything is well healed but the little one looks terrible. I am not satisfied, I have to look again for another doctor to fix it."
4242,"A great doctor. The doctor was leading my first, very much awaited pregnancy. Doctor's approach to the patient is full of professionalism. He has never met such a doctor before. He remembers his patients, all the tests that are questionable are repeated for 100% certainty. She has been given comprehensive answers to every question, even the most banal ones. Under the care of this doctor she felt that both I and my child are safe. Several situations during my pregnancy have confirmed that this is an exceptional doctor, one that is unlikely to be found in our health service. I will certainly be able to lead a second pregnancy with your doctor."
4243,"The hotel was generally quite good, unfortunately it can not be said about the staff, after the arrival it turned out that there is no my reservation made from the hotel website, the room was found but after the first day the owner ran after us into the parking lot thinking that we run away without paying because the lady from the reception did not ask how many days was the reservation (3 days) and gave us a room for one day, In the restaurant got 'em the main course before the starter and I had to remind them about the drinks because they completely forgot, cleaning in the room for 3 days was not necessary to ask us to change the towels, Generally I do not recommend, the comments to the service do not apply directly to employees who are trying and working hard (the same people in the restaurant every day from morning to evening), only to the owner for the terrible mess and organizational chaos, and to top it all off they tried to delete us for 4 days instead of 3 and the bills from the restaurant were also heavily overstated they charged us over 2200 PLN, after noticing that something went well they corrected the payment up to 1600 PLN, blaming the computer program. Generally fatal impressions"
4244,"All the more so because of the blame for the catastrophe, in which 13 people died, and ok . 25 are considered missing, they cannot, on behalf of the company, drop on the weather or the whim of fate. Among the 10 most stressful professions, apart from those mentioned, there is none directly related to the hotel industry or tourism. And Career Cast Portal is included in its annual rankings of over 200 different professions. Each profession is evaluated in 11 categories, taking into account not only the level of stress associated with the profession or salary level, but also development opportunities, working conditions, time spent away from home, the possibility of risking life or responsibility for others' health. Data for analysis are taken from the U.S. statistical office, trade unions or payroll surveys. This year's full ranking of 200 best professions will be published soon. In 2011, the Hotel Manager profession was ranked 96th in the middle of the rate."
4245,"I've been in this hotel for 14 days with the Ithaca travel agency and I don't recommend this hotel. I have not been em in such a bad hotel yet. Four stars I don't know where? The superior family room? ! ! ! ! ! with a seemingly ""sofa"" not sleeping ! It cannot be unfolded because the bed is simply broken and nails are still protruding. No mockery, what superior room? Better beds are in the shelter. This supposed piece of furniture does not meet the standards of furniture, nor the standards of safe use. Cleaning is poor. There are no beaches at 400m away. ( Playa de Ancla ) The stones themselves. Nearest beach 2 km ( bastia ) . Before the hour . 7 . 00 noise, from the window, because they brought goods to the kitchen or collected garbage, bottles. Unfortunately, I had a room on the east side. The noise from the door side, because they were putting out their hats and cutlery for breakfast (restaurant in the hotel courtyard). I do not recommend this hotel. Poor quality for a big price!"
4246,"Don't even think about going to see this man ! I remember 6 years ago, when he was still working at the Andrology Clinic at the Staszic Hospital, I sent another doctor (after having examined him at my place) a package with a deceased pregnancy some time ago (without telling the patient or the doctor, of course). Such a specialist is a specialist ! how good is he and how bad is he and how bad is he on someone else's account ! ( this inf . is first hand ) . And the worst part is that this man is now working next to Dr . A . A super doctor, a specialist ! ! !"
4247,"A very pleasant hotel, ideal for a few days' trip. Cozy rooms, peace and quiet, food in order, great location (by the sea). However, the rating is reduced by the service. None of the employees without exception for a few days stay said the first ""good morning"". ...no one smiled, no one asked how the stay was going. I had the impression that there were clerks working at the hotel, coming there only to take their shift and come back home as soon as possible. Having a room right next to the reception desk, I also witnessed a couple of misunderstandings that the receptionist always insisted on solving in favour of the hotel. In general, as a hotel guest, I did not feel welcome there."
4248,"At the hotel it's mega-cold, the radiators are barely warm, I have a preference for medium temperatures, the room was max 18 degrees. A shower with some kind of magic handle, you have to hold the handset constantly. In the room ugly smell of the staff does not even answer ""goodbye"" The waitress approaching me 2 x something she ate: D Generally not very well. . ."
4249,"After twelve months of 2011, European hotels saw a 3.1% increase in room utilisation compared to 2010, reaching 66.3%. The average room rate in euros was 99.86, up 2.6% on the previous year. The average room rate rose by 5.8% to €66.17, according to STR Global. The use and average room rate rose steadily in each month of 2011 with the exception of August, when there was a slight 1% decrease in ADR. However, August turned out to be a turning point for growth: although hotel performance was better in the following months, it did not grow as fast as in the first half of the year."
4251,"She got me to Mrs. Kuriata by order. The reason for my visit was the need to talk to a therapist who will help me to look at my problems with distance, from the side, advising with his knowledge and openness to people. The specific reason for this was a professional burnout, which for the last 2 years made me stop enjoying my life and reacted to my poor mental state at home. Mrs. Marzena is a really great therapist and a man . Thanks to her, she made me realize that she was stuck in my dreams, afraid of changes. She complained about her work and did not take any steps to change her life. I lacked the courage to change and self-confidence that I needed at work. I have been working in a different place for several months now and I am happy that she dared to change her life. Stress, frustration, anxiety, and anxiety disappeared. To a large extent I owe it to Mrs. Kurata, whose wisdom and understanding gave me wings and made me realize that life is too short to waste it out of fear of change. Thank you, Mrs. Marzeno!"
4252,"Two years ago I was with Dr. Czerner. . The doctor stated that it is too late in my situation for treatment (surgery), because in Poland ligaments are not reconstructed (he said so without ordering additional examinations, e.g. CT, MRI). At the moment I am after Arthroscopy. The real cause of my ailments was shown by the results of CT, MRI and stress X-ray examinations, to which another doctor sent me. . . . .I don't recommend. . . . .years of experience can sometimes be fatal. . ."
4253,"The visit to your doctor was my first visit to a gynaecological specialist. She did not explain to me many things that interested me. The next visit, which lasted about 10 minutes, could have been called a ""complete oil"". I do not recommend it. Fortunately, she found a gynaecologist whom I trust. Greetings"
4254,"I sincerely recommend Mrs. Ela. Last year, she volunteered to see her. . . I liked that Mrs. Ela listened to me and put together a diet exactly as she wanted m . At the beginning she told me that if I get recipes without finesse and taste, I can't stand this diet for long. She was afraid that in order to lose weight I would have to eat steamed vegetables with rice. . . Instead, I would get an interesting menu full of hors d'oeuvres and taste. I managed to lose weight and improve my health. Your ele is a nice, competent person who can motivate you. If you want to lose weight and at the same time eat tasty dishes that suit your taste, I recommend Mrs. Ela! Karolina"
4255,"The hotel itself is ok, it has what it takes and it is clean, the hotel in a total remote area, to the nearest shop 50 minutes walk by the side of a winding road (no sidewalk!) so in the evening there is even nowhere to go because you can risk your life. . . The food is terrible really. . I love Greece and she was on a dozen or so islands so I have a comparison but she has never seen anything so terrible in Greece and she did not eat m ! I don't know if it's because of the economy or the lack of skills of the cook, but the bottom line is total. . . After all, Greek cuisine is delicious and there are some strange sauces, hard fatty meat, even a Greek salad was without any fetish about olives! ! ! ! but once there was a salad with - attention. . . . .chopped lettuce + canned corn + vinegar! ! And for dessert, every other day, every other day, a diluted chocolate pudding. . . . .embarrassment. . . The hotel is full of Romanians and Bulgarians who couldn't behave themselves, after the night, they played loud music, peed and ran. . . . .it was supposed to be an oasis of peace in this hotel. . . . .no way. . . . .especially since the main road around the island runs just below the hotel/pool. . . . . . . .day and night noise. . . . . Well, no, I don't really recommend it."
4256,"I'm a resident of a neighboring municipality. In June 2014, together with friends, we visited this place. The usual trip to dinner . In an empty room outside of us (2 couples with a total of three children) was another couple. Waiting time for the waiter 20 minutes. . . Waiting time for simple dishes ordered by us 50 minutes . . . Soups served with the second course . . . Cool meals, without words, without anything to praise them. . . Children's menu - does not exist . . . 5 * for this facility, it's a gloomy joke, and it's certainly a mockery of restaurant clients and hotel guests. For the location and appearance of the hotel itself you can give 5 *, for the kitchen and service 1 *. . . I don't recommend it to anyone and I won't come back."
4257,"Hello Hotel is clean nice service very good location. We had a room on the first floor and it was enough for 3 people, at the reception desk very nice and will always show what and where. Breakfast is very weak here no fruit and vegetables like cucumber tomatoes are missing. But in general, the hotel recommends"
4258,"Cracow beautiful but hotel massacre . The service wasn't nice all there dear to this ridiculous canteen on the ice rink you could kill yourself. . . And the swimming pool so much chlorine that there was nothing to breathe. . . The rooms lack words. . . . . . .we were afraid to bathe in the bathroom from the shower. . . And also TV 5 channels, 2 of them in Polish: ( I do NOT recommend! ! !"
4259,"I've been treating infertility for several years. I have already been through two infertility clinics, many doctors and several times in vitro. The Doctor came to me by accident. It was the first time she met me to start the visit with such a detailed interview. Then a series of tests . And here my surprise. Interpretation of the results and it turned out that there are several abnormalities in me, about which no one has previously advised me. A proposal for treatment and action . Each visit to the doctor lasts at least half an hour . It is a time filled with research, conversation, planning of next actions, etc . . It is a real doctor. I have not managed to get the desired pregnancy, but I know that the doctor is not a miracle worker. After many years of experience with doctors, they no longer expect a miracle, only an approach to me as a man and not a razor to make money. This is how I assess the visits to Dr. Roczniok. I recommend it with a clear conscience."
4261,"""We have developed sensors to determine the A - beta peptide and protein of the S 100 B family. There are scientific data which indicate that the presence of this protein is indicative of the development of Alzheimer's disease. We have not stopped there, we will look for more markers and develop sensors to determine them. This research must be closely connected with medical institutions, because the analysis of the blood of patients affected by the disease and the constant search for reasons that lead to it will give us a tool in the form of new markers"" - emphasized prof . Radecka emphasized . ""If we managed to develop such a test and everything is on the right track, it would be a very helpful tool for close Alzheimer's patients. There is a lot of expectation on their part, the families of patients live in anxiety or really, + if the loved one is affected by this disease, will such a sentence await me too? + . It is not so unambiguous"" - emphasized prof . Radecka emphasized."
4262,"I am, so far, very pleased to see your doctor. I had been with 2 other doctors before with the results, which later turned out to be wrong; and only Mr. Grzegorz immediately realized that most likely these results are a laboratory error: which of course was later confirmed. Additionally, I can add that Mr. Grzegorz immediately aroused my sympathy, he is nice, friendly and, what is most important for me, concrete, factual and knows his work. After 2 previous visits to 2 other doctors she was confused in her head and from your doctor's office she came out satisfied and knew where I stand. These tips on the internet are also very good because she didn't have to drive 70 kilometers with the results; and of course this is not only about money, but also about time, which is so lacking recently. With a clear conscience I can recommend this doctor to anyone."
4264,"Unfortunately, I do not agree with the positive opinions about prof . At the beginning, she also perceived him as such. Before the first ablation of our son, we hoped that we would be in good hands. A year after the first ablation it turned out that there was no success. I am frightened by the lack of interest in the patient after the ablation! Mr. prof . he avoided us like a fire. Finally, he proposed a second ablation, which he was to perform with Dr. Baszko. Unfortunately, he planned a vacation at that time and unsuccessful procedure was performed by another young doctor. Today the son is in two unsuccessful ablutions at prof . He is on heart medication and nobody gives him hope for a normal life! The patient who does not promise to be successful for the professor is ignored. However, I am grateful for the support of Dr. Rzeźnik - Bieniaszewska !"
4265,"Dr Jacek Polewiak arrived on time for his appointment online. After hearing my report on the ailment and reading the presented documentation he confirmed the diagnosis of the doctor performing ultrasound. For his part, he presented a written consultation containing a suggestion of pharmacological treatment addressed to the GP."
4266,"""This study has in a way revolutionized ophthalmology - it allows to obtain knowledge about the structure of the retina in the patient, its cross-section. Previously, an ophthalmologist could see the bottom of the eye using a sight glass (ophthalmoscope - PAP note), seeing only the surface of the retina, without the possibility of analyzing deeper layers"" - indicated prof . Grzybowski . Now, thanks to OCT, it is possible to see exactly what the structure of nervous tissue looks like. Thanks to a very large magnification, the study shows various types of abnormalities, also at the cellular level. Magnetic resonance imaging does not give such accuracy. To perform the examination with an ophthalmoscope or OCT, there can be no opaque cornea or cataract. Then it is possible to have an ultrasound, which, however, does not have the same accuracy as OCT - explained the ophthalmologist."
4267,"Until 10 years ago, scientists knew nothing about the existence of knots. ""Since the subject is still quite fresh, until now we do not know how and why they form. We also don't know if a node on a protein gives it a specific function. This is a question which I would like to answer very much"" - emphasized Dr. Sułkowska. If we make a knot on the laces, it is so that the shoe will stick to our leg. When we climb, we tie a knot so that the rope holds us. We tie up the package so that what is in it remains safe. ""Usually the knots have a function. However, it is still unknown what is the function of knots on proteins. We don't know why biology has worked so hard to create such a complicated structure,"" said the PAP caller."
4268,"Unfortunately, I share all the negative opinions about the Doctor. Due to the lack of free terms for other specialists, it was the second time that I found Mrs. Doctor. The second time, unfortunately, she was very disappointed. My little child entered the office with a smile and came out with a scream, the Doctor unfortunately does not show any approach to children, did not change a word with the child, the examination was forced on the child by force, and it was enough only to talk to the toddler, who is a cheerful child every day and likes to be examined. Throughout the whole visit the doctor introduces strange comments that are out of place, she had the impression that she is not at all interested in what she does. I advise against visiting this doctor, especially with children, because it is a pity to expose them to such unnecessary stress. For the check-up visit of course I made an appointment with another specialist."
4269,"I was asked to pay 18 euros for a 5-year-old child when I checked in - after not having had a pleasant exchange of views (I did not want to agree to the payment, the receptionist suggested that I sleep in the lobby), the manager was asked and he ""graciously"" agreed to 10 euros. I do not like children there so I strongly advise against it. The room was not even ventilated for a long time. Breakfast is cereal with milk, sausages, sausage and bacon - this is literally the whole breakfast menu, probably with this surcharge they meant this breakfast, but my child did not eat what they served for even 1 euro, the hotel is located a little bit far away from the city, although to the city goes quickly (because of the hill), but the return is a torment, especially that it is very steep, and it takes ok . 20 minutes. The only advantage is the proximity of Loro Park, but there are many other hotels in the area where children are accepted. . . . I strongly advise against it and never again. . Welcome. Upon check was requested from me 18 euro fee for 5 year old child - after a row exchange of words , ( did not want to agree to a payment to you from the front desk offered me to sleep in the lobby ) unless the manager and asked that "" graciously "" agreed to a 10 euros . They do not like kids so there definitely advise against . Terrible stench in the room did not help as long airing .

The only plus is the proximity to Loro Park , but there is a multitude of other hotels which accept children . . . . definitely not recommend and never more . ."
4270,"We couldn't sleep because of air conditioning failures, only after 3 nights they changed our room. The whole program of the hotel was adapted to the children, as if they were going on vacation alone. About All inclusive I can only say that I would prefer to take cheap wine with me from Poland as if I knew what we would find there. Hotel for the plebeians from England, who accounted for 90% of the guests (anointed, dressed like a Pole going fishing; p) . These 3800 in the season should probably be the price for a 5-person family."

From the beginning of the year to the end of April, international tourists spent 57.9 billion USD on tourism-related goods and services. President Obama wanted the National Travel and Tourism Strategy to reach US$250 billion by 2021.

4274,"""We light up a certain part of the epidermis with diodes. An electromagnetic wave - which is light - passes through tissues and we examine its reflected signal. On the basis of this analysis we are able to estimate some vital parameters of the human body - not only heart rate, blood pressure, but also blood glucose level"" - explained Szczepaniak. He also added that the measurement methodology is based on the Lambert-Beer law, which assumes that both the amount of energy absorbed and dispersed by a given type of molecule depends directly on its concentration in a given environment. ""So the properties of light that has passed through tissue are dependent on blood sugar levels,"" he explained. He ensured that his team carefully selected the wavelengths of the glucose molecules that circulate in the human body, so that the iSULIN system is able to determine its level with sufficient precision. The measuring device is small - it is the size of a wristwatch which is connected to a smartphone via Bluetooth. The user should install a student-designed application on the smartphone. This application is supposed to help the patient take care of his balanced diet and enable contact with medical personnel. Students have already prepared a working prototype of the device, but before the system can be launched on the market, many tests leading to its final certification are needed. However, for the time being, as they say, there are no such devices on sale yet."

4276,"It's like Tefal, and China anyway. Water smells of plastic, despite repeated cooking and washing. I still have to try the patent with the instructions on boiling water with some soda. There is no transparent scale - you don't know where the minimum is and the maximum is some element in the middle of the sieve. There is no light signal - useful in noisy environment. However, an old kettle (plastic, not stainless steel) did not have it. When pouring water, you have to hold the flap in the other hand or put it away - there is no hinge, only it takes off completely. The flip heats up, so it's hard to hold it in your hand if you want to add another flip after using up all the water (the healing water). Something is leaking almost from the news."
4277,"Finally, the hotel where you are a guest, not a customer. Perfect approach of Employees to their duties. Everything is done with a smile and no problem at all. Very good, varied meals, fresh products. Possibility to park your bikes in an underground hotel car park. Hotel ideal for business stays - close to the center and you can work in a very pleasant environment. But also for a holiday stay is great; spa, wellness, beach for children available from the hotel, playground, playground, playroom (in holiday animation) for older PlayStation consoles. The infrastructure around the hotel is very extensive. I recommend like most of the rooms with a view of the lake - very pleasant evenings and mornings. Very clean. If someone likes silence, trains from the other side can be a bit irritating - it did not bother us at all, considering the advantages. From small remarks or hints to the managers; - in the summer season, a shower/shower by the beach would be a convenience for parents with children playing in the sand, - books in the library about horror:) who packed them in wrapping paper (interesting items, but you have to go through all the books to discover what the mysterious packages are hiding) . To sum it up: you can safely come in the dark."

4280,"I do not recommend this hotel to anyone we went on holiday for a few days with a child we chose the apartment on the top floor in the three star part. The room was spacious, but so much bath with hydromassage, but what turned out to be not working. Apart from the fact that we reported of course no one came to fix it, but the best part is that after 8pm there was no water to drip. Paranoia in the morning we asked for a change of room, and it turned out that there was no such option. One squeeze is very good food, but wait for the drama table to be released. And in the apartment coffee machine is probably to make up for the lack of water we had to be 5 days but after the first day we thanked. Of course, the money doesn't want to come back."
4282,"I do not recommend the products of this manufacturer, the workmanship is not as good as any manufactory.

The complaint was accepted, but after 3 weeks and received new elements (reported damaged), but not matching the other furniture - holes for pegs were drilled with a spacing of about . 1 cm different from those purchased earlier! ! ! I do NOT RECOMMEND, unless instead of twisting and using the furniture, you want to twist and turn the furniture all your life. In addition, all cuts of furniture are uneven and the edges are bent in many places. As if you were looking at this furniture with a really critical eye, then a good one of them was just a key and screws. . ."
4283,"The hotel did not show its best side. Neglected and uncleaned rooms need renovating. The restaurant has a decent taste, but the prices are not adequate to quality. She was m, she checked m - I will not come back here anymore."
4284,"bladder inflammation - the doctor asked me about everything but he prescribed me a furagin despite the fact that I had been taking it for 4 days and nothing helped - and the prescription was so illegible and underlined that in two pharmacies I was refused it, only in the third one, after calling the clinic, the pharmacist gave me a furagin (which of course is without a prescription) because in the clinic she received information from the doctor that nothing on the card except the furagin was written. I think the routine got to the doctor and 150 PLN is definitely too expensive for such service."

4286,"In short: I feel like to throw this case out the window and buy a worthy successor to my previous Antec P193 V3. Advantages : - Large and easily accessible power button Minus : - sheet metal thinner than canned - with a bit of inattention the door can be broken with hands - sharp edges in the middle e.g. . at drive baskets, power supply handle - drive baskets are 2 . Of course, they can not be replaced or mounted interchangeably - the interior is small and tight: to mount my Radek 7970 I had to take out 1 basket of disks. It is possible that after mounting the graphics the basket would fit back, but I prefer not to try not to accidentally kill the card. - SSD baskets solved badly - fortunately I did not have to use, I have SSD on the board. - The ODD baskets seem to have a proprietary snap-in system that doesn't work - when you press harder on the front, the snap-in system lets go and the drive slides into the case. So you have to screw it in anyway - HDDs also have their own innovative way of mounting. So what if, after mounting the drive, the head movements move to the housing and cause vibrations and echoes around the housing. - The whole front panel and the top of the enclosure made of cheesy plastic - I had the impression that it would fall apart in my hands."
4287,"My boyfriend and I went on our first trip together in August 2010. They decided to go to Athens and recommended us Dorian Inn Hotel; we never had any problems at the hotel, the room was clean, we had air conditioning and a nice terrace where we could enjoy the sun. The swimming pool on the roof was small but good enough to relax a bit, in the end we were there to explore the city and not sit by the pool. I wouldn't recommend eating in the restaurant, she ordered a m salad and that was what she got m - lettuce, I couldn't find the goat cheese or dried tomatoes as described in the menu. The neighborhood is not too safe, but my boyfriend and I didn't care about it, we went out a few times in the evening and never had any problems with anyone. The staff at the hotel was really friendly and our room was cleaned every day (don't forget to put the card ""please clean the room"" on the door). We had a great time in Athens and I recommend this hotel to everyone."
4288,"He's a very nice doctor, but despite all the sympathy, I won't go to him anymore. It had a hole between the top 4 and 5, your doctor was recommended by a colleague. It turned out that I can come to the visit even on the same day, which surprised me. Within 30 minutes Mr. Doctor put 2 seals on me and deleted 200 PLN. From the very beginning she felt that something was wrong because it was as if they were bothering me. She went to me a second time, but the doctor said that everything was fine. Every now and then my teeth ached, but after a year they started to be sensitive to heat and cold. She went to another dentist and it turned out that both fillings were put on too shallow, moreover there was a lot of caries underneath them, and that means that during the sealing the doctor did not properly clean my teeth from caries. 5 had to be re-drilled again from the very beginning and 4 were only suitable for root canal treatment. . . I personally do not recommend, although the doctor is nice: )"
4289,"I've been a patient of Dr. Gavrísia for many years. A very good doctor. A great expert in endocrinology . A decent and sensitive man. People like Dr. Gavrísia should be honored in the hospital and be modeled on other doctors. She'd like to be seen more often by such doctors. If others behaved at least 50% like that, there wouldn't be such bad opinions about the health service. Bravo, Doctor! ! ! ! !"
4291,"A hotel could compete with hotels in the Arab countries as somebody noticed is big, with great splendor and a bit of mixed styles which consequently causes a lack of style, huge corridors, rooms are enough, bathrooms very modest and underdeveloped in details for a 4 star hotel unthinkable, red restaurant typical canteen, queues for food, medium selection in the Arabic countries much larger, old Polish restaurant was supposed to resemble the highlander style, with which it completely passes, green restaurant quality will last in relation to the price of the massacre! ! ! I do not recommend . Another topic is a recurring mistake from previous hotels is that someone has already pointed out that there is a lack of acoustic insulation. Both the doors and the walls do not isolate noise or louder conversations from the neighboring rooms can be heard most in the evening. The prices in the whole building in relation to quality are very high - if the prices are already high, the quality must be very high, impeccable, perfect. And something personally drew my attention to something (marketing, administration, etc.) shows a lack of communication and lack of developed standards of customer service - it seems that the employees are for punishment, and the customer is not there and it is nice as if he was not there, after a 4-day stay I had the impression that it is not the hotel for the customer but the customer for the hotel - which is absurd nowadays - the socialist approach has long since ended - a clear failure of this hotel. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Gołębiewscy, if you do not listen to your customers and take care of the level of service, but also design according to global standards, the growing competition will beat you in the blink of an eye. . . . . .I and my company will no longer use your services. I definitely prefer to go to Turkey, Tunisia or Egypt and there this climate I will swallow in Poland not. . . ."
4292,"Hotel misunderstanding . Absolutely does not deserve 3 stars . Claustrophobic rooms with even smaller windows, no air conditioning. A miniature bathroom with a tiny sink . No shampoo, no shower liquid - unless you like to use such an unknown origin from a collective container. The size of a shower enclosure is such that if you have a size greater than 38, you will neither rotate nor bend. A person of a larger size will also have a problem to fit on the toilet between the wall and the shower enclosure. The wifi of the pre-dawn speed . Rooms are messy, dirty . The night light overhead is a naked bulb covered with a piece of sheet metal . There's only one contact in the room - if you want to connect the computer and charger to the phone, you have to turn off the pre-domestic TV, but be careful - this only contact is far from the bed and table. A very poor breakfast with bad sausage. Location at a gas station and a shopping mall, but far from the center. No, no and once again not."
4294,"Here's an example of how you shouldn't run a lab. I'm talking in particular about the beginning of programming because I was in contact with this case (not directly). A guy can do brilliantly with people who are supposed to learn it. He doesn't give a shit what's going on at the lecture because people who don't know the basics of C ask the programs that should appear after the 4th lecture and then it's only worse. Personally, it is no wonder that people who have Infe 1 or something like it do not learn to program because to do so, they would have to go through an accelerated course. Therefore, the history of delegating tasks to others is probably common with him. In the case of this gentleman, he is there to help if someone wants to get through it stress-free: )"

In terms of average concentrations (from all measuring stations) of PM 2 , 5 and benzopyrene our country is in the infamous top of Europe - he noted . He also added that in recent years Poland has seen a small but steady decrease in total national PM 2,5 emissions. According to the report, nitrogen dioxide pollution in Poland is the cause of 1.6 thousand premature deaths. In this respect, among 40 European countries, Poland is in 7th place: behind Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium."
4296,"One CT scanner operates at 250 MHz, the other at 1 GHz - it uses 4 times higher magnetic field and has 16 times higher sensitivity. These are tomographs for biomedical applications, for the time being laboratory - for tests on small mammals. They work faster than currently used devices of this type. They are able to measure objects larger than 2 cm, even up to 5 cm . This is an important change, because it is possible to follow the development of cancer also in mature mammals. They use the EPR techniques of electron paramedical resonance. The technology concerns free radicals, in simplification particles having an odd number of electrons forming individual bonds between individual molecules. The study is to show where the cancer is located, even if it is not yet visible. Although there are no anatomical changes, the measurement of oxygen concentration will help the doctor to indicate the cancer in the selected organ. During this examination you can start treatment and use radiation therapy to destroy the tumor."
4297,"A very concrete and professional visit. The doctor answers all the questions in a way that makes it easier to understand the problem, she herself pays attention to certain things, does not hurry, devotes as much time as the patient needs. Very carefully conducted examination. I recommend the doctor to all women."
4298,"The Head of the Ministry of Health stressed in his speech that one of the priorities and challenges facing dentistry is to promote pro-health habits in society. ""No preventive measures will be properly applied if we do not ensure effective health promotion in advance. However, in order for this to be effective, it is necessary to make the society aware of this, to ensure that it has adequate knowledge of health protection"" - pointed out Radziwiłł . He expressed his satisfaction that the Congress provides all practicing dentists with an opportunity to exchange experiences and knowledge and to emphasize the role of education. ""We are aware of what is also confirmed by research that oral health is extremely important for the health of the whole body. We know that in addition to the diagnosis and treatment itself, prevention and preventive measures are also very important"" - noted the Minister of Health."
4300,"I strongly advise against visiting this doctor - at least at the LIM facility. That's where the doctor takes the patients to the LIM facility, every 5 minutes. At such a rate, there is no question of a proper examination, getting acquainted with the test results and any reasonable advice at all. My problem is quite complicated, but unfortunately, the doctor did not have time for a thorough interview or for reading the test results. He was spraying and despite being able to check his medical history, he decided that there was no time for this. This was my first and last visit to this doctor."
4301,"Evaluation: I highly recommend the lecture was 100% understandable and explained well how to do the task. To get a pass, you have to write 2 circles, you have to have 20 / 40 to get a pass for the problems none."
4302,"Part of this research is part of the project ""Technology Transfer to Industry"". Their results will be able to be used by specific companies in the region from different industries, as the research is carried out on their behalf. Bialystok University of Technology has signed contracts with these companies. The companies are to receive ready-made, innovative solutions and will implement them. This is to increase their competitiveness. It is also about establishing closer and long-term cooperation between the university and industry. The project includes work on eight innovations in areas such as: construction, production of agricultural machinery, water and sewage management or renewable energy sources. Researchers are working, among others, on a robot which will help to monitor underground water and sewage systems without the need for excavation. They will also design a technological line for the production of continuous silicate façade tiles. New, ecological solutions related to the use of asphalt granulate in road construction are also to be developed."
4303,"Overall, the cot looks nice. The look and design are undoubtedly advantages. Unfortunately, the quality of materials leaves much to be desired: - The poor quality of the fibreboard in the drawer, which breaks when the wheels are screwed in; barriers made of plywood, which breaks when screwing in the side railings, - Velcro as an idea for closing the drawer flap does not work at all (attached 2 Velcro fasteners are glued to the upper edges of the drawer) and when you try to open the Velcro fasteners peel off the edge of the drawer - easy to remove 2 side rungs which is convenient for parents but can be dangerous for the child. The only truly wooden elements are the rungs of the side railings. The cot will not work at all if someone is planning it for more than one child. After disassembling when trying to twist the product the elements are unfortunately very loose which makes the cot completely unstable. In my opinion it is better to pay a little more for a better quality product."
4304,"For a week no one has cleaned our hotel room, no one has changed the towels. The cleaning is limited to taking the trash. There's a mushroom in the bathroom and a terrible smell of sewage. It happened that there was no hot water from the shower. Wi - fi paid. The hotel billiards are also paid for, which was funny because the tips of the sticks are so wiped that the curves have no chalk to rub off, or even a triangle to set the balls, and 1 ball is missing: The hotel is also a place where you can get a drink, which was very funny because the ends of the sticks are so wiped that they have no chalk to rub on, not even a triangle to set up the balls, and 1 ball is missing:) At the bar there is a small selection of alcohols, for a ""normal"" drink you can't count. And finally the food . . . tragedy . It was even spoiled, not fresh. Every day practically the same. Very low quality products. Toasted bread only, sometimes plain white. No tea, possibly fruit or some herbs or mint. Fruit is missing. Powder juices. Coffee from the machine . Dirty dishes, not cooked. You better pay a little extra and take all inclusive in a normal hotel. I definitely do NOT recommend this! For the mess, stench and terrible food. The only positive thing is the service - very nice, only few people speak English."
4305,"There are many attractions in the hotel, but they do not work or are neglected. There is no air conditioning in the rooms. The balcony doors do not close. Service swears at guests. The hotel is not maintained in any way. The roof leaks and water flows down the walls. There is a scent of GRZYB in the whole hotel. Generally I do not recommend ."
4306,"I strongly advise against: everything has a noisy name, under which there is kitsch and sloppy, in the room dirty, renovation behind the wall at 7pm on Saturday, that the wall is shaking, good meals, but the ladies serving no longer necessarily nice, for example. The cake that ants walk on and waitress discreetly kill them. I will not come here anymore."
4307,"I'm disappointed to see Dr. Połaccio in Gamet. . . It was my first and last visit. . . . . It lasted 10 minutes and neither I nor my husband was examined. . . . . As soon as the doctor found out where my husband works, he immediately offered us in vitro, he said that we meet all the conditions and then the husband asked if we have no chance of getting naturally pregnant, he said that the wife may already be pregnant because they brought us all the tests that the doctor looked at and said that everything is okay, but if we want to qualify for in vitro, unless we have time, we can wait another year. . . Is this the way to approach the case. . . I don't think that's the way, dear Dr. Dr. Bishop. . . I know it's your money! ! ! But this approach to the patient is out of place. . . I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
4308,"It follows that only a small number of cells play an important role in cancer growth and metastasis formation. They are probably responsible for the patient's illness and death. Therefore it is not necessary to destroy the whole tumour to neutralize the cancer. Conversely, it is even possible to significantly reduce the size of the tumour, which is often the case during treatment, and the disease will return anyway if the cells with the greatest ability to proliferate are not eliminated. According to Stokłos, the same is true for chronic myelogenous leukaemia, which is caused by a single mutation, the so-called BCR tyrosine kinase - ABL. It is crucial for the development of this disease. It is formed in the bone marrow stem cells, which are the cells from which all other cells can be formed."
4309,"There should be a 50% discount on rooms on the street side with a warning "" only for desperate people "" . It is because of the 24-hour sound ads ""disko club"" broadcast from a driving car even after 22:00 - something that is legally prohibited elsewhere in the country and not here. There is a bedside lamp in the room next to the bed, but it cannot be used because the cable is too short and does not reach the nearest socket."
4311,"Ibis standard rooms - no fireworks, but clean. Very nice lobby and dining room, worse with service, on a Saturday morning breakfast was definitely not enough people to serve so many guests, every now and then something was missing, a queue to the coffee machine (the second spoiled), etc. A good starting point for exploring the center of Lodz."
4312,"Upon arrival, we were told to wait until the hotel day begins - understandable. After the start of the day, the staff thought us saying that the rooms will be ready in 15, 30 minutes. After 2 hours of waiting, the staff said that the rooms would not be ready. The alternative were rooms significantly deviating from the standard booked earlier (rooms without bathrooms!). The hotel simply fooled us. We were not apologized, the staff was rude and unhelpful and did not speak English. I strongly advise against using this hotel."
4313,"I'm also sorry to say that I was very disappointed with this doctor. In December, a few days of terrible stomach pains started in my place. Encouraged by the opinions of my friends, I decided to have a gastroscopy examination with Dr . Potatoes. At the beginning, Dr . made a positive impression on me, nice, elegant, etc . He detected my gallbladder problems with the echinocococcosis and single Candida colonies. He ordered an ultrasound to examine the faeces for yeast and lamb, etc . I thought somebody would finally take care of me professionally. The ultrasound only showed traces of sand in the gallbladder, the faecal examination showed no parasites or fungi. After a month of waiting for another consultation, I was happy to see the results of the examination, and I was happy to see Dr. Brown in the office. He thought that the beginning of the treatment would finally be only better. The doctor looked at the results and found that he didn't expect such a ""bad"" result of the gallbladder ultrasound that there are ""deposits"" and the walls of the gallbladder are ""bold"", which was not in the description of the doctor who gave me this ultrasound. He said that we will have to see each other in 3 months' time, repeat the gastroscopy if the gallbladder does not heal, can we have surgery? I was frightened by the news and verbal doubts he commented with words that I should ""take a handful and take medicines"" after which he prescribed me antibiotics for Candide parasites that none of the tests detected and masses of other shields etc . In the pharmacy he left 'em 650 zloty for a 3-month treatment, went out with a big net and the lady in the pharmacy asked if she wants an invoice for a disability group? hehe ( I am 26 years old ) : ) Every day I was supposed to take 15 different tablets + 6 painkillers in case of ailments. I don't have to add that on the 3rd day of taking the medicines I landed in the E.R. on Kopernika Street. I had terrible abdominal pain, dizziness, diarrhea and vomiting, I could not eat anything at all. I was scared and sure that it was not side effects but that my ""gallbladderitis took on the character of acute inflammation"". Really, the treatment from Dr. Potato is not worth the nerves. Maybe it helps people with minor problems like curing helicobacter with reflux. . . . .but he approached my case very unprofessionally and didn't get to know me at all by insinuating chronic gastroenteritis, yeast and parasites. To sum up, I do NOT recommend it at all! ! ! ! ! ! Think twice before you decide to see this doctor. Greetings to Peter"
4314,"Unfortunately, you can't control it, i.e. refrain from organizing integration events if there are other guests or silence them in time. The whole rules of the night silence 22 - 6 is a linden tree; similarly, it is stated that the reception desk is the guests' guardian. For a long time, Mr. Carter could not make a decision to change my room because he was afraid of his superiors' reasons. At the same time, the manager of corporate events lacks the ability to cope with such a situation if it already happens: instead of a deal and offer something (anything) they go for a short while. WALTER ! ! ! ( unless you like disco polo after midnight ... ) . By the way, the rooms are basically clean but the object itself is bland. And with this Italian-Mediterranean cuisine, I think you've gone. . ."
4315,"I don't know if you're satisfied with this doctor, but I'll describe my situation. A year ago the kindergarten started and my croka started going to the kindergarten in December, she started to get high because it was over 39 degrees and she called my doctor to see what was going on because she also got me to P . Stasiuka then I already had a number came to him he said that there is an infection he listened to her exactly bronchitis was not, he did not prescribe anything and then said to give painkillers and fevers, ok we gave it but it was even worse coughing rhinitis weakening did not eat anything 2 weeks so I dragged with this doctor. When I was in the hospital, he listened again and sent us nothing for a blood test, and then it turned out that the child has (I don't remember if it was too much or too little) the doctor got scared and gave us a referral to the hospital because he thought it was something with a female babe, We in starch to the doctor in Lvivska I got off 6 hours they were doing tests again, the young doctor took the phone and when she heard these noises she will no longer bronchially bronze but lungs. . . . . . .were sick. . . . .if you think that P. . . Stasiuk who is a specialist in bronchi and lungs who didn't listen to the murmurs and did what he did ok then go to him. . . . .I've already made these visits to him, and I've made the theory of every subject that he's making a different visit - I'm done!"
4316,"The pictures here are beautiful, in fact a failure. My photos don't look like that. Beach with algae, ugly, umbrellas as if they were about to fall apart. We drove us to the beaches to the Golden Sands, you can get a taxi or bus, about 10 km, taxi 10 - 20 leva depends on the driver. By bus 1 , 8 leva . The food was monotonous, there was no menu for the children, the families complained, I was with a friend and in the last days we ate only fruit, except that you have to go either immediately or feel the moment when they add up and then ; ) As far as the rooms are concerned, cleanliness and everything related to it is very good. Nevertheless, the holidays were successful, but thanks to the people who were there, we had a successful group scattered from Pomerania through Warsaw, Kielce to Katowice. Greetings to all: )"
4318,"we just came back from a stay on kavos hotel island beach resort vacation that I will not forget for the rest of my life the road to the hotel is terrible hotel is located at the end of the world without any signs of access to it parking for one car when we checked in. the staff at the so-called reception desk was hopelessly trying to trick us into thinking that we had one room for three and the documents said there was one separate room and one double room we got couldn't say that it looked like it was a room. in it two beds, a wardrobe table in which we didn't keep things because it was too small and there were no phone hangers and no TV in the bathroom, no soap, and the towels were changed once a week to the sea very close but no one was there. I want to take pictures of the hotel that were taken twenty years ago, because nothing like the breakfast we got there was made up of two toasts and a package so the rest could be bought in a lousy mini bar I'd call it. a cheap motel than the hotel's service from eleven o'clock at night very loud music until six o'clock in the morning screaming at the hotel last day we had a flight home at one o'clock at night, so we asked at the reception desk if it was possible to leave the luggage and but it turned out that you said we knew her too late, and unfortunately there is no room, but there is a room for us in another hotel where we can leave our luggage and take a shower normally ten euros but we had to pay. Twenty is a mockery, I guess if we didn't have a rental car, I'd cry and walk home. I thought it wasn't really happening, and if somebody tells me it's nice in the kavos, I can't believe it if it's not. Before each trip we read reviews and there were many good reviews so we chose this hotel heh besides all the beaches are hopeless rocky look like after the tsunami nobody cares what I can suffer for those going to Greece I recommend : sidari, beach issos, smoking sisi, old and new fort and trips: calypso star and paxos antipaxos."
4319,"the girls, let's think about whether we want to be treated well or worry about your doctor's behavior and talking the same thing. I WILL BE AWARE TO THERE, and I Say HERE, I HAVE NO OPINION ON THIS THEME I AM AWARE TO read the important negative opinion of every human being, but I HAVE NOT AWARE TO THERE WHAT IS NOT so IN OUR ORGANISATIONS, it IS THERE TO BE FOUND AND INCLUDES THAT ANY OF OUR OURSHOUGHERS HAVE LIKELY PROBLEMS FOR THESE TABLES AND PENDLARS are LIKELY AND YOU CAN'T HAVE TO LOOK. I know a few girls who are delighted with it and don't bother talking, but they are well treated and feel better and look better so I don't know but one thing is for sure there are no good doctors here so they can choose one and they are worse so there is no need to insult him but to change the cure and everyone will go where they think is right. AND THINK ABOUT WHY HE HAS THE QUEUES WHEN HE'S SO BAD? I'M ."
4321,"A week ago, I had a visit to my medicine. Przemyslaw Kosiński . It was a service between 11-14 tc with risk assessment in Multi Med on Polna Street . The cost of the visit was 300 PLN . I do not want to assess the professionalism of the doctor, it seems to me that the examination was done correctly, and given the competence of the drug. Przemysław and very good equipment on which he works I think that this is what happened. However, I have reservations about the time that the doctor devoted to my person. With the watch in hand it was 10 minutes. From the very beginning the doctor was clearly in a hurry. He spoke very quickly, quickly made an ultrasound and very quickly made the documentation. He didn't give me much chance to ask all the questions I had, and by hurrying, he created a nervous atmosphere in which I could hardly think. During the examination, she asked me if I could see the sex of the child (the people who recommended me to the clinic said that it was already possible in some small way). but the doctor commented on my question that I should be more interested in a child's heart than in gender. At the end, he said goodbye twice, so that we could leave. Visiting the doctor. Przemysław Kosiński did not meet all my expectations. The most important thing for me is the hope that through haste nothing was overlooked."
4322,"leaving with friends in September 2017 . The first impression is not bad. The reception looks quite encouraging. At the entrance we were greeted by two nice girls. They asked us in English which country we are from, and then handed us the registration cards to fill in. The room was small, you could say that the look of the room was the same as the pictures. Unfortunately the bathrooms. . . Tragedy! The hotel is definitely not opened last year. The bathrooms are 10 years old. They're not exactly cleaned either. On the taps, the old curtain is on the shower. We bought paper towels and chemicals in the nearest shop (about 2km from the hotel) and for a good day we tried to get a good look at the bathrooms so we could use them normally. The cistern in the toilet was broken all the time. I won't say - after reporting it at the reception, somebody came and repaired it, but one day, in turn, we simply repaired it ourselves. The room was cleaned every other day (washing the floor with a mop), towels for the whole stay (7 days) changed 2 or 3 times. Interestingly, despite leaving the towels on the floor, they were not changed, but hung back on the hanger. Fortunately, we had our towels with us: ) The pool was painted with a substance that colours the swimsuit. Cleaned daily. Meals served under the shelter . The whole mass of wasps . . The food was quite monotonous, you could find something for yourself - albeit a small choice. Nice and friendly service, greetings to the bartenders and the minibus driver. Positive aspect of stay : ) The hotel is located on a hill, all over the place. Luckily, there is a minibus mentioned earlier, which will take you to the beaches and to the city (at the reception desk, a schedule of when, where and at what times it runs). You have to sign up earlier at the reception, because if there are a lot of people who are willing, the priority is given to those signed up. In general, I think the stay is quite positive - mainly due to the weather and views of zakynthos. I would like to return there - unfortunately not to the hotel Zakynthos."
4323,"We have chosen this hotel again for the night before leaving for the airport. Nice and quick service by the reception staff. Fast transport from the airport - after telephone call to the reception and to the airport - after report at the reception, no extra charge. Internet access (wifi) available in the room. Rooms are spacious, clean and equipped with a kettle with a tea set. Recommended."
4324,Hotel with a very good location. We received a room on the upper floor with a view of the Old Brewery and the panorama of Poznan. Room neat and clean . A cool idea is a place to lie down by the window. In the evenings a beautiful view . Very good and varied breakfasts . I recommend to use the SPA services and the swimming pool. Great candle massage.
4325,He has a pretty good attitude towards patients. She has not noticed any differences in visits paid and reimbursed by the NFZ (sometimes doctors treat patients who pay for consultations better). He was an ophthalmologist who chose my first contact lenses. He was an ophthalmologist who gave me my first contact lenses. To help me put them on/down for the first time he was even after hours (his work).
4326,"I'll admit that I was very much hoping for this film. Looking at the cast, the potential of the plot and brothers (or brother and sister: D) Wachowski's could be promised a lot. Unfortunately, as it usually happens, out of a large cloud, little, or actually no rain. The film is simply boring, a climate with a candle searching. If the authors of the film wanted to see how well to show the pseudo- totalitarian state well, they could first watch Equlibrium or Brazil, because it came out pathetic. The plot in no place surprises and is predictable, the music . . . . .it wouldn't be, but it doesn't draw attention to itself. To sum up: a weak 2 / 5 from me and the only positive point for playing Natalie Portman , because the rest is unfortunately hopeless, I do not recommend . amen"
4327,"Professional approach to work, full commitment, individual treatment of each patient are just some of the doctor's features, besides the comfort of treatment and visits made the time of my orthodontic treatment not long at all, and visits were just a pleasure. Mrs. Kasia is not only a good orthodontist in her profession, but above all, she is a friendly woman of class with a high personal culture, always smiling and full of enthusiasm can perfectly establish contact with the patient. I wish everyone could meet such a doctor on their way to get a beautiful smile! I succeeded, and now my husband fights for such a smile, but with Mrs. Kasia it is pure pleasure!"
4328,"There were 'em with the family in the hotel for the weekend nice friendly atmosphere a large selection on the breakfast buffet and the Chef's Mrs. Great offered his son pancakes with cheese but our little one picked it up only that the lady prepared a super sandwich for the baby eyes of the little egg smile slipped like I never use it today. Clean rooms quietly, quietly, although the hotel is in the center of the hotel I highly recommend to everyone . . ."
4329,"This is my first visit to your doctor's office and we'll see what the results will be, but I hope it helps! She has proposed an appropriate treatment plan and now I am waiting for the results. I have another visit in 3 weeks' time to do an allergic test, where no dermatologist has ever thought about doing it before."
4330,"We have just come back from a ""weekend"" stay in Amax, we were tempted to go to this hotel after reading positive reviews. There was a free villa for 4 people, they went with a husband and a child - 2 days is a cost of 1600 PLN so the more they drove us with peace, without worrying what awaits us on the spot. The price finally obliges? The hotel is located in a nice place, we could park our car at the very house. Cottage in the middle requiring renovation, such a typical communist era, old tiles, bathroom in need of renovation, old furniture, fireplace, kitchen equipped with plates of cutlery, etc. A small fridge (and here, after opening it because we came with a month on the girlla, a glass bottle of beer threw up - of course the cost extra payable). A 2-storey cottage downstairs living room with an annexe + a bathroom. Upstairs 2 bedrooms in the bedrooms are full of spiders, flies, flies - but the husband somehow managed to deal with them - although in my opinion the hotel staff should take care of something like that before guests arrive. Bathrooms equipped with sets of cosmetics, I do not know if the quality is good because we have not used anything except soap for washing hands. What surprised us at the very beginning was the number of towels - if the house is for 4 people, then each person should have a set of towels, so we always got them in other hotels. Surprisingly not in the Amax, 2 large towels + 4 small ones to wipe at most the legs or hair on the head. We lit up the grill, sat down, went for a walk to explore the area, and that's all. In the morning breakfast, we were expecting wow - because of the price we paid, as well as the feedback from the facility. And here's another surprise - very poor breakfast, hot scrambled eggs, and sausages, 3 / 4 kinds of wedding cheese, yellow cheese cottage cheese, eggs tomatoes, cucumbers, jellies with what stuffing in the middle, pâté, bread (bread and broccoli), breakfast cereals, yoghurt only Augustów natural yoghurt, coffee tea, juice from the liqueur, and lemonade. What surprised us the most was the lack of fruit. We focused on the standard of scrambled eggs, bread and wedding. It was tasty. But really looking through the prism of the price we paid for 2 nights is very poor. In the hotel there is a swimming pool (from what I read even 2) we saw one - outside. There was a lot of insects swimming in it, so we went to the center of the micaceous, rented a refrigerator and so we spent the whole day. We came back around 6 p.m. - the cottage wasn't cleaned - but around Sunday, maybe the hotel staff is finally free. We lit up the barbecue, the doorbell - the cleaning staff asking if we need to clean the house? We found out that there is no point in cleaning at this time, especially since we have to leave in the morning - so what is the point of cleaning at this time? I thought the rooms were being cleaned in the morning? I'll add that the water bottles were also not delivered to us for another day. During the barbecue we found that it was a shame that we chose this hotel because we only wasted money, and for 300 / 600 zloty more we could have a room at the Hotel Mikolajki, or in Golebiewski. But it's like a man wants something different. After the barbecue we packed up and at 20 we returned home, in the end we had nothing to lose anyway - except for travel, another night and breakfast was not worth it. With + and only, a barbecue which is available on the spot, a quiet place with a nice view - and the rest are unfortunately disadvantages. We are demanding with our husband - and the price just isn't right for the quality. To pay 200 zloty a day for a room is okay, but for money like we paid, we were expecting wow. Anyway, the last time we suggested the opinions of people on the internet, because as you can see every person has different requirements, different standards and so on. Maybe for some people a stay in the Amax is a dream holiday, rest and so on. Not for us. We travel a lot, we have been in many hotels, and we are demanding people. The price should, in our opinion, go hand in hand with quality, here it did not happen. The first visit to this place and the last. Personally we do not recommend."
4331,"The hotel is located in an ideal place for hiking fans. Away from the hustle and bustle of Krupowki - close to the trails leading into the mountains. Rooms are spacious and clean . The service is very nice. The swimming pool is, however, not delightful with its charm. Very rich and tasty breakfasts . Also the food in the restaurant is really worth recommending. We have been guests of the hotel twice as much as a couple as a family with children and each time we were satisfied."
4332,"Generally speaking, the hotel is not one of the better ones. Most of the rooms are humid and smell bad, the air-conditioning is working, but also feel in the air that needs maintenance. Bathrooms require a thorough overhaul, the joints show a mold, adjustment of the wash basin faucets in many rooms also requires patience, but perhaps the worst thing that happened in our bathroom was the leaky sewage system. During the week the room was cleaned only once. A rat settled in one of the rooms. The hotel staff does not understand English. You can only communicate with the cleaners by means of gestures, the lady from the reception desk is trying very hard, but you could notice problems during the conversation. The only people you could get along with were the manager and the restaurant manager. Both men were very helpful. Waiters are young boys whose behavior does not necessarily appeal to women and conservative older people, although they try to keep tourists happy. The hotel is situated on a gentle hill, but the passage from the concrete shore to the restaurant or reception does not require huge energy deposits. As for the shore itself - no sand, no stones - just concrete, sharp slabs, which are dangerously slippery at high tides. No gentle descent into the water - you fall directly into the depth of about 3 meters (harbour bay). The shore is unfortunately contaminated with rubbish, bottles, dead fish and parts of boats. The area of the swimming pool is systematically visited by local dogs, which have no resistance to bathing or heating up on hotel deckchairs. The staff does not react to such situations, which is also an indication of the level of service. Regional food, served mostly cold / half warm. Tables are unfortunately often dirty. Only one type of beer, crayfish, wine and pure vodka is available in the bar, which was still missing. . . Plastic cups were not washed, but rather only rinsed, so many times the drinks had to be replaced. Wi - Fi free of charge in the reception hall and in its vicinity, no reach in the rooms. The surroundings of the hotel completely ""non-residential"" - highway and market. The hotel for people who do not require almost anything except the weather."
4333,"Cash-only payments, which in business and non-cash transactions is an inconvenient obstacle in the settlement of business trips. The rooms are very tight with a washbasin in the room, such as in the train cars (as far as both size and condition are concerned - it stinks of my stench was merciless) . In addition, a glass shower cabin arranged from the room space, separately only the toilet, i.e. a room not equipped with a bathroom, only a room with various sanitary installations. The air conditioning is probably unpreserved, I suspect that it is fungal, because after an hour of work we got allergic symptoms, to this unevenly noisy. Embarrassing equipment - not a single cupboard, CRT TV from the 90s. The lights are broken. The beds are adjacent to each other, with a strange installation (a set of walls) separating them at the head, so a conversation in a horizontal position is basically not possible. Stay on the road - one night with breakfast of two people for a good 220 PLN . Miserable breakfasts - no hot meal. At eight o'clock there was only water after the sausages (I suspect) until you ask for scrambled eggs. The cost of breakfast is realistically calculated by counting the roads, 23 zł in the package for 1 person for the night, standard 25. At night, noisy and poor soundproofing of rooms. Service personnel shaking in the corridor - from 8 a.m. cleaning lift cabins and blocking them . The standard is worthy of a hostel with a dubious reputation, especially because of the stinking fumes of dirt from the sewage system and ventilation. Dirt, conditions that are very bad for the hotel, so beware of Room 337 and the whole thing!"
4334,"It used to be a place to go back to. Today it's just good cuisine. Snuggle, spray. Rooms that aren't ventilated and smell musty. Rooms cut out by force. If a guy gets a room on the 3rd floor, he'll be very surprised. The lack of soap in the bathroom has not been reported for 5 days. Change of towels or bed linen! ! ! ...is too much for 5 days. Lack of service during the night so night rest under a big question mark . Spa ? only the sauna, which you have to sign up for anyway in advance. Only tasty cuisine, although breakfasts without revelation."
4335,"One example of the difficulties our body is currently facing is the excessive amount of sugar we supply ourselves with every day. ""Anthropological studies have shown that our ancestors consumed 200 grams of sugar per year 10,000 years ago. Today the average American eats 200 grams of sugar a day. It is not possible for us to adapt to such a change in evolution,"" emphasized Dr. med. Daniel Slide. Nowadays, sugar is in almost every product on the store shelves and has a strong addictive effect. We have become so addicted to sugar that without it many products do not taste good at all. ""Meanwhile, in the past sweets were made several times a year for special occasions. Nobody ate a candy bar when he was in a bad mood"" - recalled Dr. Magdalena Tomaszewska - Bolałek."
4336,"A beautiful tenement house decorated in an industrial way with an incredible climate. The spacious, modern rooms will satisfy even the most picky ones. View from the window directly to the old town - wonderful! Location in the very center, so close to the amazingly climate of bars and pubs. There is a bar, café, which will satisfy many coffeemakers. I can definitely recommend this place to all visitors to Lublin!"
4337,"Because the rules of bidding AdWords ads are transparent as opposed to natural positioning algorithms (especially for lay people). Our position will therefore only depend on our budget and efficient advertising strategy. Cosmetic would seem to be a change that could have a significant impact on the perception of the hotel. Instead of a list of opinions placed by guests we get their summary. We do not have any influence on them and we do not know the rules of what attitude, such an aggregated image of the hotel is created. From the point of view of a broader marketing strategy, where the idea of a hotel's narrative on the Internet is well thought out and coherent, it is a big threat."
4338,"Absolutely ideal location in the heart of Gdansk's Old Town, with all the services nearby. The house is situated in a courtyard without cars, so it is very quiet and peaceful, even though we are in the centre of events! The apartment for four people was clean and spacious. Everything worked very well and there was even a washing machine (which we didn't use, but I imagine it could be useful during a longer stay). The walls were thick, there was an elevator in the building. There is no wifi , but you can borrow the network cable from the reception ."
4339,"Hello Dr. Arkadiusz Kasztelan is a great specialist. On April 2, I underwent surgery to remove a vocal fold tumor. Everything was done professionally and without rare complications on the second day got em already discharged and was em at home . For today, it feels great to remove the tumor has been a huge relief in speaking . Shortness of breath and growing hoarseness have subsided. So if you're looking for a good qualified professional doctor, that's what Mr. Prfeszy friendly reliable is."
4340,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MRS. CAROLINE ! She is a very warm and cordial person, who can see that she loves her work. Her way of being allows her to be trusted quickly. She is smiling and infects with positive energy and the belief that problems are from solving them. Instead of falling into sadness, thanks to her, she quickly began to see everything a little differently. I started to accept myself more, I improved my relationship with people and with the girl right away. Her openness, support and understanding are of great value. It is enough to get to know her to change your mind about psychologists - not everyone is numb and silent. She helps you to change your life better! I am glad that he met her on his way !"
4341,"She booked me and paid for my room two months ago. Yesterday in the middle of the night after she arrived she got m room smelling of cigarettes . At the reception she heard m that unfortunately only such a room was left, all the rest is occupied. I was offered that ""you may come in and have a freshener."" The reception desk realized that the room was in such a state. Despite sleeping with the window open in the morning, the smell was just as intense. I come out with an irritated throat and the feeling that I would spend the night in a smoky pub. In my opinion, if a hotel has such a damaged room that needs to be refreshed, but not using a spray freshener, it should not count as available to guests. It is simply unhealthy and disgusting. The room stinks as if it were a smoking room throughout its existence. I am very disappointed. I understand that the prices are promotional, but some conditions are standard for even the most modest hotels."
4342,"HORRIBLE. I read other people's opinions and I don't know if they were exhibiting them after 5 seconds or if they use a different model than me. The mouse is very pretty, lies well in your hand and is relatively cheap for a wireless model. Theoretically it beats on the head so products like logitech which look very average in the same price. Unfortunately, it has two major drawbacks; it devours the batteries at an alarming rate, about 1 per week, and this despite the second drawback: it automatically goes into a state of suspension after a few minutes, which is * terribly * foul in the long run. I don't know how the engineers have achieved such a battery-eating effect in spite of the device falling asleep, but it is definitely the most annoying mouse that bought 'em. I would strongly advise against it."
4343,"First of all, the location in the very centre, right next to the marketplace, deserves praise. The service is very helpful and friendly. There is free internet access in the hotel, while the quality of the connection leaves a little to be desired - I have broken the connection several times. The room is neat and spacious. Unfortunately, the lighting in the dark room, especially at the bedside, can make reading or working difficult. Beds are small and not very comfortable. The second big plus for very tasty with a rich breakfast with the possibility of an additional choice of how to prepare the eggs (scrambled eggs in butter / ham / bacon or egg planted in different variants - all included in the price). To sum up, I recommend this place for a business visit to Nowy Sącz."
4344,"Honestly, I didn't expect anything like that to happen. She feels cheated by them. They don't care about people, they don't respect them. They're taking money out. They make you pay the same money for a place on the floor as for a bed, and they don't give you bedding or a mattress. They are incompetent. They don't give a damn about the good of man. O 22 . At 00 you have to sleep, or else the staff will be in the hall. I do not recommend this hostel to anyone."
4345,"The problem is that too high a dose of insulin not matching the amount of food and exercise can lead to a large drop in blood sugar, the so-called hypoglycemia. ""It is the hypoglycemia that the athletes, parents and, of course, doctors are most afraid of,"" noted Dr. Gawrecki. Hypoglycemia can manifest itself in weakness, drowsiness, increased sweating, hand trembling, nausea, but also in behavioural changes and aggression. In extreme situations and lack of help leads to coma, convulsions, loss of consciousness and even death. ""The patient and his parents need to be educated so that they can best prepare for physical activity - e.g. take into account the reduction of insulin doses, or the possible intake of additional carbohydrates if the blood glucose value decreases significantly. For this purpose it is necessary to strictly control the glycemia after training, also at night, because then hypoglycemia can also occur"" - explained Dr. Gawrecki. According to him, this requires good cooperation with a diabetologist and a lot of self-discipline from children and parents."
4346,"Well done and stable. We have been using for a year and we are satisfied . The only significant drawback is the way we move around the room with this chair. Because it only has wheels at the back, to move it, you have to lift the front part, there is only one problem - there is no need to grab it. All the parts are quite strong, but even with a slight lift (and even more so with the child inside), you bend the parts you grab and feel like something is about to break. In the show film there is a fictional way of moving, because in such a bend you can break your spine :) . It is often the case that you only need to slightly change the position of the chair or move it to the table with your child and every time you have a big problem with it. The best thing to do would be to attach the strap to the lower part of the front legs and then a small lift would allow you to move it. Besides, everything is ok. Maybe two such lightweight covers on the backrest would also be useful, because it is made of leatherette and the child lying on it sweats immediately - so easy washability is also not entirely true, because you always have to put something under the child's bottom, back and head so that it does not sweat. In general I think it is good, I have a comparison with another seat and this one is much better."
4347,"Dr Katarzyna Niemirowicz-Laskowska from the UMB said that studies have been carried out, which show that the developed product both improves the so-called ""lubricity"" (associated with friction), but also has antimicrobial properties, takes care of hygiene for the patient, because it does not allow the development of plaque. ""The whole art lies in the fact that each preparation has its own specific properties, while obtaining several beneficial properties in one preparation is certainly a challenge. And this does not mean that we have made the best preparation, absolutely not. You know you have to work on it. However, we have managed to create a preparation that at least combines four or five properties of natural saliva. This is a phenomenon"" - said prof . Tsar."
4348,"Nice, calm and that's where his + ends. I was at his place with spurs in Euromedicare. He wasn't very communicative and he was probably a bimba as to what is being said to him. He didn't really help me and she had to go to someone else's house in private."
4349,"As a member of the Le Club Accor programme, I have a strong reference to many hotels in the Accora chain - from budget to luxury hotels. However, in full knowledge, I can say that this is the first hotel where I really felt I was treated as a guest. The hotel's staff - full of professionalism, from the friendly reception desk to the restaurant, breakfast room and housekeeping. As a member of the LCAH, he received an upgrade of the rooms that he booked 'em in, a gift was waiting in the room with a handwritten welcome letter from the hotel's director. As part of the welcome drink - a wide range of offers. As part of the ""Time for Sightseeing"" offer, we received free vouchers from the hotel to be used in the Gdynia Film Centre, which is located next to the hotel. Free non-alcoholic beverages in the Privilege room - a great solution, although we used them in moderation: ) . I recommend the hotel restaurant - especially fish soup we liked. And Mr. Luke - a waiter, who . . . sweeps - an amazing personality - the right person in the right place. The hotel's swimming pool is the weakest point of the facility - it is probably currently in the swimming school franchise, but this does not bother the hotel guests - a little bit intimate, but the advantage is the full size and sauna. The location of the hotel is excellent - it is close to the harbour and there are many cool bars and pubs nearby. The surroundings of Gdynia Film Centre and Music Theatre adds to the reputation of the place. Generally speaking, my opinion of the hotel is actually the highest possible. The hotel has restored my faith in the LCAH Program, which after previous experience did not have too high ""flights"" with me. After this stay I realized that the assumptions of the program are not bad, but it mainly depends on the management, the prudence of the staff and the quality of service - for me a hotel managed in a model way! I recommend to everyone - I will definitely come back."
4350,"A great doctor. Competent, with great knowledge and experience. Able to accept a patient at home almost in the middle of the night or come with a home visit . As a super doctor, but certainly not an accessible person. Rather rude and closed in on himself."
4351,"Good morning , If you are looking for an unusual experience , if you are looking for a high dose of adrenaline and unusual behavior I invite you to the hotel Gołębiewski in Mikołajki . I had the dubious pleasure of hosting in this hotel on 29 . 09 . 2017 . Checking in at the reception desk with children among other families was em witnessed extremely rude behavior on the part of the hotel staff . He mentioned the staff here, although at a later stage of this evening he found out that the people responsible for this incident did not admit to working in this hotel, a separate thread should be analyzed whether the employer is maintaining appropriate standards in relation to the employee or whether he is employing the police illegally. I was very embarrassed by the use of violence against hotel guests. At the reception desk in front of the children and other guests, the security officers jumped on the 3 - echoes of the gentlemen and started to kick, beat and jump on them in the most savage way. Luckily, the bigger fight did not take place just because the gentlemen did not want to start a brawl. The protection was more like a KSW fight than a hotel stay. Their actions and behavior made children cry and surprised other guests. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone."
4353,"This was our 4th holiday in Greece and by far the worst hotel we've been in so far. The omnipresent smell of chlorine, wasps by the swimming pools, bars and restaurants and mosquitoes in the room, which very much bit our son and did not allow him to sleep at night. We're not sure we'll be back there."
4354,"for me hopeless, I will never again go to this doctor for an appointment, for me he is conceited and too confident, I understand when it's good every doctor is great, but for me the doctor must also be a psychologist, when she told me that my pregnancy is abnormal, he presented me 3 variants of the consequences of this pregnancy but he pointed out that after all I don't have to adopt the baby anyway because as long as I have uteruses and ovaries it is in vitro. . . . . .she was broken, she cried all the way home, and I will remember his words for the rest of my life, now I am a natural pregnancy and so far I do not think about in vitro, because I do not have to. . . . . .and I'm not going to change my push-ups. . ."
4355,"Unfortunately, Dr. Korczak didn't help me. . . I have had a problem with acne for a long time and the doctor's prescriptions did not work. She had an impression that she had no idea at all about the treatment and she was prescribing what was going on. Maybe she is a better speculator in other cases, she did not help me."
4357,"I recommend this hotel - great view, great access. The hotel service at the highest level - clean and cozy. Only when it comes to kitchens, I have some reservations - the chef probably aspires to masterchef but he does not succeed. The dishes look nice but they lack good taste. Please change to a more regional cuisine and I will be a regular guest. And cold water in the pool - but maybe I overdo it: )"
4358,Kos beautiful island hotel ok swimming pools ok food good close to amphibians amphibian beautiful sandy gentle descent to the sea Aegean sea wonderful turquoise walk quite fast access to the center where there are numerous bars island very charming przpropekne views worth renting a car
4359,"We are embarrassed by the look of standard plus rooms! It's like I'm back 50 years. Clinic rooms . We surrendered we had to leave the resort . No pictures of standard plus double rooms in the internet . The view of the room scared us, but also in our presence another family who came with a child. I do not recommend! I do not recommend this type of rooms."
4361,"Very cool place. The area is quite extensive, but nicely developed. There are cottages of different standard and equipment. You can fish, swim, use the rope park. . . There is a mini zoo, a playground for children, a water slide, places for bonfires. Really everything is organized with an idea. The food really is very good. The standard may not be the highest, but in such places it's not about that. Generally a good place for a weekend outing, for example."
4362,"Quite a large complex with a nice swimming pool and saunas. The biggest disadvantage was the waitress's behaviour during breakfast. The son and daughter somehow had a poor breakfast so the wife wanted to take their yogurt for later. She hid it in a bag and put it on a chair. From then on we had the strange feeling that we were being watched and talked to by the staff. After some time, the yoghurt disappeared from the bag. The waitress pulled it out of our private purse when we were making our tea. We were summoned for a conversation to the president who informed us that we were not taking food out of the restaurant (even a bun made for a child, fruit, etc.). We apologized for our fo pa. However, the waitress's behaviour is dramatic and looking into the private belongings of hotel guests without their knowledge should not take place. The waitress didn't overdo it and behaved arrogantly to us. The food in the hotel is average, you always had to ask the staff because something was missing. Breakfast service is a different story - chopped plates and cups, unfinished cutlery, as for 4 * it's very poor."
4364,"I am forced to change my grade for worse - it turns out that apart from the nice atmosphere during my first visit to the gynecologist's, the doctor did not do any specific tests except for ultrasound. She asked me to do a cytology - she was 21 years old, the doctor said that there is no rush and only after some time. There was no order to have the blood tested before the birth control; she mistook a small ectopy for a large erosion (which could not develop during these 6 months). I am waiting for the results of cytology from another doctor. . ."
4365,"Dr. Angel. . . . .to look for such great doctors these days. . . I came to your doctor's office to ask for a consultation because she felt I was being badly treated by another endocrinologist. . . . . .my intuition did not disappoint me. The doctor gave me 45 minutes to translate the results of the tests and make sure that she understood everything. I was finally examined because no doctor had done this for six months. I have been going from office to office for a long time, she has already spent thousands of zloty on appointments, tests and medicines, but such a wonderful doctor has not yet had the opportunity to meet. After the meeting with the doctor, I hope that there are still doctors by appointment."
4366,"Neurosurgeon Dr. . Olaf Pierzak from the hospital in Sieradz is a great doctor and man . He was a patient of the hospital in Sieradz, I had a very complicated spinal surgery. On the second day after the surgery, I was able to move on my own. I can't believe that nowadays there are still doctors who approach patients with their hearts. Now I believe that angels walk on Earth. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Doctor, for your super professional help, your health and your approach to the suffering person. You are a great doctor. I recommend to all patients the perfect doctor, Doctor. Olaf Pierzak."
4367,"I support both statements 100% , very unpleasant lady . She missed her approach a little bit when she saw a man in the office, she immediately got angry and tried to be a little nicer. She made the wrong diagnosis. The physiotherapist wondered how such a healthy child was directed to rehabilitation, and the psychologist to whom she referred my daughter asked how such a developed child was directed to rehabilitation and psychological examination. I advise against visiting this lady. Nothing concrete can be learned from her, she remains silent throughout the visit and notes something to herself by changing only the colours of the pens and when we ask a question she answers rudely and oilily. She is terribly unpleasant and brazen. I advise against visiting this woman."
4368,"The resulting report goes to the investor immediately after the visit of our representative. If the hotel successfully passes the evaluation process, it is included in the chain. Then the quality of services offered by the hotel is monitored at least once a year"". , says Gheorghe Marian Cristescu , Regional Sales Director of Best Western for Poland . Piotrków Trybunalski is considered to be the logistics centre of Poland. Therefore, the majority of visitors coming to the city are representatives of both national and international companies operating in logistics parks located around the city. This trend can also be seen in the structure of hotel reservations, as even 60% of them are made by business customers."
4370,"Hello, I'm 22 years old at the Doctor's for 2 years. . . He was the only doctor who took me seriously. He ordered a lot of tests, it took six months before he started treating me. After his second visit, he probably found that he suspected a brain tumor. . . She scared me. But she did an MRI and I have MS. . . . .that she wouldn't have detected without the Doctor. . . Now he's found me ovarian cancer. Not really interesting at all. He said I had two years to get pregnant. Actually, I owe him a lot. He took the tests done not with him / even told me himself that it would be cheaper. He's extremely kind to me, but I know he's worried about the stock."
4371,"I'm adding two "" stars "" just because of the beautiful countryside. Besides, I have no reason to come back here. Unfortunately, the hotel has lived through years of its glory, which can be seen in the already worn out (at least in our room) shower head, broken wardrobe handles and drawers or windows that are difficult to close (the guy at hand had no dare at all ;)). I especially do not recommend staying in this hotel to people whose diet is different from the ""traditional"" one. My mother cannot eat gluten or lactose because of the disease, but I am a vegetarian. We informed you about this fact when booking a room by phone. On the day of arrival, we were informed that the dinner is organized in a barbecue. We didn't have anything to look for there, so we were invited to the Charlotte restaurant instead, but it wasn't as colourful as we expected. Of the main dishes only two are vegetarian - a salad with mould cheese and cranberry sauce (if you can call it a main course) and dumplings with spinach and mould cheese. Therefore, no vegetarian soups in the restaurant are a choice. When asked what vegetarian soup the waiter could offer me, she got me a proposal of fish, I am sorry that the hotel employs staff clearly suggesting that fish is a plant. My mother was offered a broth, it's just a pity that the waiter forgot that the pasta contains gluten. In addition, at breakfast the other day, my mother was given gluten-free bread (great!), but no margarine was served in which there would be far less milk than in butter or gluten-free sausage. She ended up eating dry bread with vegetables. Unfortunately, she did not get gluten-free dessert either. For our stay, she and her mother received several ""coupons"". , for billiards / bowling, 100zł to the spa and for dessert in the . in . restaurant . Just like the first two I can't get attached to the first one, we took advantage of it and we were very pleased : ) As to the third one, unfortunately, I have to, because as it turned out in the restaurant, this dessert is nothing but a cup of ice cream and whipped cream, which my mother could not eat, for known reasons - lactose, sorbets unfortunately the restaurant does not have. As for the spa - I took advantage of the classic massage, mom with henna eyebrows, we were very pleased. In the pool unfortunately cold water. The main purpose of coming to this place was probably for us to relax and enjoy the silence, unfortunately we also did not experience this. On the second day of our stay in the hotel was organized a wedding, about which unfortunately the lady in the registration when booking a room did not inform us, and it's a pity, because they certainly would have chosen to laugh with Mom somewhere else. There was no nighttime silence, all night long there was loud music playing, which resulted in my sleeplessness, and for the next day I was waiting for a 4-hour drive. To sum up, we are not going to return to this hotel, unfortunately, the beautiful surroundings are not everything."
4372,"I'm terrified of the opinions she read m . She was with him as well, and the fact that he has a specific humor. For the time being, in total, specific tests did not do m because I'm not yet trying to have a child, but once she decides, I think I have to change the doctor. If you have someone better, write the names, I will gladly use."
4373,"After 4 visits to Dorota I feel much better. In addition to her expertise and skills, she is also very contactable, kind and sincere. I don't have too much resistance to undressing in my underwear and feeling at ease, and normally this is a big problem for me. We laugh that she should have a physiotherapist's plate on the door, because during the procedure we also talk about what e.g. causes me stress and thus muscle tension. However, it is not only about making it nice. Dorota has many years of experience, vast theoretical knowledge and passion and this translates into high quality of services. I recommend as well as I was recommended."
4374,"urs : Mathematical analysis , exercises Evaluation: No. 1 [ / b ] If you don't want to get tired, count, hit this woman. The tasks are simple, it does not introduce an atmosphere of fear in the classes, and in addition, when he sees that the group does not understand something, he tries to repeat the lecture in his own way. Oh, be sure to report to the board - she likes people who are active in class!"
4375,"Our first and I already know that not the last stay in the hotel, Kazimierzówka, will remain in our memory for a long time. The hotel is located in an amazing place. Maybe the location at a considerable height in relation to the Market Square is a certain, climbing, challenge, but well: you can not have everything. But we have peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the Market Square. The beautiful and well-kept garden invites you to spend some time here with a book or a glass of wine. Cool climatic, air-conditioned and cozy and well-kept rooms fully allow you to relax after the hardships such as visiting Kaziemierz. There is also a SPA and recreation areas such as billiard table, table football, ping-pong table and table football. But, Kazimierzówka, these are mostly cool people. Open-minded and eager to help. And what particularly charmed us was the hotel restaurant. The menu is quite extensive because about 12 main dishes so it is not difficult to find something for yourself. All the dishes and we tried most of them are fantastic. Excellent in taste and even better served. Even the cheeks of beef become exquisite here because of the preparation of the dish. We were lucky and pleased that our culinary advisor was Mrs. Martyna. Fully professional and at the same time cheerful, cheerful, smiling and endowed with an incredible sense of humor. It is also impossible to ignore the silence of fantastic breakfasts. The Swedish table is bending under the pressure of all kinds of delicacies. As if that wasn't enough for someone, an additional order of freshly prepared omelette, pancakes or scrambled eggs is no problem. Thank you."
4376,"The stay in this hotel was a pleasant surprise. Nice rooms, all well maintained, nice atmosphere. The only thing that did not deserve 5 stars is the indoor swimming pool (entering it hits us with such a strong smell of chlorine that man immediately resigned) and Jacuzzi (tragic). One of the advantages of this hotel is that it has a wonderful staff: Yordanka - animator, a wonderful girl who took care of our active holiday, at the same time gained our friendship with her kindness and cheerfulness - if you hit on her you will have a wonderful holiday. I will also have a very nice memory of the bartenders at the ""Disco"": George and Andrew - I admire the fact that although they have unpleasant situations with guests who are too drunk, they are still authentically friendly and cheerful. Not to mention that they know their job and make very good drinks. I think the nice bartender in the lobby bar also deserves to be mentioned, unfortunately she didn't know his name (tall, black hair to the neck). Unlike a few other bartenders there, there was no feeling of pretending kindness from him. I couldn't help but mention the bartender Ria. I will miss her very much. Thanks to people like her, staying at the hotel was like paradise on Earth to us. More people who like their work and who immediately feel better (they should be given a bonus because they make people want to come back to this place). As for the food: very tasty, but a little heavy (at least for me). The area of the resort is huge, so it was a pleasant surprise to me that it is so neat. Every day at 21. 30 is organized in the amphitheatre (the best in my opinion was the spectacle ""Circus""), so you can not complain about boredom. To sum up the hotel deserves its 5 stars, it looks as beautiful as the pictures. The big advantage is the great service, especially people dedicated to their work, which I mentioned here. I recommend it with a clear conscience and I will surely come back there one day : )"
4377,"At the beginning of January we went to the Pension Pod Wietrzna Góra for a 3-day stay, we used the Groupon offer. The guesthouse is in a great location, close to the market. It has 9 rooms of different sizes. I recommend family rooms, they are much larger than 2-person rooms, and the price difference is not that big. These rooms are located on the first floor of the guesthouse, which is an advantage. On the ground floor, apart from the restaurant, there are two more rooms for 2 people - those (due to their location) are not recommended. Our room was very pleasantly furnished, spacious, with a nice view. The restaurant of the guesthouse serves very tasty dishes and friendly service. For breakfast on the 1st day there was a ""Swedish table"" - a choice sufficient, but without revelation. On the 2nd day of the stay, as we were told ""due to the small number of guests"" breakfast was served - to choose from several breakfast sets. This, unfortunately, came as a surprise to us, there is a fundamental difference when I can choose after a small amount from several hot and cold assortments and not as we were offered. This has left a ""rasp"" after this pleasant stay. But in general, the stay is a success."
4378,"A massacre is a little bit of a mouthful. Only nice lady from reception. That's a shitty little thing to say. I guess the bosses are a big shot at getting to the customer. In the rooms, they're a mess, and they appreciate it like grain. NO INTERNET COVERAGE. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT AND I ADVISE AGAINST ANYONE! !"
4379,"I know a lot of hotels in Pszczyna and the surrounding towns. It was the first time that I got to the Hotel Piaskowy, next to it, on the way to Bielsko, I drove em many times. At the reception desk there was a very nice party, efficient and friendly - at the arrival of Mrs. Teresa, at the departure of Mrs. Magdalena. A quiet room, clean and spacious - he asked them for one with a view of the sand, not on the route to Bielsko, busy. Bathroom of appropriate size . The kitchen is a very strong point of the hotel - a short dish card, but allowing a rational choice. Mr. Mariusz is a very professional waiter, friendly, discreet, the dishes were delivered very quickly. Tasty, generous, beautiful composition on a plate. I recommend local dessert kick."
4380,"Avoid this place with a wide arch! ! ! Incompetent service, disgusting food and no choice, small rooms and the bathroom is a mockery! ! ! The only small plus is cleanliness. There is no question of five stars, I think even two is too much."
4381,"The room standard was not compatible with the beautiful pictures in the catalogue. The wall in the room was very dirty, the door to the bathroom was missing a handle, the air-conditioning system was MOISTURE and full of dust. In the bathroom the tiles were molded, the stool was dirty and rusty, the mirror was dirty / molded. Shower and soapbox dirty, rusty, dirty soap / liquid from previous occupants. Wardrobe door full of greasy palm prints of previous occupants . Throughout the stay this state has not improved. The peak of ignorance was the extremely rare exchange of sheets and towels. Although the bed linen was sweaty, it was not changed. Towels were left dirty and wet in the bathtub - the ladies who cleaned only hung these towels. The bed linen and towels were only changed twice."
4382,"Mathematical analysis I (lecture and exercises) Electrical interesting, quite understandable yes, explains everything""."
4383,"The biologist admits that it is even more difficult - and in the case of people completely unethical - to get offspring from two males. In this case it is necessary to induce the male individuals to produce oocytes. The scientist explains that from an embryo of the male sex one obtains embryonic stem cells, which have the ability to differentiate into germ cells. When these cells multiply, in 3% of them there is a spontaneous loss of the Y chromosome. From such cells you can then - after adding the X chromosome from male cells - obtain female mice - chimeras, which produce egg cells originating from male embryonic stem cells . These chimeras are crossed with a sexually mature male . In this way they can be born young, whose genetic material comes from two male individuals."
4384,"I don't recommend this gynaecologist to anyone, although I have been his patient for almost 3 years. Often during the visit I get the impression that he deliberately says little to ""float me down"" as soon as possible. He creates a great distance to the patient, he answers the questions he asks in a casual and incomprehensible way, he does not justify his statements. . . . The only plus of these visits is (almost) stress-free examination. Now I am at the stage of trying to get a baby, so I will definitely change my gynecologist, because I cannot imagine this doctor leading my pregnancy. . . . ``The assessment has been changed to "" I advise against "" . Reason: The content of the comment does not indicate a lack of competence of the doctor . ` ` `"
4385,"The hotel is very spaciousNot recommended for families with small children everywhere far away because the reception desk places families far away from the swimming pool and restaurantJourney with a small child from the end of the hotel to the restaurant about 17 minutes when it rains. I know what I'm saying because the elevators have been dreaming about at night. The kitchen is very decent. Dining room opened too short for dinner. The staff can ask for 20 of them from the dining room. For a 4-star hotel, it's a bit excessive. The managers solve problems by offering a drink. If someone likes it, please, thank you very much, I am changing the hotel."
4386,"Hotels furnished in the old walls have their own climate - here Castle Ryn is my favourite - all furnished in a medieval climate combined with style and elegance. The room and bathroom are very spacious. The restaurant in the refectory is impressive - good breakfasts served in the form of a Swedish table, the choice is varied. The swimming pool is small but very atmospheric - with a fireplace, cross-ribbed brick ceilings, which seems to be ideal for a romantic evening. The service is nice and helpful. I recommend - was 'em for the weekend and I'll be back for sure."
4387,"Unfortunately, despite many good comments here, I have to give him the worst possible opinion: (this doctor is unfortunately not guided by the results of bandages. He didn't even order them from me, so all the time he treated me badly and I didn't get better. So he said that he would put me in the hospital and take my cerebral spinal fluid. Maybe he needed a guinea pig for his classes with students. . . When I came to him with the tests that another doctor sent me to do, he just smelled that they were blurring his picture. And the case was obvious, only that the research didn't fit his earlier assumptions. . . It's a pity to talk, maybe he helped others, but if it's more important for the doctor to have his own ego, his own ""intuition"" than a reliable approach to the problem, then I thank you. Keep him away from me if you have a serious problem! ! Greetings"
4388,"I recommend this Lord to all those who would like to go to an uninteresting performance - the monodrama ""Immunology - Supplement"" . I strongly advise against it. I have been treating infertility for 3 years, I am after the failed ICSI. Immunology was a mystery for me, which I wanted to solve in my office on Górczewska Street. She took with her all the tests: hormones, ultrasound, etc. The ""doctor"" from the beginning was not interested in the tests I brought with me or what I have to say. The visit itself is practically a 30 minute lecture about infertility. The doctor used a card, a pen and a marker to explain why there is no embryo development. All the time he used English terms and phrases, getting deeper and deeper into immunology. He did not pay any attention to my case and the characteristics of the problem. He even said that ""please don't tell me anything, because you'll mess with my head"". The possibility of treatment was conditioned by the abundance of his wallet, repeating several times that ""he can do anything for me for 7 thousand. He said, ""You can do me a base for a thousand and a few studies for 1 thousand"" - without any elaboration or description. It did not guarantee cure, success, failure - it did not explain how these studies would help and look. All the time the ""doctor"" maintained the pose of a wise man and the ""alpha and omega"" infertility issues. The visit cost 200 PLN and it was money that the man simply cheated. If he hadn't had the distance to this category of swindlers and magicians, he would have left me in a state of total disintegration and loss - including the ""doctor"" is a true master. I sincerely advise against meeting this man."
4390,"Dear Mom. I have the same opinion about this breast pump as you, the worst breast pump in my life. . . He wasn't pumping, his breasts hurt. I gave my breast pump to complain. She fought me a little bit with Canpol, but the end of the matter was that I got my money back. It's best to talk to the midwife what breast pump would recommend. The midwife has experience and knows which one works. If you're going birthing school, you can ask her. Or you can ask other experienced moms. If you find a moment, write to Canpol. They think their breast pumps are reliable. I've been writing my complaint and I've quoted some of their opinions. And don't be discouraged - the first time they always reject your complaint. Write your complaints ! ! !"
4391,"Looking at all the opinions you can get a little confused, positive opinions balance out negative ones. However, I have to add the wrong opinion. I would also like to point out that everyone has the right to their own opinion and the ladies who criticize others for giving bad opinions should rethink the essence of this forum - after all, it is precisely to express their private opinion. The doctor actually speaks on the phone, does not gynecological examination, did not interview me about my past diseases and ailments, after describing my current problems she directed me to expensive examinations ok . 600 PLN, then it bordered on a miracle to consult them because the lines are a few months ahead. . I don't recommend it, you certainly can't quickly diagnose your problems with her."
4392,"The specialist said that so far in neurosurgery traditional neuronavigation has been used. It consists in the fact that a day, and at the latest a few hours before the surgery, the brain imaging of the patient is performed by means of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Then they are inserted into the neuro-navigation system, which leads the neurosurgeons to the place in the brain to be operated on. ""The latest method is intraoperative neuro-navigation, which allows to perform procedures in real time. Thanks to this, brain operations can be even more precise"" - emphasized prof . The tooth. They are performed in a magnetic field, obtained thanks to magnetic resonance imaging 3 , 0 Tesla. They are so precise that they allow to determine the operation field with the accuracy of 1 mm."
4394,"I do not recommend, we went on holiday with OSCAR office, ALLINCLUSIVE hOTEL MONTEVISTA - LIORET DE MAR ! ! ! We were tempted to travel by the PREMIUM bus, where there was supposed to be much more space between the seats! I'm almost 200cm tall and this is where our holiday horror began, because we were stuffed in a bottle. We were picked up by a bus of normal size in the dog department. For me dribble total me both ways! ! ! ! I do not recommend the OSCAR office (nobody informed us about the change of bus) Stay in the hotel. . . . . for the entire stay 1 ! x seafood has been served, so that I follow the gourmets, you will not find this menu in montevista! ! a mighty MINUS FOR THE HOTEL! Other surprises are: in the hotel, there is a nasty, spraying ""old shaggy"" bartender who has to force everything on all incl. Being there with a few years old every time I went to get him some juice, I had to bargain with them to the honourable bartender because he could not give me 2 pieces at once! ! No paranoia of any kind! ! Ice cream is the same, the two didn't give the old man a bad name. A drink for the wife, forget it, you two have to go out with each other: ) ) ) For me, the guy to release. Another surprise is that we have not been informed that there will be youth camps from Poland in the hotel, so our little child at the hotel pool has learned all the Polish vulgarities including showing his or her middle finger! ! ! I skip lying quietly at the pool. . . . ...all the screaming and screaming, splashing the water of the sunbathing people by constantly jumping on the bomb into the pool, we were broken by it, after a few days we missed the pool from afar (the pool was also a big plus for us when choosing a hotel). To report to the reception desk that the dryer in the bathroom is not working you just spread your hands. . . . . . Another zonk is a big applause for the organizers for accommodating us with a few years old in front of the lifts! ! ! The child was asleep only about 23 - 24 hours after the whole ""cheerful"" youth entered our floor! And at the end of the whole expedition we were waiting for a sensational stabbing in the bus in which several passengers with drivers took part, which very frightened our little one. So once again I warn you, do not get caught up in the premium long bus and hotel montevista . ps . it was the first in years so ""colorful"" our vacation and the first time with an oscar. . . . . . ."
4395,"The problem, which was the reason for our visit to your doctor, is not difficult to diagnose, however, the immediate diagnosis and - above all - the perfectly selected treatment, gave almost immediate improvement of the patient's condition. A significant role in the process of treatment applied by your doctor. Apart from pharmacology, the doctor's approach to the patient, his personality, the atmosphere he creates during the conversation and the trust he inspires. I would like to thank Dr. Jakub Skrzeszewski for his help and for the fact that although I am only a patient's companion, I also leave the meeting with him stronger and calmer. ."
4396,"The hotel from the outside is quite nice, but that's where the positives end up. Access to the lake - as predecessors wrote completely hopeless. The service is very unpleasant. In this seemingly hotel shit and dirt. I recommend the sight of a dead and decaying rat in the window of the so-called. table tennis room. The owner is unavailable to give him his opinion about this building . The staff says it's not his fault. And here they are, in my opinion, right . And food is a separate topic. The most interesting is the guests' racing for anything to eat. The food is on the level of the bottom of the Żbik Lake next to this building. To sum up, it's a real shame to have money, even if you buy your stay through a group buying portal. I definitely warn you about this place that dares to call itself a hotel and a four-star addition!"
4397,"This was my second stay at the President Hotel. She drove me with good memories of the previous one but also with curiosity how it will be this time. And it turned out that she came back m like to herself! In addition to maintaining an adequate 4 * level of service, the hotel is distinguished by its unforced friendly atmosphere, both at the reception and in the restaurant, full of smiles, jokes and at the same time focus on the needs of the client. It is very conducive to rest, feeling like the right person in the right place. Here you are not impersonal, this is your own place in the world, where you want to bring family and friends: ) ) Specifics: spacious, nicely furnished room, frequent change of towels and bed linen, bathrobes for the pool; buffet meals, varied and tasty; during the weekend the pool is open to 24 and in the saunas mysterious sauna treatments - foreman - all included in the price: ) ) The only drawback - too expensive wine for dinner. ("
4399,"The place and the decor itself may be nice, but on a New Year's Eve trip with minus - 10 degrees continuous lack of heating and hot water problems are not a convenience. These are not cheap accommodation, after skiing you expect something better, a warm room. In most of the apartments the underfloor heating but not working. The radiators in the few rooms are icy. I don't recommend it, they are reminiscent of the conditions in the early 90s."
4400,"The GTA4 was approached by em with great emotion. He was sure that the game would keep me company for a long time and would provide a great experience. He was wrong about 'em. From the beginning, the installation was annoying, playing with these security features. A legal user shouldn't have that much trouble. Gta4 on my pretty solid company wasn't going as if I was expecting it. On the low details it could still slow down in certain locations. Also, the game itself was not the best. I did not like driving. GTA4 got bored quickly. I personally prefer Vice City and San Andreas."
4401,"Spending New Year's Eve was a really nice experience. The rooms were quite clean, although you could find small shortcomings. Tasty food, nice service. The swimming pool is relatively large and the saunas are well maintained. The most pleasant thing about the hotel is the lack of constant control and the obligation of identification. The kids could enter the New Year's Eve ball without any problem. A very nice atmosphere, but the team was not one of the best. Rather focused on film competitions they played heavy pieces to dance. But when the DJs started to play everything was great. If someone wants to spend time in a calmer and family atmosphere with a clear conscience I recommend."
4402,"If it's not a slat for that price. There's almost nothing inside. What is the price of such a product . It's practically just an extension cord. Don't expect too much from this equipment. Wojtek, where did you get that thing that keeps the power on? It's not a UPS, and the strips don't protect against power outages. . . Anyway, if you don't have a new grounded installation in your socket, there's no point in buying any slats, because none of them will work. Well, unless you want an extension cord. . . As well as every strip to protect your computer from lightning (close or straight in line) must be supported by lightning arresters type B and C in the installation."
4403,"Good materials and workmanship . The constructors managed to construct a wind factory - a huge size of the ... . 10 12cm fans and only for 8 drives 3 , 5 ? The rest for what ? For a bucket of water for water cooling ? Behind the mainboard, 12-16 drives 3 and 5 could be easily accommodated in the cheaper version of the sled, in the grazing version with a backplane-m. Waste of space . Hang the power supply vertically above the motherboard, we gain the whole page for a MIGHT disk magazine. Pity . Good for the base for just such processing ."
4404,"This time I am not satisfied with the physiotherapist's approach to the pacient. Mr. Bartosz did not send me back to the orthopedist or on the ultrasound, but he treated my pain as a false alarm and applied the therapy on a better or worse basis. After I had an inflammation, I went to an ultrasound and was diagnosed with a ""2nd degree injury to a close-to-long adductor's trailer"". I think you should take people more seriously and you can also say that you don't know something and you don't do therapy without being sure of the result."
4405,"Our first impressions of the hotel were medium. I say in advance that we are not demanding and we always go with our fiancée to hotels 2 and 3 * so we know that we should not expect any luxuries - we care about the price because we never spend much time in the hotel. The service is really nice and helpful (with a few exceptions). The hotel as well as the whole town of Pefkos is typically focused on tourists from England. We constantly had the impression that apart from the English, other nationalities were overlooked and ""unnoticed"" i.e. Poles, Czechs, Hungarians. The hotel was clean, the food was pretty good but the same thing all the time. . after a week of departure we had a problem to squeeze in the minced meat processed from dinner to a meat casserole for dinner the next day and other ""modifications"" - fortunately we were only a week away. What was the surprise that All Inclusive from 2017 onwards. with alcohols contains only beer, wine and local specific Ouzo alcohol. The hotel saves a nice location and service - recommended for the undemanding."
4406,"A good hotel, b.good service, but rather for families with children - very many children. The knightly feast turned out to be a kinderbal . In the area there is mainly food and drink for tourists, but no attractions / activities such as sports (windsurfing, canoeing, Lake Ryn no beach). One, a small beach, on a smaller lake (quite nice). One small salad, a small pool for mothers with children. You can do a sightseeing cruise , you can borrow a walking motorboat ( expensive ) , you can get on a small beach to lie down , but generally quite boring is - eat , drink , lie down , look and that much :)"
4407,"The hotel is beautiful and really big, you can get lost. ; ) The food is very good, our company has been very well served in all respects. The rooms are nice, tidy, cleaned daily. It's a pity that the rooms were only left with sparkling water. Besides, it was really great!"
4408,"The only advantage of this hotel is that it is located opposite the main station. A card to the door that I mistakenly opened another room turned out to be not only to my room. Another disappointment was that I got a room with a bathroom adapted for the disabled, which made me very disappointed and I felt very uncomfortable. The hair on the sink and the kettle was so much stone that I asked for a decalcifier, which I rejected from making tea. For 200 zloty a night this is an exaggeration and yet the sight of just a massacre I had room 208 I do not recommend: ( : ("
4409,"This is my second moisturizer. The previous Triad has unfortunately become blurred: / . Humidifier works extremely effectively, copes with a fairly large room. It is not too loud, the quietest is when it works at the highest speed at other settings you can hear a slight buzz. It certainly looks nice on a window sill and here a big plus for design. Very practical is a large water tank, a timer and a humidifier. The display, unfortunately, is misleading because the sensor must be placed near the steam outlet. I could write that this is a perfect humidifier, I could write that I could but . . . . . the steam leaving a mist on the floor and at the highest revolutions a puddle is formed! . To sum up, the last drawback for me disqualifies this humidifier to work in the bedroom unless you have tiles there (but then it is easy to slip) ."
4410,"Has anyone heard the saying that if you pass the wire, you pass the study, and when you pass the layouts, the student knows when he will graduate? Yes, and that's true. Mr. Balik is strange and do not try to talk to him. Here too, you have to put your weight on it. Subject and lecturer are heavy. Lately one has been so good. To pass the subject you only need to count the first circle ( are 2 ) . It is best to pass the first circle on at least 3 or 5 . Then, without talking, the subject will be pushed forward."
4411,"My 6-year-old son and I went to see this doctor for a hearing test. The hearing test was supposed to cost 120 zł, it turned out that only the ear canals were cleaned in this amount, the doctor assured that at the next visit the test will take place and it will cost only 40 zł. After the second visit it turned out that once again there is 120zl to pay despite the reminder that this visit was to cost 40zl. During the second visit we were also instructed to go for another examination this time to the CZD in Międzylesie because of the detected problem with abnormal reaction of the right ear to higher frequencies, on request for a referral, the doctor stated that it is not necessary. Unfortunately, as it turned out CZD will not accept the child without a referral, so once again you have to go to the doctor after the referral, which will probably cost another 120zl, but surely will not make this money the doctor . I do not recommend this office."
4412,"Late in the afternoon we arrived in Suwalki and a previously booked hotel on the route of quite a long journey. We found a new, elegant facility with courteous and competent service and available parking for our car. There was a choice - underground, carefully monitored or right next to the hotel. They chose the first one - it was clean, neat and neat, and the elevator could be used to drive to any floor. The room was well decorated, very clean, smelling of freshness and properly equipped. The beds were comfortable, the linen was nice and new. In the elegant bathroom - cosmetics, comfortable shower, and a toilet and wash basin worthy of the Viley & Boc h (not b"
4413,"Unfortunately, after her return she decided to add her opinion about the hotel for the first time. They spent two nights there with their husband, it was supposed to be a relaxing trip instead of an unpleasant disappointment. she had read me earlier opinions but the purchase was made so we went there. The Jacuzzi - she did not use m at all, first of all dirty, secondly and so only one nozzle works! The terrible smell of chlorine and the smell of breath, as if you couldn't invest in the most ordinary spa fragrance oil. Generally, on the second day, we were considering going home. The food was tasty despite the quality so it was the only plus. I really wouldn't recommend it - great promises, but nothing works, the hotel needs renovating and refreshing."
4414,"The service has been caught up, especially in the bar and reception area. A super beach in the olive grove, where waitresses with drinks and fruit arrive. The choice of food and its quality is very good. Everyone will find something for themselves. Every day, fish or seafood, meat and vegetarian dishes, children's corner. It is worth to choose rooms slightly more expensive in the main building."
4415,"""This all translated into later problems with the functioning of the reproductive system, concerning the puberty and adult period. Female rats were pregnant and had offspring. However, they observed that their reproductive cycle was more irregular than usual. On the one hand, puberty was delayed, on the other hand, the sexual cycle itself became irregular. This means that in the examined rats, compared to the control group, the period during which reproduction is possible at all was shortened,"" noted Dr. hab . Śliwowska . The problems may concern many life processes influenced by hormones: those connected with regulation of the sexual cycle, with getting pregnant, with her reporting, and even with the contact between mother and child."

This is the idea came from taxi driver David Weekes, who equipped his LTI hackney carriage with a foam mattress, quilt, pillow, bedside lamp and even a mascot - Paddington's bear cuddle. The hotel also offers a fridge with solar power, radio, iPad and, on request, camping chairs and a portable table. In the taxi - hotel, which the Wimdu reservation portal offers as Hail - A - Hotel, two rules apply: no smoking and no pets."
4418,"However, the usefulness of the camera is not determined by the resolution of images alone. The authors of the message point out that the main advantage of the device from IBIB PAS is the non-invasiveness of the measurement - the light emitted by laser diodes is completely safe and does not cause changes in tissues. Equally important is the simplicity of testing . It is enough to place a cap with fiber optics attached to it on the patient's head and inject a small dose of contrasting agent into the patient. The examination itself takes only a few minutes and can be repeated many times during the day. What is more, the measuring equipment in the laboratory version, i.e. not yet miniaturized, has the size of a refrigerator. It is mobile and you can go to bed with it even a seriously ill patient treated in an intensive care unit. It can also be used in the operating room."

I did not spill the water in the washbasin by the motion sensor! Reception b. modest, no lobby, no reception on hotel 4 * . It is necessary to improve the organization of check-in and a little more kindness and smile of the staff would be useful. However, I will add that when making a phone reservation Mrs. Eliza was b. helpful and additional services efficiently organized. After one night we received a much larger room, which made a better impression, had a kitchenette and a terrace, but a bathroom. Breakfast was modest. Small swimming pool. A lot of East Germans in the hotel."

Another manifestation of medical treatment is, in her opinion, the existence of internet forums, support groups that bring together patients suffering from certain diseases.

And they enable the exchange of experience and information"" - assessed Dr Wieczorkowska ."
4422,"The standard rooms are terrible, especially on the first floor (our ground floor), musty, mushroom, generally stink. Clothes could not be hung in the closet. . . After the intervention we got a room on the 3rd floor, at least it didn't stink. Apparently in the second wing the conditions were better. The food, terrible, all inclusiv is a failure. All week long one sausage - mortadella not necessarily freshly sliced. . . Ovaries, horrible, look already rejects, the brave tried, found egg shells. . . . . .a lot could still be mentioned here about meals. The surrounding area, generally dirty, on the beach you have to be careful, the ruins of buildings after the landslide, protruding rods and rubble on the beach. I do not recommend staying at this hotel, lost money. Wi - Fi only in the lobby at the reception."

Eric Danziger , head of WHG believes that the introduction of the Super 8 brand in Germany will allow the group to increase its presence on the continent and, in the long term, to expand throughout the EMEA region. In fact, although there were 2,249 hotels with 142,254 rooms operating under the Super 8 brand in December 2011, none of them were located in Europe. Throughout 2011, 75 Super 8 facilities with nearly 6,000 rooms were added worldwide."
4425,"The Doctor was given by a cardiologist who, after doing an ECG showing bradycardia, blocked her thyroid, which was also indicated by all my symptoms. Unfortunately, it was not enough that I was admitted to the office after 15 minutes of my appointment window, although no one was there except the Doctor herself, she did not hear any apologies. All the time she was in the office she felt I was disturbing her because I am, she was impatient as if she was waiting for me to finally go and why do I ask questions. On the basis of the TSH result, she said that I have no thyroid problems or other endocrine diseases. Despite a detailed interview, I feel disregarded. I was not referred to additional examinations until the doctor saw the tears in my eyes. She heard m that it looks more like neurosis to her. I don't recommend it to the Doctor. I'm not recommending her to anyone."
4426,"We went on holiday in 6 people ( 3 pairs ) . After the check-in, which went smoothly, we could easily use the offer of the whole hotel, although our room was not ready yet (we arrived early in the morning). The only surprise for us was that we were accommodated in apartments. Nobody informed us that we could not get a hotel room. The room we got was spacious as opposed to the bathroom. The shower was tiny, tight. Although we are a couple we got a room with two separate beds. At my request to change the accommodation, we were shown a room with one bed but much smaller than the previous one. We decided to stay with two beds. The equipment leaves a lot to be desired (old, worn out). The advantage is the staff, who cleaned the rooms every day and once a week changed the bed linen etc. The food generally tasted good, although nothing special was left in our memory. It was quite varied. From the drinks you can also choose something for yourself (also alcohol). A lot of attractions for children, you can see that the hotel is focused on stays of whole families. Distance from the beach is bearable ok . 5 minutes away. The area is quiet, without any problems you can also get to larger towns (Malia, Hersonissos)."
4427,"In a hotel of this class it is not acceptable that when entering the salt pool the railing is not stable and the second thing is the part that was in the water - joining the tiles with the tiles covered with rusty coating looks uninteresting, the temperature in the salt pool too low after leaving the hot shower And now positive things very nice service clean rooms great food small minus destroyed coasters on which it was good food this note is that it is a very high class hotel and such small things are not acceptable"
4428,"We liked the hotel very much. the food is very good. the service is nice and professional. the interiors are beautiful and with a climate. the pool is large, the water is ideal for swimming. the pool and sauna are open from one hour. 8 . 00rano ! access to the pool and sauna without restrictions and because of that check-out is up to 12 . At 00 00 we could use the pool on the day of departure, and we liked it very much ( !)! We didn't have the feeling that we were being thrown out of the hotel on the basis of ""they were dirty, they paid dirty and now get out"" and this unfortunately often happens even in the best hotels. We will surely still come back here :)"
4429,"There's vermin in the pool - but that doesn't bother you because it's always closed anyway. The children's paddling pool just doesn't have - and it was supposed to be. The rooms in the houses are dirty. At night, there are flocks of shells walking. The bathroom stinks - probably from the sewage system . The large cobwebs in the corners of the room. Notorious shortages of hot water - sometimes quite long. Upon arrival she got a room not prepared by the cleaning crew. She had to push through and wash the paddling pool. The only advantage is good cuisineMonika from Warsaw"
4430,"I wouldn't recommend it because he was very arrogant and passionate. My questions were answered in medical jargon when she asked me to explain the answer she answered that I do not need to know and most importantly that is ok. . . . . She asked me to have the tests done to prepare for the pregnancy - to which he replied that ""once women did not do the tests and it was also good"". Finally, he wrote a referral to a study, but what kind of study it must have been for me to indicate. I was on a visit to DORMED in Strumykowa Street in Białołęka, so maybe that's why he behaved like that, because it was not a private visit. . . ."
4431,"The pictures do not reflect the proper, cluster-like image of the room and bathroom. The technical condition of the bathroom in a terrible state. It is a subordinate dormitory equipped with a good sign. The price for a room over 200 PLN is absolutely inadequate to the conditions. I will never use the stay in this facility again."

They take care of one client in three people, or busy with their affairs pretend not to see the guest. Lack of flow of information about the client's needs (it was difficult to ask for an efficient kettle to the room, because it is not in standard equipment). Lack of information flow between employees. Previously confirmed by phone in May! ! ! ! ! The reservation was cancelled a few days before my arrival (without explanation) and it required three emails from my side to restore it, to my address and in the option I expected. No New Year's Eve atmosphere, the pool is tiny from 1, 2 m deep, there is no information about it at the reception desk and the staff will inform you as they wish. Mini guide received m in English ! During the whole stay the bed linen was not changed, not even mineral water was provided on the last day. Wrong room lighting. Despite the many points, there is really no possibility of reading. The price is inadequate to the quality. I do not recommend . The only positive thing about the stay is the very professional service in the hotel restaurant and delicious nicely served meals."
4433,"Doctors are reluctant to talk about their own mistakes or those of their colleagues, for fear of professional consequences or in the name of falsely understood professional solidarity. However,"" adds the Swiss professor, ""transparency in this area will also benefit the doctors themselves in the long run. ""The main problem is that doctors are not prepared to behave in such situations. This is not only taught by medical studies in Poland, but also in other countries, except perhaps Scandinavia and the Netherlands. This should be changed,"" Cranovsky told PAP. He appeals - together with prof . Romuald Krajewski (Maria Skłodowska-Curie Institute in Warsaw) - to ensure that the proper conduct in the situation of ZN is the subject of induction training for all new medical workers in Poland."

Breakfast is included in the price (Swedish buffet) and there is also a parking lot but it is paid extra. I RECOMMEND ! ! !"

Interesting animations for children and adults . Nice guide and super gondolier ! Professional hotel service . Large hotel with lots of guests not disturbing each other . Generally there is peace and quiet. For lovers of history - the possibility of exploring the castle and the castle castle with a guide. For lovers of astronomy - astronomical séances . Everyone will find something interesting for themselves . The hotel can also be a starting point for exploring Warmia and Mazury. Recommended ! ! !"
4437,"A bad doctor only flies for money. You have to pull every word out of him by force. I feel like he doesn't know anything about medicine at all because every word starts with: ""I guess this,"" ""I guess that,"" ""I guess that,"" ""I guess that,"" ""I guess that,"" ""I guess that,"" I guess I should find out more than he's guessing for 250 zlotys. I already know that next time I will choose another doctor."
4438,"I think you can just rely on Lady Margaret. She calls back, answers e-Mails, informs you that this or that has one or other consequences for the next conversation. It seems so simple and obvious, and yet very often it is not. We communicate via Skype because I am not in Poland. I think that such an opportunity is an incredible convenience for all those who can not directly meet with a psychologist. This kind of communication seems to be everyday life in 2012, but again it is not. Hence the great plus. As to the very essence of the help, actually, a few things Mrs. Margaret has brought to my attention and these remarks are somewhere in my head. I think that miracles are rare and not normal, the psychologist directs, but we really do the rest. I haven't finished my tasks yet. But I know that Mrs. Margaret is out there somewhere and when I need her, she will look at the matter objectively and say what she thinks about her."
4439,"There was a second time I was in that hotel. The first time I was shocked by the reception. Now it was professional. People at the reception desk from a distance had already noticed that somebody had arrived, was served to them at once in a friendly and professional manner. The breakfasts in this hotel are worth praising, as there is a lot of variety and was very pleased with 'em. The restaurant should get a little better (the dishes from the menu did not quite taste good to me, and in addition they were quite modest in quantity). The room was all right. And as usual, a little remark: the Gold status promises a room of a higher standard - but as in all Polish hotels Accor - it has not yet received em ."
4440,"Unfortunately, the doctor is not delighted with her approach to children or her ability to pass on information to parents. A cool person in the paediatric profession is probably a mistake. We went because of the constipation of the son, the first question from the doctor was about constipation in the family, no question about the amount of food, the amount of water, etc. . . The doctor approached the son directly from the keyboard without even putting on gloves. According to the recommendations of the previous paediatrician, which unfortunately we had to change, we use the sudocram to care for our son's bottom because he even burned the linomag. Mrs. Dr. Dr. stated that the sudocrem is a bad idea and that we neglected to pee, even though he was only a little bit dirty with sudocrem, then he then pulled the pee so that he cured in three places. Complete lack of delicacy! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The child started screaming, not mentioning what we had at home. We will never go to this lady doctor again and we will not recommend her to anyone, but on the contrary we will advise against it. A total lack of professionalism. And the doctor said that we have a 7-month-old child to give in every meal of gluten I have come home and that it is recommended to give more gluten than 1 - 2 lyes a day for 10 months. The doctor did not hear my words repeated several times that the little one is an early child. Generally, the visit was very quick and unpleasant, so impersonal. We are compared to how the pediatrician behaves in real life, but unfortunately, we had to change it for the sake of changing the insurance package and we regret it very much. I regret that I had to expose the child to this lady."
4441,"My wife did not want to bother the professor after our visit, as he suggested during my individual visit. The reason was simple. The patient's misconceptional history was only about the time of our marriage, i.e. 22 years of life. There were no questions about childhood, parents' influence, adolescent events, first sex. . . . .fears. . . . religious and other aspects in the process of upbringing and adolescence of my wife and me, and most importantly! feelings between us, trust. . . . .etc. . ! I got 'em some kind of medicine for the long term. Flap. . . I think I'm pretty much overrated a craftsman now riding the wave of successes from years ago . . ."
4442,"First of all, the prices that have been set, which suggest that it is the south of France. So I'm looking forward to these rarities at exquisite prices, and here cheap cardboard juices, low quality sausage, cheese and even coffee not to drink. They would be ashamed to serve such a breakfast, they almost ate nothing. The same with other meals, it is a shame to write. The room was feeling alcohol, I think someone spilled something. The spa in the air is good for scouts, and it's only available inside (if I remember correctly) probably 17-19, and then get out! So wrap yourself up, man, so that you can relax, and run to the relaxing rooms. My husband and I reacted with laughter. The staff is very surprised that someone is surprised at all. The very good location and the beautiful surroundings and the park, but the services offered are just looting! ! ! I would be happy to learn the manager's justification, which is what you are guided by when you propose ""Ladybug minced meat"" for lobster. I will certainly not return."
4443,"After private visits, the doctor referred her son to an almond removal procedure. It all ended well. At the hospital she was afraid to admit to us. Fortunately, everything went well. The procedure without complications was performed by Dr. Gęsicki - it is great! ! ! ! During the procedure ear paracentesis because there was a hearing problem . After the procedure after 2 m - ear inflammation. Hearing problem intensified after 4 m - cach . For the following months the doctor treated catarrhal fever, she saw nothing in her ears except plugging. It is a pity that for a year she did not notice exudative ear inflammation. She found me to SUPER SPECIALIST - maybe much more expensive but after the first visit she found out about the diagnosis and what to do next. There wasn't such a contact as a previouss, but it didn't have any significance. She didn't receive a prescription for rhinitis medication for 100 PLN as the doctor can, only professional help. Besides, she is a nice and friendly person, but I do not recommend as a specialist - FONIATRY! ! !"
4444,"The hotel from outside looks neat and is in the centre near the sea. Unfortunately, the boarding and bars are a big bummer. The bartenders hide behind ridiculous regulations and pour minimum quantities of alcohol. They only spend one cup per person. The toilets stink because the Russians throw used toilet paper into the garbage bins. There are queues everywhere because there are few staff. There is only one person in the bars. There is only one cook in the canteen who fries warm meat and spends it. If you make a complaint to Coral Travel residents they can smile and run away. I had such a case with Mrs. Dabrowska. Despite the option of ultra inclusive is the catering and service and the hotel does not deserve such an exorbitant number of stars and never for five . A week before that came back em from the Armonia Village Holiday Hotel in Turkistree and what he saw 'em in the "" armony prestige "" is the abyss . I wanted to change this hotel to another 5 star hotel nearby but I was offered a large surcharge and even weaker hotels , I wrote em a complaint but Coral Travel all comments denied . As a trip is only with Ithaca as a tour operator never Coral Travel . To sum up, I'd like to add that the next tour forced the arrival of a resident and about 20 people wrote a complaint. I am very happy to read the opinion of other people."

4446,"24 . 08 . 2015 was at the consultation with prof . Colours . Mr . prof . was kind enough to listen to me and analyze the medical records of the RM on 20 July 2015 and the results . . On RM 20 July 2015 a venous angioma was found in the left cerebellum hemisphere. He found that I have a dilated vein. It was based on a comparison with a river as a separate tributary, etc. . . Since 30 July, the condition is still deteriorating so much that several times a week I was taken to the hospital by an ambulance. My eyesight is getting worse [ April 16th , the left eyelid didn't want to close me by itself, I had to close my eyelid with a finger ] I have problems with speech - VOICE LAMP, walking [ I walk about the stick ] imbalance, it is difficult for me to sit at the computer, go shopping, swim, etc . I have nausea, glaucoma, numbness of the tongue often, hypertension , . I'm afraid that such a state will cause not only a stroke but will not let me live normally. The feeling in my legs and hands is getting worse and worse and I am losing strength. It's hard for me to talk for a long time I'm tired, it's hard to stand on my feet and talk. I don't accept a stroke or staying with this venous hemangioma in my cerebellum I want a NEUROCHIRURGIC Surgery - removed VEGETABLE FEEDING INSTALLATION: embolization, irradiation, etc . Mr . Mr. Pawel Kolasa did not undertake treatment if there will be a stroke then the venous hemangioma does not have to rupture first . I am sorry that in the city where I studied mathematics at the University of Łódź and the Polish Academy of Sciences, a prominent medical scientist left me without neurosurgical treatment. I'm 42 years old and I'm too young for such a bad health condition, life in fear or tomorrow morning I'll get up and go to a bus stop or swallow medicines, in case of bad health I won't be able to call an ambulance, call medical assistance and so on.

4447,"This disorder occurs in the bone marrow stem cells, i.e. those from which all other cells can form, in this case produced in the bone marrow. This mutation stimulates the bone marrow to produce an excessive number of immature white blood cells (granulocytes, immune cells), which are more viable and replace those which are normal. This damages the bone marrow and does not adequately protect against infections. When they penetrate the bloodstream, they also damage internal organs such as the spleen and kidneys. 15 years ago, the first drug to inhibit BCR mutation - ABL - was developed, which is key to the development of myelogenous leukaemia. Since then, several other similarly acting drugs have also been introduced. However, over time, the disease may move into the stage of so-called blastic crisis, when a significant number of immature stem cells (blasts) appear in the patient's blood."
4448,"Our short holiday turned out to be a nightmare. We arrived on Friday. To the words ""we have a room reserved here"" the receptionist replied that we did not have, not even asking for a name, and then he turned around and left ( ! ) When he returned it turned out that there is no room for us because all the rooms are already occupied and nothing can be done for us. In the end we got a room in another hotel, for one night. When we came back to Santa Monica in the morning we found out that there is still no room for us but in an hour we will have something for us. Of course it was a lie and we were deluded so all day. The travel republic agency where they booked us a hotel also disregarded us and lied to us that they would do their best and they did not even call the hotel. My nerves let go and she cried like a child. . . Our holidays in the hotel lobby. Everyone's dream. When it started to get dark, the lady at the reception desk (I think you're English) found us a room in a 2-bedroom apartment (20 minutes by car), which we had to share with another couple, who also didn't have a room. It was anyway better than a night on the couch in the hotel hall, which some of us had to share. This woman was the only one who tried to help us all. The rest of the people at the reception treated us as necessary evil and were not very nice. The guests also got on their nerves, there were screams and insults, the police were called several times a day. After a night in the apartment we had to go back again and ""surprise"" there was no room for us. After about 2 hours we finally got a room in this damned hotel. They left us things and we went to see at least how the beach on Mallorca and what a irony, it started to rain. We felt so terribly cheated. . . That's not all. We had to get up for the morning flight, and at the hotel opposite the loud party. Fortunately, they finished it before midnight. But it didn't get any quieter because people were partying on the balconies in the rooms and the acoustics were unfortunately very good. There was neither air conditioning nor a windmill in the room, you had to sleep with the balcony door open and uncovered, and then a neighbour in the room, sitting on the balcony could see us lying on the bed. The bathroom was tiny, a tall person would have difficulty using the toilet, no room for legs. I do not know how breakfast looks like, we did not manage to check it out, but she saw m (and tried m) how the drinks of people with all inclusive (plastic cups with anything), which did not look encouraging. Avoid this place! It's better to lose a couple of zlotys than nerves and holidays ."
4449,"A year ago she started to treat her teeth with the clear aligner method at Mr. Claudius' and I must admit that it met my expectations: ) all the doubts were dispelled during the first visit and new ones disappeared with the next ones. Light, pleasant, but at the same time professional approach to the patient. There were months that the overlays were not made on time, but . . . but with telephone contact NEVER there were any problems. As for the ""permanent"" client, even the removal of tartar had to be done for free - so how not to recommend it? And you can't - so I recommend it with a clear conscience!"
4450,"She was in Kliczków eight years ago and she left me delighted with the quality of treatments in the SPA, varied food, swimming pool equipment with massage devices, cleanliness and after eight years she came to me again sure that my weekend will be as wonderful as the previous one. And what a total disappointment! Spa treatments in addition to the price in terms of quality are at an average level, the food except for breakfast is not very varied and the staff are dissatisfied, you will not smile, the massage equipment is broken and the pool windows are not washed for years. That's how Kliczków looks now, it was my last time."
4451,". . .too much Chinese food. . . It's pretty far away, but if you look at it, you see it's Chinese. New hotel and already a lot of faults. Employees are still learning how to serve customers and you can see that too. Few attractions in the area"
4452,"In the case of biosimilar medicines, the aim is to make the medicine as similar as possible to the reference design - because identity cannot be achieved anyway. ""A biosimilar drug must have the appropriate quality, safety and efficacy - in that order"" - said Professor Spławiński . According to him it is not possible - for ethical reasons - to compare the therapeutic value of biosimilar drugs in large clinical trials. The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector, Zofia Ulz , informed that the institution she manages conducts about 1,000 inspections at a cost of PLN 5 million in various locations (manufacturers, warehouses, distribution) every year. The inspections are also carried out on an ongoing basis by the manufacturers at each stage of production to ensure high, repeatable quality - so that the drug always has the same composition and effect and is free of undesired additives."
4453,"""The lack of importance for the quality and regularity of meals is particularly evident in the case of breakfasts. Some people give up on them at all, motivated by a lack of time or appetite"" - comments research scientist Ewa Jagiełło. ""It seems that the lifestyle they lead is not associated with ignorance, but rather with ignorance of this knowledge and a lack of internalisation of the rules which favour a healthier and more hygienic life - says Dr Ewa Jagiełło . It turns out that the need to take care of oneself often depends on being in a relationship. This is not only about health, but also about hygiene. It is only the intimate relationship that motivates one to maintain it more."
4454,"Part of the project is also the creation of an advanced IT system for medical personnel and patients. It will contain a uniform database of clinical, genetic and molecular data on children with leukemia as well as a patient information portal. The value of co-financing is over PLN 13.5 million. Strategmed is a strategic research and development programme developed by the Council of the National Centre for Research and Development based on the National Research Programme. The document defined the directions of scientific research and development works strategic for the state and defined civilization diseases as the greatest health threat for the Polish population in the perspective of the next years. The list of civilization diseases includes, among others, cardiovascular system diseases, malignant tumors and mental diseases."
4455,"Hello Dr. Paweł Nogal is a doctor about whom you can successfully write by vocation. In the light of current conditions in the service of health, we wish you more of these. He has helped my children Olga and Justyna Pawlak many times and has always been very interested in their health problems, which is nowadays rare. I wish him good luck at work and thank him for everything."
4456,"The nanofibres used by Dr . Urszula Stachewicz's surfaces are a million times thinner than a human hair - their thickness is less than one micron, i.e. from several dozen to several hundred nanometers ) . They are made of polymers - molecules which can be compared to a string with a million pearls. The surface area of such nanofibrous materials is very large in relation to their mass or volume. Nanofibres have been used in medicine for about a decade, among others as a component of dressings and bandages, and even one of the layers of artificial blood vessels. In the future, nanofibres can be used to treat bone defects. And although for now it sounds like a fantasy, the research conducted by Dr Stachewicz from the International Centre of Electron Microscopy for Material Engineering at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow leads to this goal."
4457,"""It's bad, but it was worse. It could be better - summed up by the results of prof . Jacek Wciórka - psychiatrist from the Warsaw Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology . - The efforts of psychiatrists and psychologists are not enough to implement the National Programme for Mental Health Protection. Poles in 70% of cases assess their mental condition as very good or excellent. However, about 30% of them are potential candidates to seek some form of help or support. Although only approx. 23% of Poles declare the experience of personal contact with a mentally ill person, the majority have a fairly strong opinion about such people, as well as about mental illnesses and psychiatric institutions about the characteristics of an unwilling stereotype ."
4458,"I'm a patient of Dr. Simula's. For me he is specific, factual and distant. Such a doctor suits me. Before each visit I am very tense, the doctor always answers my questions, is patient and can explain a given issue calmly. He takes my health problems very seriously. My condition is improving. I am glad to be able to use the care of such a doctor."
4459,"She ordered a room with a bathroom, unfortunately she got a room without a bathroom (general bathroom was available in the hallway). The radiators did not work (and when they worked it was short, so a lot of the stay was frozen m). Walls probably from the dictates (because everything was heard). And terribly noisy (hotel on the street), trams as they drove, everything was shaking: ( I do not recommend : )"
4460,"Total shit and ski-unfire . I can't give up on the fact that 'em came here. 50% more expensive than in Italy, and it sneezes to the power of the entej. The tracks are closed, unprepared, demobilized infrastructure with wooden shirts and trench coat. Just a massacre . I do not recommend to anyone. It will go bankrupt in a few years. Only a few Poles and Russians. Tickets are expensive as hell, and almost everyone has a different owner. You're not going to drive freely. The Turks have no idea about the routes and their preparation. Very narrow routes . Just cry. I warn everyone. The weather is terrible, it blows often and the Turks close the lifts. You lie in a hotel and watch TV or drink vodka because they give you as much as you want for free. This is an incredible mistake coming here."
4461,"If you want to learn something from physics, I recommend that you have a very good guy who is one of the best trainers - you will surely pass, you have to do your best : mrgreen : ."
4462,"He returned 'em to the office after 5 months because of the fall out of the filling made there. I believe that a 180 zloty seal made for 180 zloty should last for at least a year. The Doctor denied that it wasn't him who did it (I have no doubt I had only one such filling on this arch but the dissection was fruitless). Also the surgery earned another 180 zloty, but lost the patient. Apart from this incident, the surgery I judge well."
4463,"An unquestionable advantage of this hotel is the SPA - swimming pool, saunas, Jacuzzi, massage and beauty parlours and the nearby Arboretum in Wojsławice (but not close enough to recommend a walk). The park itself around the hotel is a few trees, uncomfortable surface of walking paths, curved lanterns, tepees for barbecue and courts. Probably a nice place for integration trips, but a romantic getaway - rather not. The apartment is spacious, but decorated like a middle-class hotel room. Nice photo even with ikei and a bouquet on the table would help a lot. Very clean. The beds are connected in the apartment. Uncomfortable mattresses. Restaurant and bar open only until 22 . Poor bar . No bartender ( or someone who can serve drinks ) - if you drink it only whisky or beer . . . Delicious desserts. Nice but not very competent service. Morning Swedish bar decent, though little room for all guests. The restaurant. . . . . . .the richness of the card and the quantity does not match the quality unfortunately . The ""industrial"" fries, too many suits - greens, beef does not knock, grilled camembert with cranberries was delicious, but why give 250 g of cheese and half a kilo of lettuce for an appetizer? ? ? ? A pleasant atmosphere, nice and friendly service. . . . .not bad at all."
4464,"The above (negative) opinion may be discouraging, however, it is worth noting that the doctor has made a factual reference to the accusation, which certainly allows to know the situation from both sides. It seems logical that a referral to a hospital should have a basis (referrals do not seem to be ""just like that"") and that the basis is based on an assessment of the situation - so such assessment and diagnosis had to take place. Personally, after today's visit (the first one), I believe that the doctor has spoken to me in a concrete and professional manner, asking important questions. After he had been introduced to the problem, he explained how to proceed, asking repeatedly if all the issues are understandable. Finally, he strongly emphasized that I can call you on your mobile phone at any time if my health problem is worrying. With a clear conscience I can recommend this doctor."
4465,"Dr Krzemiński is a physicist and mathematician in one ; ) It's very nice to go to this gentleman for exercises (I don't know how to go to lectures - he didn't go to em). Colloquia at the script level, no problem to learn. I think that you can take courses with Dr. Krzeminski without any fear."
4466,"I don't really know where to start. I think I'd be waiting for a confirmation email to . . . . . . .if she hadn't called me again. . . Another case we were promised a room with a marriage bed because we were with a daughter less than 2 years old - of course we did not get one. The lady who took us in promised to explain this and compensate us - of course she didn't get it again! It is a criminal case that the ladies working at the reception do not sign in the emails, they work in the hotel industry and this is unacceptable. The guesthouse does not have a fenced parking lot - the parking lot is called a few places in front of the house. We had a problem because when we arrived there were no more places. The lady told us to leave the car in front of us on the square - after returning from the walk, a warning from the city guard was waiting for us behind the window! The standard rooms are really tiny, not to mention the bathroom. . . . .I guess I could still write but I'm not going to plunge this place any further. I'll just add that we've been walking to the Old Town for about 30 minutes. The guesthouse is located high - I advise against families with prams."
4467,"Generally a clean and standard spa and swimming pool ok . Slides are great for children, as well as animations for children (but rather for preschoolers) and super aquaaerobic and TBC. The benefits given in the booking and on the website unfortunately did not go away with the truth - it turned out that only longer stays have a zumba and a day of healthy cuisine and dansing. The Internet practically did not work at all, which at this level should no longer be a problem at all. The food was ok - varied, pancakes and other fancy foods, but there was no healthy kitchen on a daily basis. Soups creams delicious. Desserts unfortunately to improve . Dried cake, still the same or two kinds of jelly without taste and without fruit. Non-professional service - when she reported me a problem with the benefits Mrs. Manager was amused (she was sent back before she found out that she is not there that day and only she can do it) . She wasn't prepared for any compensation offer. She threw the problem into marketing etc . . . Location of the facility is great - close to the sea, shops, bar and center. The rooms are very well decorated and clean (there was a hairdryer and a fridge), only a little bit tight."
4468,"Very nice, new hotel, beautifully situated by the lake. In addition, it has a well maintained and clean beach and a large park. In case of bad weather you can swim in a clean and decent size indoor pool. The food served during our stay was delicious, both breakfast and dinner. The service was very nice and helpful (with the one exception of a gentleman, who had to be asked intensively to do his duty, whose failure to do so would have burdened our account at check-out). The biggest advantage of the facility is certainly a very large number of attractions and facilities for families with children - outdoor playground, playroom, entertainers, restaurant adapted to serve small customers. I sincerely recommend staying at the hotel to families who want to stay away from the hustle and bustle of life in comfortable conditions. At the end of the day, a teaspoonful of children - in a hotel of this class, it is not appropriate to charge guests a fee of 10 PLN per day of use of the deckchair. I do not know what the hotel is guided by such a policy (certainly not a huge demand from guests for deck chairs, because at least 1 / 2 throughout the day in the holiday season was unused). The price of the base price is more like a lower-standard facility, which compensates for the low base price in this way."
4469,"She bought me a holiday stay here on 23 - 26 December 2016 and I am very sorry. Already on the day of arrival problems began - the rooms are not ready despite the reservation, waiting more than an hour for a room. Dirty rooms, no heating - we got an electric stove. There was a lack of hot water. Christmas Eve dinner was a gloomy joke - there were no tables, incomplete tableware, little staff (for 300 guests). People brought themselves food from the kitchen to eat something at all, small, unheated portions. Some guests left the place - because it is difficult to call it a hotel - the hotel is only in the name. The elevator broke down, the ice rink is closed, you can change it for a long time. And perhaps the worst thing was the arrogance of the owner, who didn't even show up, all the ties gathered staff. Complete guests' spanking. She paid m for something she didn't get m, because the money is collected in advance without problems. They spoiled the people of Christmas, the atmosphere hit."
4470,"The hotel is as recommendable as possible, however, I believe that there are also some problems that need to be solved. The biggest problem is the cleanliness of the room, which is to change towels and bed linen. The lady who does this should not work as a cleaner because she cannot do it. . . For two weeks no one has washed the mirror! ! in the bathroom (which was naturally splashed while brushing teeth or shaving) did not vacuum the furniture in the room! ! The floor on the balcony where we spilled the juice for two weeks was in sticky spots and nobody did anything about it. Your maid didn't even want to hang the toilet paper from the tray, she just put it on the shelf. . . . Moreover, there were a few days when she didn't show up at all (but in total it didn't make any difference to her level of work) The second serious problem is smoking cigarettes by the pool and blowing toxic smoke to the other person who is lying next to her on the lounger, it is not allowed because the addicted smokers burn a lot of cigarettes and the whole day spent by the pool the person is tired of passive smoking . . . . In addition, some guests, especially from the UK, put out their cigarettes directly on the tiles above the pool, so that the ashes and mouthpiece remains fall directly into the pool! ! ! ! The rest of the things are on a good level and I have no objections to food or drinks are OK Waitress service or bar also tries and shows commitment and are nice to guests with a clear conscience I can recommend ."
4471,"I was referred to the allergologist by the paediatrician, unfortunately my visits with my daughter at your doctor's were completely useless - your doctor refuses to issue a certificate for the paediatrician about the allergy, even though he states it. As Bogusia wrote above, I have the impression that the most important thing is for me to come again, although at the visits she does not find out anything new. Also with regard to the dietary recommendations I have a lot of reservations - the results of the allergy tests and the products recommended by the doctor are contradictory - e.g. a frame instead of butter, which supposedly can be eaten safely perpetuates allergies, about which the doctor probably does not know,"
4472,"The hotel is clean and tidy; the staff is already a bit worse, i.e. less competent and less experienced; the tragedy was the large number of cats walking around the whole hotel, which for my several-year-old daughter is murder - I like animals, but in this way it is already an exaggeration. I do not recommend."
4473,The doctor took a lot of time to investigate and solve my problem. She listened carefully to what she was saying to me and received my exact instructions for further treatment. She was very kind to me and I was commissioned to do other laboratory tests. I am very happy with this visit and I recommend that other people take advice and treatment from Dr . Magdalena Baśkiewicz - Noise .
4474,"Hotel Turówka is very well located if you want to go to the salt mine in Wieliczka. The standard plus rooms are large, comfortable and air-conditioned, but they are on the very top which for me is unfortunately not a plus. The bathroom is not equipped with lotion and tissues. The food is good, but the time of waiting for the serving of lunch is a total failure - so long we have not waited anywhere else for the same serving. . . but the taste was good. Breakfast buffet choice at the medium level. The swimming pool is nice, the water is nice but already in Jakuzzi it's a misunderstanding - there you just can't stand the water is so hot. When it comes to spa very nice and nice ladies. Treatments very pleasant and relaxing. To sum up, the hotel is good as a base for excursions, but for me for a longer stay is not necessary."
4475,"Dr. Knight Course - inorganic chemistry - Laboratorial Laboratories Such a nice man with a candle to look for ! ! The classes are stress-free, the assessment can always be discussed - on every laboratory there is an ""input""."

The architects are working on their new decor and arrangement, in line with the trends in interior design, adapting them to the global standards and requirements of the brand. Room modernization This year the brand plans to modernize almost 500 rooms in Poland. The project is focused on the Novotel Warszawa Centrum hotel - this flagship facility is currently undergoing renovation of 249 rooms on 10 floors. Similar changes are taking place at Novotel Warszawa Airport, after last year's modernisation of 40 rooms, another 40 units will be renovated this year.

The library itself, after modernization, does not deviate from the world standard, especially in terms of its functioning"" - emphasized the rector of the University of Lodz. M . prof . Paweł Górski . The metamorphosis that the library building has undergone over the last year consists not only in revitalizing the interior and equipment, but also in giving it new functions. Thanks to the applied solutions, it has become possible, among other things, to lend books by oneself with the help of kiosks, order books to a bookshop, and return them to the launcher and to the shelf for quick returns. There were created zones for individual and group learning. Users have access to desktop computers, self-service copiers and printers. Access to the library part of the building is 24 hours a day ."
4478,"Nice new guesthouse, but the kitchen is trench. Was 'em for Christmas with the family. On Christmas Eve, the food from most of the tables went back to the kitchen untouched. 2 kids and the wife were shaking. When they talked to other pensioners, they also had such problems. Breakfast - a small choice, every day the same and not tasty. And for the lunch included in the price they didn't even give water: ( . . ordered food for the 1st and 2nd day of the holiday and gave what was different than what was ordered. And the owner - asked to come to the table his ass from behind the counter did not move and said that he does not care. The only plus is a nice room and to the slope close, but youh money not worth it"
4479,"Every time I asked, the doctor answered ""I don't know."" She told her what she used to use m ""on her own"" - she prescribed exactly the same thing to me, she didn't look at the skin lesions at all, and for the constant itching she proposed. . . Clobase. Without asking about anything, without proposing any tests - exactly as Eve wrote - this doctor's patient is not at all interested in the next one, please. I'll add that I was with her at 9. 00 in the morning, so I can't make it to the notch of fatigue all day long visits. I strongly advise against it, I'm anyway looking for more. . . ."
4480,"Hello, I have a very nice memory of my stay and I will definitely return to Primavera. She reached m what she came m for - she lost m ! ! The food is very tasty, beautifully served, the waitresses are very polite and kind. Trainers and physiotherapists - professionalism and commitment - rarely seen together. Spa treatments extremely pleasant, wide range, well done. The only attention to the SPA decoration - browns overwhelm and are gloomy. It is good that the renovation is planned. The rooms are tiny, but you can endure. Generally - I will recommend to my friends Primavera, deserves it."
4482,"3 nights in a standard room - unfortunately, we came across an alternative music festival or something like that and there were no better rooms. The hotel is supposed to be in the centre but in fact it is far away everywhere - unless to the Silesian museum - which I highly recommend because of both the collections and the fantastically adapted buildings of the former mine. They also have a bistro with good breakfasts : - ) As far as the hotel is concerned, the area is uncertain and in the evening it is better to return by car or taxi (prices are favourable). The classic rooms were probably recently painted because the traces of paint are on the furniture, the bed and everywhere else. The bathroom has been finished like this from 20 years ago, the shower is tiny. And everything could survive if it was clean, but unfortunately, for the first time in Novotel it was not so - obviously there is a problem with it. The lady for these 3 days did not replenish the bathroom wipes or cosmetics. Everywhere on the floors of both the room and the bathroom was full of hair. As a treat to greetings we received a plate of fruit which we did not eat all of us and so stood poor and mouldy throughout the stay and probably had to leave the room alone. . . In the bed on the mattress, there was no mattress protecting only a sheet at once. . . . . Prices in the bar downstairs are almost as high as in 5 * . Poor as in 4 * and it's in the net. . ."
4483,"Unfortunately, my tests were terribly poor. The speed of writing a large single file to USB 2 . 0 is 5MB / s and does not want to be faster . It does not matter whether NTFS or FAT32 . He bought 'em 2 copies, and on each one such an embarrassment . Shame on the Patriot . The data given by the manufacturer is sucked out of the finger (I understand it is data from USB 3 . 0 , but on USB 2 . 0 should be much better . Plus, when I go to my friend's place to play 2 movies in FullHD in the evening, I have to stay at her place for breakfast to wait for the end of copying. I should ask the producer for a refund."
4484,""" The basic method of thyroid prophylaxis is the examination of thyroid hormones from blood and ultrasound of the thyroid gland. Thyroid ultrasound performed once every two years allows to detect even the smallest changes within the thyroid gland"" - emphasizes Elżbieta Kozik, president of the Polish Amazons Social Movement (PARS), quoted in a press release sent to PAP. For years PARS has been conducting an educational campaign on thyroid cancer entitled ""Butterflies under protection ( www . butterfly protection . pl ) . The basic test helpful in the assessment of thyroid function is the measurement of thyrotropin ( TSH ) - a pituitary hormone which stimulates the secretion of thyroid hormones. In the case of abnormal TSH concentration, it is advisable to determine the level of thyroid hormones in the form of so-called . free (nonprotein-bound), i.e. free thyroxine ( FT4 ) and free triiodothyronine ( FT3 ) . The level of anti-thyrooperoxidase antibodies ( anti-TPO ), which increases in autoimmune Hashimoto's disease, is also assessed."
4485,"Migraines are generally ignored. Many people think they are just ordinary headaches and do not go to the doctor for advice. ""We prefer to take painkillers and sick leave rather than to undergo appropriate treatment that helps every other patient,"" the specialist who also acts as a regional consultant in neurology emphasizes. According to prof . Stępnia, almost 40% . Poles suffering from migraine never reported their ailments to the doctor. And only every second patient has ever consulted a doctor at least once. Meanwhile, the therapy helps to shorten the time of a migraine attack, which usually lasts from 12 to 24 hours. It also helps to reduce the significant deterioration of mental condition during this period."
4486,"I give Dr. Nowak a ""good"" grade. He diagnosed my problem and remedied it. He made ""friends"" with the inserts, which he did obediently and with good results. He taught a few spinal relief exercises and was always, i.e., very consistent with every visit. He repeated to my boredom important recommendations and did not stuff me with painkillers like a family doctor. The fact that he could have given the patient a little more focused attention, but in the end he is so nice and direct that he is forgiven a lot. I trust him."
4487,"We were in it on a family outing and we have no regrets. Very nice and competent service. Quite a rich menu of dishes in the restaurant and more importantly, quite good . I recommend duck with Silesian dumplings . The palace itself may not be a palace to the end, but it looks magnificent. You can see that the owner takes care of details. The rooms are large and comfortable. You can get a little bit attached to the decoration of some, such as a small apartment, but I have the impression that the adaptation stage has not yet finished so that nicer and more useful furniture will just come. Around it is amazing peace and nice views. Breathtaking pool . My son was enchanted. Looks like an ancient cave - dimmed and with climate . My wife ordered some spa treatments and was also satisfied. A disadvantage - no elevator . Well, you can't have everything. I generally recommend !"
4488,"Dr. Kucharski led my 2 pregnancies and in this respect it worked out quite well, but so would any other gynaecologist, because my pregnancies were running properly and without complications. The doctor was nice, kind, witty, although during every visit (and there were quite a few of them) she had the impression that if everything is ok he wants to get rid of me as soon as possible and accept the next patient (because it is known that it is money, money, money . . . . ) . During a few years of my visits he did not offer me a breast examination, once she asked me for it, so with great grace he did the examination. Dr Kucharski also decided that a simple ultrasound examination is not necessary for me at all except during pregnancy. I was surprised when I finally got a solid gynecologist, who discovered a polycystic ovary syndrome during a routine ultrasound. Unfortunately, for many years Dr Kucharski did not associate my symptoms with this disease (e.g. irregular menstruation). All my infections were treated with the same antibiotic, although they were coming back like a boomerang, not even offering me to do the simplest inoculation and adjust the treatment individually to my needs. She lost my trust in him."
4489,"Hotel Azzun is promoted as ""an intimate place with a unique design and atmosphere"". In my opinion, this is not true. First of all, the hotel is located at the BP gas station and nothing spoils the climate as much as the view of the gas station. . . Secondly, the hotel is located on the busy Augustów - Olsztyn route. The hotel, although formally in the Masuria region, is far from the lakes. If you expect a quiet place among forests and lakes, you will be disappointed. The location fits more into a motorway motel for one night. The room - at the price of 250 PLN per one - is disappointing. From the window view of the roof covered with tar paper, small size. Unfriendly atmosphere . I resigned from my stay after the first 10 minutes, for this price you should expect something more. The decor of the hotel itself - which is supposed to resemble Roman thermal baths - is more overwhelming than relaxing. It's neither Roman nor Masurian thermae. This indecision as to the character of the place is its greatest disadvantage. The Roman thermae are best in Czeladz - and it's better to go there if you're a thermal fan. If you're looking for an intimate hotel in Masuria, choose agritourism. If you are looking for a place to have fun with a swimming pool - go to Mrągowo, e.g. Mrongovia Hotel (30 km away), where there is a sports pool, children's pool, slides, bowling etc."
4490,"The hotel offers a great location and I don't mean just a beach surrounded by dangerously looking rocks. You can take the cliffs to the educational path towards the lighthouse, or you can reach the wooden bridge towards the town. The beach is medium crowded at ""rush hour"", everyone will find a place. At high tide the entrance and descent may be problematic (the waves break into rocks). You can find crabs hiding in the rock holes. Lunches and dinners different daily . Breakfast is monotonous, made under the Englishmen and Germans, which is the most there (eggs, bacon, sausages). Delicious oranges at every meal. The salt water pool does not give a chance to ""rest"" from the ocean salt. The pool is normally surrounded by ""reserved"" loungers, although there are clear requests not to do so. Everyday live music, room conditions are great (we had a two-room apartment with a view of the ocean, the kids a smaller separate room). The air conditioning worked perfectly, although from the ocean side open windows / doors to the terrace are enough. There is a car rental service (the cheapest Fiat Panda for 45 EUR / 24h). In the street towards the beach there is a La Mona Lisa pub with excellent pizzas and pasta, a very nice owner and cool old music. It is worth asking for items outside the menu! Attention, closed on Sunday, despite the season. For families with children, who don't need any additional animation, because it's not good enough. It's a waste of time to sit in a hotel and soak your ass in a salt pool, but as a ""home"" to relax after active days of sightseeing, bathing and walking - an excellent choice!"
4491,"Competent , devotes as much time as necessary to the patient without looking at the watch , performs the service at the price of the visit . Unfortunately, in addition - even though she told me that my dad had bladder cancer (which she emphasized m) did not come up with the idea of directing me even for blood tests or to the oncologist to check that the ailments (which was not justified by X-rays or USD) are not due to metastases. And the CT scanner showed an advanced stage of bone cancer. The doctor may not have seen it on the image, but it is a suggestion that it could also cause pain in the buttock or later in the groin. Towards the doctor's learning. ."
4492,Course : Mathematical Analysis II - LECTURE I recommend [ / b ] I had the pleasure of attending lectures on the analysis of Matthew 2 u mgr Merdas . . . . Really very well conducted lecture . . . No unnecessary things. . . Just the necessary theory and examples for it. . . Sometimes there was even a humor in class. . . . . . . That's very cool in general. . . . ; ] I recommend it! ; )
4493,"All in all, lectures with the professor are script transcriptions : ? Exactly definition after definition and graph after graph . In addition, he is often wrong to solve tasks : ? A bad pronunciation - a sleeping, monotonous voice; it does not look at students - rather a window, a wall, a board: lol: And it looks so intimidated; ) A circle - standard tasks from the script, rather simple. The tasks are checked by method 0, 1, 5 (nothing done, something started, correct result). Do not count on you to make any points. If you miss 1 point to be exempted from eczema, he asks for it."
4494,"We were having lunch before the kitchen revolutions and decided not to go back there. However, hoping for good food today, we went, after all Mrs. Gesller was there, and here we are again disgusted. The fish just smelled of silt, it could not be eaten, the service leaves a lot to be desired, the water in the toilet stood, for me it was worse than it was, I do not recommend. It's a pity because we have a close and beautiful place."
4495,"I am very disappointed to stay with my family in this hotel. The service is not competent despite the young age is very spraying and not sympathetic and has no empathy for the customer. There is always something missing in the restaurant from breakfast, e.g. scrambled eggs or bread to room service. I definitely do not recommend this hotel, in the future when going from my family to Wroclaw I will choose another hotel."
4496,"Strokes rank third among the causes of death and are the main cause of disability for people over 40 . Annually, 60 to 70 thousand strokes are recorded in Poland - 30% of them lead to death within the first year. Half of patients suffer from hemiplegia six months after the stroke. Among survivors of strokes, about 70% remain disabled, with 50% requiring assistance and care of other people due to their physical and mental impairment. 29 October is celebrated as World Brain Stroke Day . The 4 simple steps that can save lives are promoted by the association ""Stroke victims - support counts"" ( www.udarowcy.com.pl . ) If we suspect a stroke in someone, just ask him to smile, say a simple sentence and raise his arms. Stroke does not allow you to smile - on the affected side the corner of the mouth falls down. Saying simple sentences and understanding speech are difficult, and raising your arms is impossible or possible to a limited extent. If any of these symptoms occur, call the emergency number immediately."
4497,"Stinky Executive room, prepared for one person, despite booking for two. Change of room after discussion with the reception staff, who was very rude. Only the bar and restaurant staff was polite."
4498,"Yes: very good hotel, nice service, good food, delicious coffee, clean, my room was comfortable and tidy, cleaned daily, in the bathroom every day enough towels and hygiene products, everything worked efficiently: lighting, blinds. No. Due to the location of the hotel and my room, after opening the window, the noise coming from the street was heard."
4499,"Despite the unfavorable reviews, the hotel has proven itself. I'm sure I'll come back to it travelling after midnight. Location away from civilization in a beautiful area . Silence and tranquility . The palace itself has a unique charm. Yes, it is ""aged"" and you can see a lack of care for certain elements . . . Nevertheless, a wonderful service, thanks to which you can feel really special, tasty dishes and enchanting views. . . . .in my opinion, they make up for everything. A wonderful fireplace, beautiful rooms and delicious wine make you move in time. I understand other people's objections, but you have to look the truth in the eyes it is a unique and real place. Feeling that something happened in it, some story took place, is mysterious and slightly scary. . . Maybe that's why it has its charm and not at all deterred by some minor inconvenience. If I was expecting a butler and a spa, I would probably choose a hotel in the centre of Szczecin or another city with a correspondingly higher price. It is a special place and because of what kind of hotel it is and by these people, thanks to whom this place teems with life Palace is unique. If someone needs to rest from the city, spend a romantic evening and sink in time it is an ideal place. I recommend it!"

Besides, the sound of the average starter to throw away (poor quality can not be listened to) for a large price as for such a phone I send for a guarantee with the possibility of cash back"
4501,"Luxury only appears in the name of this object. I don't know how this place got 4 stars, but I assure you it is an ordinary mountain guesthouse. Already during the reservation of the New Year's Eve stay gave a feeling of roughness, but decided to give us a chance tempted by the award of luxury brand of the year. We were greeted with information how much we paid in advance how much we still have to pay and a request for a credit card in the presence of other guests . . . Before we were shown the room. . . . . Our first room was so small that when we unfolded the suitcase, we couldn't get through. The ventilation in the bathroom did not work and the bathroom door did not close. O 7 . At 00 a.m. I was woken up by a child running around the corridor because the rooms were not quiet. Unfortunately, we also had the unpleasantness to listen to all the discussions of our neighbors and, I suppose, our neighbors as well. The room was exchanged for another one - the one you couldn't complain about, although there was still a shortage of wardrobes, TV and fridge did not work. We didn't want to keep running to the reception and asking for repairs. SPA - has nothing to do with SPA. The dry sauna - so designer, that there is nowhere to sit. During our 6-day stay, we set it up heated up to 60 degrees. The showers belonging to the sauna had hot water. The handles in the sauna are metal and wrapped in a piece of skin. In the wet sauna there was standing water ( ? ?? ) . We could not find the brine. It is empty. The massage was ok, but trying to make an appointment for it required a lot of commitment on my part; because the lady from the reception desk said that she does not understand the spa schedule :) I was also supposed to receive a confirmation of the time by phone. . . She had to call me herself. The cleaning took place only at 3 pm. 00 . Cosmetics were not a trussardi company, as the hotel advertises on the site, moreover, my partner and I received a bottle of gel & shampoo to use together. Parking is also a misunderstanding. There wasn't enough space, the guests had to pawn other guests, and the pawning also happened to the staff. We were pulling out of bed to move the car. The strong point of Noname is the kitchen and restaurant service. Strolling around we could still hear other guests complaining about falling shelves, lack of light bulbs, cold water in the shower and smoke in the room. We felt a little bit like intruders, because although the staff, especially in the restaurant, tried to make it as convenient as they could, some things couldn't get over. At farewell, the lady at the reception desk was very obstructive, and the comment on fb was removed. I wouldn't recommend it. We won't come back."
4502,"Very good doctor. From a very young age I was struggling with a strong cough and dyspnea, I went to many doctors where nobody could tell me what was wrong and finally I went to this doctor and I must say that the medicine he gave me and it was the inhaler that helped me and cured me, not only did he help me and my mother, who had detected allergies and helped my grandmother, who was lying in the hospital and had lung problems and detected water in her lungs, so he really valued this doctor because he really is experienced and knows his way around. . . . .and he's a very nice and cheerful man: )"
4503,"Unfortunately, the opinions about this hotel published on the website are true. In a few words - dirt, stench and fungus. . . The photos of the hotel and its surroundings, which were posted on the hotel's website, are no longer valid. They must have been taken years ago and nobody has the courage to update them. Upon arrival, it turned out that the rooms are not assigned to the guests who are to appear on the day. I spent a good 15 minutes at the reception desk before the staff found a room for me in their hand-written notes. Then it was just worse. A dirty room with an unpleasant smell . Bathroom's fungus. . . . . And all that food of very poor quality. . . . . I longed for my 2-day stay to come to an end. She could only recommend this place if, in these conditions and with this quality, the price for a night would drop to 30 - 40 PLN. Additionally, I would like to point out that the deposit is not an advance payment, charged by the hotel when booking a room, in the amount as high as 50% - this should give a lot to think about. . ."
4504,"FM radio on the integrated antenna is not working properly. After contacting the official Kruger & Matz service, I have been informed that I can change this antenna myself and end up with an FM socket. Unfortunately, the service either does not know how to do this or due to lack of respect for the customer did not want to give this information. In a word, em was sent to a tree and left with their problem. To sum up, I sincerely discourage you from buying any of the equipment of this company, because in case of a breakdown you will probably be informed that you have to fix this equipment yourself."

4507,"As it seems, the owner - Bieszczady Shelters and PTTK Hotels, can get for a facility with 70 rooms and two apartments, the amount of several million PLN. So far, the value of the transaction on the Polish hotel market is not expected to exceed or at least come close to the level of 2013, when, according to Jones Lang LaSalle company, it amounted to over 113 million euro. Since the data of Jones Lang LaSalle company do not take into account the turnover of smaller hotels with a value of not more than a dozen or several dozen, but several million or even several hundred thousand euros, between - above all - domestic entities, taking into account that such transactions ""Hotels"" recorded more than 30, the total value of the Polish market of purchase and sale of accommodation facilities in 2013 can be estimated at 150 - 170 million euros. In the last year, the value of the Polish market for the purchase and sale of accommodation facilities in 2013 can be estimated at 150 - 170 million euros."
4509,"A modern hotel located in a quiet area with facilities offering luxurious holiday apartments, in the vicinity of a golf course and a congress centre. Spacious rooms decorated in a modern style with a large balcony equipped with garden furniture. The hotel has several restaurants and bars, well-developed close proximity to the surrounding area with a palm tree planted enclave where evening music events are held in the season. The service is cordial and always helpful. Catering in the form of a rich buffet and dinner enriched with live cooking. A footbridge leads to the beach (the gate opens with the key to the hotel room), which joins the sect of footbridges stretching along the coast (attention protected area - saw with her own eyes the snake sneaking between the vegetation? ) . The beach is long and sandy, to the characteristic and picturesque rock formations of the Algarve coastline walking along the beach to the west about 4 . 5 km . The hotel is perfect for walking enthusiasts and those who prefer to avoid the bustling holiday centres."
4510,"A lot of traveling, it's not a 4 * mistake. Breakfast is weak, rooms that standard 2 - 3 star hotels. I would definitely advise you better pay up and have a hotel really 4 *. Medium location. Clean and tidy is one of the few advantages. Generally I do not recommend"
4512,"Building : There are two buildings in the centre. The first one, the main one, is after renovation, with spacious rooms of the standard that was presented in the offer. The second house (unfortunately, we spent the night there) is an older object and of a significantly lower standard: tight rooms without balconies, beds inserted ""for the amount"". so there's no way to turn around, besides the rooms haven't been cleaned for a long time (dry trampled cherry on the floor, shower cobwebs, cobwebs, not washed and not sweeping the floor for a long time. . . ) WIFI is only available at the new facility, so every time you had to go there to be online. For three days the router did not let you connect. With other problems: in the old building in the evening the power was switched off - you had to turn on the fuse, which anyway after a while ""popped out"". It is hard to say if too much equipment was turned on at the same time or if the installation was damaged during our stay. It was a bit cumbersome. The area: great facilities for small children - trampoline, toys - organized in the form of a playground. Parking on the premises - on green grass, gate closed for the night. Service: very nice, mostly made up of young people. Eating: breakfast in the form of a Swedish table, no option of eating something warm for breakfast, such as sausages or scrambled eggs. Pretty little diversified and monotonous breakfast menu, may get bored after 3 days of stay. Two-course dinners, tasty soups, second courses are also ok. Coffee, tea, cocoa and bread, lard, white cheese and jam are available throughout the day (in the main building) - a very cool option. I recommend accommodation in the main building."
4513,"I'll be honest with you, I don't understand why you're so excited. Monika is really nice during the visit, I admit that she prescribed me the appropriate medication for the most typical female ailment, but during the examination she had the impression that she wanted to finish it as soon as possible and had to ask me to look at my other ailment and then she said that there was something wrong and recommended the appropriate examination. When I asked her questions, she felt like I was disturbing her and I was a pain in the ass, which I can't say about the other doctors she was visiting."

Lewin - Kowalik . Scientists are investigating, among other things, the possibilities of using soil cells, which have already been successfully used in patients with damaged spinal cord. ""They tried to induce regeneration or prevent the death of retinal ganglion cells by giving them the possibility of contact with peripheral soil cells - Schwann's cells and it turned out that it does them very well.

The restaurant always clean has never lacked anything, the choice of dishes will satisfy you, meat all kinds of interesting flavors sometimes surprising, pure Greek dishes musaka filo pastry with various fillings, casseroles lamb rabbit chicken turkey the chef sliced and this leg of alcohol duck whole and the salad bar was never empty and the cheese hmmmmmm. The pools are clean two deep you can swim in and one for children shallow, with sun loungers rather not a problem although it was worth putting down a towel to have an umbrella for shade! Bars two but one open to 23 and here a small problem because the queues and one of the bartenders a bit whimsical but . . . . . . .but in a smaller bar by the pool for children named Eleni, always smiling and busy, it was nice to sit! ! !

4517,"The Doctor is my role model for the perfect doctor. She has been treating me for a few years and every visit to her has recharged me with optimism and good energy. In my opinion it is full professionalism, deep knowledge and what is important she finds time and willingness to share at least a fraction of this knowledge with the patient so that he or she is aware of why such treatment and not others, why it is necessary to change his or her lifestyle, nutrition, etc. Thanks to such an approach I have full confidence and conviction in the exemplary medical care of Bardej, which I experience, which is probably also not without significance for the treatment. Moreover, in my opinion, the Doctor takes into account the overall condition of my health when treating me by ordering appropriate control tests, examining during the visit, etc. At the same time, a unique culture and even gentleness in relations with the Patient. Thank you very much for all this Doctor Annie! To all those interested I recommend the care of the Doctor. Mirosław Oleński ."
4518,"Shortening the tedious and lengthy process of discovering a new drug will make it possible, for example, to use the old, already known drug for a completely new purpose. This is what the team led by Dr Monika Marcinkowska intends to do. ""Recently, our colleagues from the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw discovered that the well-known sleeping drug zolpidem, administered to experimental animals in very small doses, has an antipsychotic effect,"" explains the researcher. In rats, psychosis symptoms can be caused by administering appropriate substances such as amphetamine. ""The animals are then put into a state of hyperlocution. Then the test substance is administered - in this case zolpidem - and the effect of reversal of hyperlocomotion is tested. These are standard pre-clinical tests, which are performed to assess the effectiveness of a potential antipsychotic"" - explains PAP Dr Marcinkowska ."
4521,"The location is undoubtedly one of the greatest assets of this place - within the center of the place we can reach everywhere quickly even on foot. The room is a bit small, but with a bathroom in the room, which other hostels may envy. Sockets at human height (no need to crawl under the bed or bend over the wardrobe to charge the phone). The bedside lamp (it's a pity that it's only on one), flat screen TV on the wall, wardrobe with lots of hangers, bedside lamp by the bed. With a clear conscience I find that this hostel could be a peaceful hotel - up to three stars are missing only to polish up a few small details (such as towels, mini-sets for bathing), mineral water and these lamps. At the owner's place I would take a look at the hydraulics - the only thing that bothered me was the sound of neighbors taking a shower - you can hear the water flowing terribly - maybe it's just a matter of changing the batteries. Breakfast is unfortunately on your own (kitchen available), a few steps away, on Wieniawska Street, but you can have a decent breakfast in a nice atmosphere. Whatever you say, let's not forget that the price is incomparably lower compared to the hotel ;) Very attractive. The reception desk (except for the fallback with Mrs. Anna) is very competent. We have been provided with all possible informational assistance, you can feel at home or at the place of good friends. General, final positive impression. If I am in Lublin again, I will certainly return there. I greet the team and thank you for your hospitality."
4522,"I advise against it, I strongly advise against it. I went to it a year ago, maybe something has changed since then. Anyway, not only that the order of admission is arbitrary, but also the waiting time - usually she waited more than 40 minutes for the party (once when she waited for an hour she just came out of the door slamming the door), with Dr . There is no contact outside the office, and the psychiatric specialty, in my opinion, requires it, it seems that he is testing his medication on patients, he does not explain anything in fact, his alleged ""hypnosis"" is some kind of fun. He did not pay attention to most of the ailments that I told him about, he wrote down medicines that either did not give anything or after which he had the impression that they would kill me - she had a severe allergic reaction (""no no no no, then take it for a month if we do not think about it""). And his relaxed and lanser style is pathetic. From-- ra-- thank you, a waste of money, time and health."
4523,"In the summer, the construction of a three-star hotel for the ""famous international chain"" is to begin in Wroclaw on Traugutta Street. The building, whose investor is a real2b development company, will be built opposite the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel currently under construction. The planned facility will have over 130 rooms. The total area of the facility is nearly 6 thousand square meters, distributed over seven overground storeys and a garage. The investment is to be completed in approx. 18 months, which means that the opening of the hotel for first guests is expected at the beginning of 2016. The plot on which the Wroclaw hotel will be built belongs to one of the shareholders of Real2b - Marek Falenta. The company announces that it is looking for new plots of land for such facilities in the largest Polish cities."
4524,"A very competent, kind doctor. She explains everything in detail, does not exert any pressure and what is very important - she does not draw the patient - which is quite common in this industry. The most difficult defects are corrected at the Doctor's in 1 or 5 years at most, while at other orthodontists such a period is given by phone as a minimum, without looking at it or even asking about the level of defect. This only means that Mrs. Silence is an honest, effect-oriented, not profit-oriented person, which is unfortunately missing from most other doctors in this profession. I recommend it! ! !"
4526,"Too high price of the visit in comparison to the help offered to the patient . 250 PLN for a regular laryngological examination and ordering an additional diagnostic examination in another place is definitely too high price . The doctor should be able to adjust the price of the visit to the extent to which he helped the patient, many doctors propose to reduce the price of the visit if it did not give anything, because the results of additional examinations are needed."
4527,"doing what any one of you does with the script. And that would be okay, but it just makes mistakes. It's funny - he says himself that if we have chaos in our heads, it's better not to write anything. Sometimes there's a funny thing as he wrote down both boards with the task, and there are funny mistakes along the way. One more thing - if he's wrong, and there's a bit of laughter in the hall, it starts to turn and everything starts to turn. In contact with the student he is either indifferent - if he has no right to add anything from himself, if he can be a bad guy and he is a terrible boor. It is not so tragic, he will pull a point, one and a half, pass in circles. When he can show a good guy it's crazy, he's going crazy."
4528,"Breakfast at the hotel was very poor, there was a lack of bread and nobody cared about it. No parking at the hotel, they were sent back to the car park in the shopping mall. The hotel is huge and there are few lifts, I waited for the lift 15 minutes at breakfast time."
4529,"I am after 4 visits to the doctor's office and after a gradual change of medication, all my previous ailments disappeared and I find it hard to believe. The doctor is very nice and cheerful, although at the beginning she looked very serious, she is just focused, just like somebody else has been hanging out here, it's true. She's a mobilizer for health. I came to 'em first time and I was very stressed because the results were very bad and now I'm a different person. I feel like a healthy person now, although I know I have to follow everything he says exactly. He's a great specialist."
4530,"Hello, I have been to your doctor with my daughter a few times (now she is 11 years old), once it happened that the diagnosis was correct, but the last two times your daughter was coughing, the last two times she was coughing, the last time she had a phlegm on the back of her throat, and it lasted about 2 m - and this time, unfortunately, twice, she made a diagnosis of riflux (you prescribed Dr. Bishop. This time, unfortunately, twice he made the diagnosis of riflux (you prescribed Dr. Dr. Reflux) and then I was not fully convinced to this diagnosis I went to a great pediarist specialty allergologist and found that she has wedge-screen sinusitis after the administration of antibiotics, everything went away. So I have a question what kind of laryngologist is he?"
4531,"Studio Mouzaikis family business of great people . A quiet place, tasty food, prices suitable for food which is very much (very tasty). The rooms are clean (you clean daily). The rooms are not comfortable, but believe me, they are important in such an interesting position. The studio is only 7 minutes from the beautiful sandy beach. . . ( of course, infantry ) . The beach is very long, reaching the neighboring town of ALYKAS and has many water attractions. Studio Mouzaikis is located in the very quiet village of Alykanas, do not count on parties from evening to morning, a great location for families with children. . If we were to go back to Zakynthos it would only be to Alykanas to our friends running Studio MOUZAIKIS and the LEVANTE tavern. . . ."
4532,"Typical family hotel. Spacious apartments, with a kitchenette, on a high level. Always thoroughly cleaned. The beach right next to the hotel, the only downside is that it's public, but in Bulgaria it's normal. The hotel is in a very quiet area, great for walks with children. 10 minutes walk from the hotel village with lots of restaurants and shops. About 30 minutes on foot or 10 minutes by bus to the centre of Tsareva, a small town, but there are souvenirs and amazing views of the rocks. . . The park, restaurants, what more do you need. The food is very good, especially breakfast, where everyone will find something for themselves. Children never go hungry. The hotel deserves a perfect score thanks to the animation. This year, for the first time there were Polish animators for children and I hope they will still stay there so that I can return with my family. Animation for adults at the highest level. Mass of classes during the day, conversations in virtually every language (the group learned bravely Polish!), and in the evenings a great show (especially dancing - the highest level that she saw m, and was m in many hotels! ) . I recommend it to families with children."
4533,"Being at the training in Tarnow he was assigned to this hotel. It took about 30 minutes to collect the room key! ! ! They asked us for a room for two people. There was a room with a double bed available. We were very happy to have a room for two people. However, it turned out to be a delusion, the gentleman at the reception desk deliberately made us angrily and co-opted us into a room for 4 people. And a room with a bedroom bed gave us one to some Lord. The peak of insolence in a word, and yet we were asked so nicely. . ."
4534,"Hotel Incekum West 4 * met expectations - the location of the hotel is very interesting - a small sandy beach in the hotel area, access to the sea from a wooden platform and ladders provided the opportunity to enjoy the charm of sea bathing. The hotel's swimming pool is not too big, but for those who do not like sea bathing it is enough. The number and availability of deckchairs and umbrellas is sufficient, there were no problems with finding a free and convenient place to sunbathe or hide in the shade. The beach equipment was also available for hotel guests on a separate piece of sandy city beach. There was also a distributor with cold drinks and water available for guests. High level board 3 meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) in the form of buffet with a large selection of main dishes and appetizers, salads, fruit and cakes; and 1 meal in the form of hamburger snacks, fries and the so-called ""cookie hour"" during which cookies and cakes were served at the bar. Quite a lot of places at the tables in the restaurant and the bar. It was possible to book a table for dinner. The hotel room was modest but neat and regularly cleaned - daily toilet cleaned, towels changed every other day and bed linen changed twice a week. The hotel staff is very friendly despite problems with English language skills. The only disadvantage of the hotel is the lack of evening entertainment for adults, after the animation for children in the form of mini disco there was no animation or disco for adult hotel guests."
4536,"Welcome In September this year we had a wedding at the Belweder Karpacz Hotel. Mrs. Magda helped us to organize the party, we paid 245zl per person overnight, as you know we established the menu, everything went with a plan we trusted Mrs. Magda and our mistake that we did it tables were almost empty portions as for birds! We wanted something effective to make it have its charm, Mrs. Magda offered us a burning shish and then shoves. The event was scheduled for 3 at 2 o'clock, neither pork knuckles nor a trace of our witness went to ask for the pork knuckles, they were served on plates of course in a mini version of almost cold 3 pork knuckles were placed on a small plate. This is a person who is greedy for every goldenrod, please face it and I do NOT recommend this place to anyone! ! ! Besides, she treated our guests disrespectfully, she wasn't nice and she made one of our guests pay for the coffee, the peak of rudeness and prudence."
4537,"The hotel can be reached in 5 minutes by tram from the railway station and by bus from Nantes airport. Good location in the city center, close to many shops, restaurants, shopping center. The decor of the rooms is very modest (like the ibis). Free wifi in the room. For little money you can buy breakfast."
4538,"I was sent to my doctor in the absence of my attending doctor, half pregnant. The pregnancy proceeded properly, my doctor had no objections to the results of the tests, and in Dr. Babik's case she heard that I was about to go to the hospital with such results of urine (slight deviations, it turned out that she kept the sample wrongly), additionally she scared me that I could miscarry because I have cramps (which, as it turned out from 20tc. may happen, the doctor when asked me about such a thing did not hear about it). Also, I was only afraid and these few visits cost me a lot of nerves, and I think that pregnant women should be spared this."
4539,"Hello, the manufacturer on the packaging clearly suggests that the device is very precisely measured. Unfortunately, with this thermometer you can at most check if the chicken has already thawed. It is definitely not suitable for measuring the temperature in a child, especially in the pre-febrile states. I bought this thermometer in Legnica in a shop at 37/38 Mickiewicza Street. The seller claimed that he had no complaints. They bought it because a child 10 months old had a fever. Unfortunately, despite the measurement according to the instructions, the subsequent temperature readings within 1 minute differed by 1, 5 oC to 2 oC . This is far too much dissimilarity considering that for a child with an infection 36 , 6 and 38 , 6 is a huge difference . After calling a doctor with a touchless thermometer it turned out that the child has a fever. I advertised this toy thermometer demanding a refund."
4540,"Hello! She's heard a lot of good things about the doctor, but I don't know where he's taking him in Zielona Góra. I ask someone kindly to give me the address of the doctor's admissions. And if possible, the phone number to him. I care very much about that and thank you in advance."
4541,"- Nearly one third of American and Canadian tourists (32% and 31% respectively) see business trips as an opportunity to get to know a new city or place, while for Chinese travelers it seems more important to get to know and use a higher class hotel. For travelers from Brazil, on the other hand, a business trip is an opportunity to take advantage of everything that a paid trip offers. - Business travel is the biggest problem for UK residents; as much as 38% of the country's citizens do not like it or see it as a sacrifice of personal time and time spent with their families. - Nearly half (46%) of all business travellers have extended their travel to leisure time in the past, while a quarter (25%) always ""organise"" some personal time for themselves when travelling on business. - One in three business travellers (33%) find it important to visit a hotel and get to know its offer."
4542,"Hello, so what if you buy an oven for 999 PLN (about 1000 PLN) if after a short time the inner pane is broken, which can be replaced by amica service for about 300 PLN, this warranty does not cover because it is treated as a matchmaking damage, and the truth is that with the third or fourth use of this oven and after heating to about 200 degrees C, with an empty oven (I mark PUSTYM) and after opening the oven door the pane is broken into a small flour. From this I realized it is not an isolated case, if it wasn't for this WADA I judge this equipment for good 4 stars"
4543,"Very thorough, patient, in no hurry, individual approach to the patient, although I have the impression that it does not answer enough to the question (it may have been about the ambiguity of a given situation) the office and the environment itself raised some doubts due to the conditions, but it hindered professional service. I generally recommend and choose again."
4544,"My friends and I went to a hotel for the weekend. As a person without a couple, I had a single room. The weather was ugly, the outside was cold, the room was completely unheated. After the radiator was opened, not much has changed because of the very high room and the small radiator. The swimming pool area - a failure. The pool was icy, the jacuzzi was barely warm - we found out that the day before there was a breakdown, but nobody informed us about it, nor did they offer a discount after the fact. Dinner - 70 zloty - quite tasty food - coffee / tea additionally paid (shock!). I live abroad every day, such things do not take place, especially since the price with breakfast is 350 zl. As for the object (just a cold room) I have no reservations, the reservation system also works efficiently. The spa treatments were also pleasant, of course paid for on their own. To sum up, I will never decide to come to this hotel again."
4545,"I am impressed by the commitment with which Ms. Olimpia does her job and treats every patient. Before the planned birth we met with Mrs. Olimpia at the Siemiradzki Hospital and then she told us exactly how to prepare for the birth (what exercises to do, what to pay attention to, when going to the hospital, what to take away, what will be the role of the husband during the birth, etc.). ) . The message was understandable and uplifting ☺ Although it was my first pregnancy and I was very afraid of giving birth, she knew I would be in good hands and everything would go well. Being in the hospital she felt well taken care of and safe - Mrs. Ola kept telling me what she was doing, what the situation looked like and how it translated into the course of the birth - what are the progresses, whether it will hurt more ..., whether it is worth anesthetizing, how to minimize the feeling of pain, How to practice on the ball ... Because at the end of the birth there was a risk of complications, the team at the Hospital decided to terminate the pregnancy with a caesarean section so I was not allowed to wait for the final and with the support of Mrs. Ola to give birth naturally. But now I know that thanks to her experience and good communication with the whole team everything ended well and the decision to have a C-section was made at the right time. Then Mrs. Olympia visited us still in the delivery room to make sure that everything was fine; I admit that she felt as if my beloved aunt ☺ had visited me then."
4547,"When planning a long trip, she was thinking about whether to go to Novotel City West or Novotel Centrum. I must admit that the criterion was the price. Despite the initial problem with the room, which was quickly solved the whole stay I consider very successful. A very pleasant surprise was the hotel staff (from the reception staff, restaurant staff, swimming pool staff and service room), I admit that the best so far in the entire hotel chain of the Accor Group, and we have already used different brands during family trips with sisters. From the very beginning, the kids were welcomed nicely with a small gift, and later on they could use the children's playground without any worries or remarks, even the evening craziness in the restaurant did not meet with ostracism ; ) . For us parents, the evaluation of the hotel is the satisfaction of children, and they did not want to leave it: )"
4548,"We bought the stay from a group, of course the decision was based on the proposed offer and a relatively low price. On the spot it turned out that there is no one inside, we waited for a moment until someone comes, and we wrote us an email about which we will be. Finally, we called the number that we had on our side, because the one at the reception did not answer. Finally the lady from the staff came and took us to the room. It was cold in the room as well as in the whole guesthouse and it was raining and we wanted to get warm. The room was quite spacious, but the beds were connected to the wooden finishes every night. TV did not work, WiFi also had a terrible range, saved us the Internet on the phone, the bathroom was well taken care of, single tiles on the floor were moving. The kitchen was small, but we did not go there to cook, although the availability of pots allowed us to make mulled beer with juice. The sauna was not used by us, because we visited the hotel Gołębiewski, located 5 minutes from the guesthouse. Breakfast was the same every day, alternating with hot meals with sausages and scrambled eggs, plus a tasty fresh bread and strawberry jam. Karpacz is beautiful, but if you come back to the same place again it is definitely a different guesthouse. Greetings to all those relaxing in the mountains!"
4549,"Not bad at first sight. Reception, lift service Ok . However, on the third floor smells of fumes from the kitchen as if the pipe from the kitchen hood ends up there and not on the roof. Room's cool. The restaurant is very weak from service to the kitchen."
4550,"In 2013, year-round tourist accommodation establishments made up 68% of all tourist accommodation establishments. Traditionally, the largest number of beds was offered by hotels - 208, 6 thousand places, which accounted for 31% of the total number of available beds as of 31 July 2013. The largest number of units - 3,349 - was found in the group of facilities with no more than 25 beds and in total they included 54,600 beds, i.e. 8% of all beds."
4551,"She was supposed to stay at home but she didn't even ask for care and she didn't write a prescription. It seems that the patient has to ask for it himself and ask only how he should know what is necessary at the moment. I am not satisfied with this visit, I give a neutral assessment because I hope that the diagnosis is correct. With the child zero talk ."
4552,"Hi, I just got back with my family from the Calypso Hotel. The hotel is generally clean by Bulgarian standards. The room with the extra bed had us big. Furniture destroyed. Big beds but mattresses lying down, uncomfortable. A child slept on a sofa bed. In the evening it was terribly dark in the room only a few halogens at the entrance and near the bed. From the bathroom there is a smell of sewage system. The hotel is located near a busy street and it is better to choose rooms with a view of the Palazzo Hotel. What was the worst thing about the hotel was the boarding. We had the option All - inclusive. Breakfast is a failure and the largest with bread a few bread rolls and bread and toast probably the cheapest possible. Daily scrambled eggs, planted eggs and hard-boiled eggs. There were two sausages. Besides, beans. The meat is worse than our cheapest mortadella. Fruit and vegetables to every meal - it's a plus. Coffee and drinks from the machine not to drink . As for other drinks it is tea and cherry, apple and grapefruit juices had a very strange taste. Only in the coffee corner of the vending machine you can drink the original fanty, sprite, cola and so on. In addition, water from vending machines without limits. Lunches and dinners with this were different. Better than breakfasts but not perfect. Always potatoes toasted or french fries for that some meat in sauce mostly chicken. Several times there were fish and often fillets in the coating (such fakes of our Frosty) . From 15 spikes in the pool bar, always fries and muffins, once fried cheese in a breadcrumbshell. Some cakes and fruit. From 10 in the pool bar, ice cream and spirits. The bartenders do not save on spirits. I recommend a drink called Tropic. Pool clean in the morning you can see on the steps of undissolved chlorine in granules water colder than in the sea . Unfortunately, deckchairs occupied early in the morning . The lifeguard even though present is still looking at the phone . When it comes to animation, there was no failure . Two animators . Every day 30 minutes . with songs for children for adults was also something . Once a Bulgarian evening, once a karaoke . There is also a small children's playground near the pool. To the sea I recommend to get between the hotels across the street at the main exit of the hotel. It is closest to the wooden footbridge and at night the lighting. I recommend the safe in the room paid for a week 30 BGN. Money is best to have Euro and exchange it at the hotel exchange office for day 28. 08 . 2018 1 Euro - 1 , 90 BGN . In a bank 1 Euro - 1 , 955 BGN but you have to have queues and ID card with you. To sum up, you can find a better hotel in similar money."
4553,"The owners are the Rude Fraudsters! ! ! They cancelled my reservation without a word of explanation, and when she called me to explain why this situation occurred, the landlady was spraying and unpleasant, saying ""she doesn't care where I find the accommodation now, it's my problem, etc. "" From earlier telephone conversations, you could feel that they were not very friendly people. . . . . .I got the impression that they're really doing me a favor by giving me a night's sleep. A massacre, what an approach to a customer. Luckily, I managed to find a night's lodging for my vacation after a long search, because most of them already lack vacancies. I wish you a successful holiday, but not in ' Tatarzanka "" Greetings! !"

4555,"Comparing 3 * to those in PL is unfortunately not good. The old hotel but with a very good breakfast and nice service. Breakfast at first sight seems to be modest but the sausage is very good, marmalades from jars (they look like their own work) are delicious! Breakfast is sweet and salty as you like. Underground car park, elevator from the car park to the reception."
4556,"Spacious and quiet rooms, you can not hear the sounds of the street, (room on the side of the Golden Terraces and John Paul II Avenue), comfortable beds, well equipped room, is a lot of night lights, you can quietly work the evening in bed. Good breakfast. Good price/quality ratio. There is an underground parking under the hotel, but we pay dearly for it (80 PLN/day). For business stays very good location. I recommend it."
4557,"The hotel on the sidelines but I chose it because every Ibis Styles to this location was a charming hotel with an unprecedented arrangement, the tobacco however corresponds to the Ibis BUDGET class, and the lack of air conditioning in rooms in the 21st century totally disqualifies this hotel from the Accor network but . . . The lady at the reception desk, despite the English flag with the English name, had serious problems. It was also the first time I've encountered that when traveling in four people we only got 1 coupon for a welcome drink. Rooms and bathrooms OK . Honor saved me the day before at the Mercure Hotel in Mannheim dark leather MARC Z , who came to work in the evening also at this hotel , REVELATIVE man , I pretend to Marc for a bonus and promotion because it is worth to take care of such people and appreciate . Parking only on the hotel square for 7 euros."
4558,"According to Dr. Karney the doctors should be concerned about the information from the mother that the child behaves differently from previous infections. ""The child may be sleepy but also irritated, he may be hypersensitive to touch and doesn't want to be cuddled, sometimes the light interferes with him,"" explained the specialist. In the case of sepsis during the development of invasive meningococcal disease, the child has a petechial rash on the skin. Nowadays, the most important bacteria that cause sepsis can be protected against it by means of vaccinations. In the Polish calendar of obligatory vaccinations there are vaccinations against H . influenzae type B and pneumococcal infections . Vaccinations against meningococci are recommended in the calendar and parents must finance them themselves . In the case of the youngest children, the most important is vaccination against meningococcus type B, which is responsible for IChM in more than 80% of children under the first year of life . In the group of adolescents, vaccination against meningococcus type C is recommended. It is also possible to apply vaccination against four types of meningococci - C , A , Y and W 135 . ( PAP )"
4559,"We were with our wife and children in RizaVilla, we are delighted! The rooms are clean, very neat and tastefully furnished, all like a high-class hotel. . . . .only a much lower price! ! The owners and staff are very helpful and cordial, they invoice from yes. We will come back there because it is a proven place - REVELATION! ! ! ! !"
4560,"Clean and cosy room with a view of the mountain range. The hotel from outside attracts the eye with its appearance and location. The interior is interestingly designed. Tasty food, nice and friendly receptionists, professional waiters and always smiling, good service in the SPA. The biggest minus of this positive place turned out to be the fireplace room: cozy, comfortable with a terrace but with a big maras in the form of a bartender. Sitting at the bar we listened to what kind of drinks the bartender serves not to his liking. For example: spitting and adding water. . . . .however, the apogee of that evening turned out to be the fact of adding physiological needs even to his own boss. I wonder if it tasted good? ? ? Judging by the bartender's reaction and alcoholic intoxication, the drink was excellent : ) The stay can be considered successful after an unsavoury incident in the form of a bartender in the fireplace room."
4561,"Small but cosy rooms. New and nice furniture . Clean . No hair dryers. High stairs at the entrance, so you have to bring your luggage. There were 2 ladies at the reception. One nice and helpful. Then there was the other one, it's better not to interfere with work. . . There were many parking spaces in front of and behind the hotel. Comfortable access from the route. . ."
4564,"I don't recommend, or at least not for that price. And I was there in September 2013, but I couldn't mark that date anymore. ; / It seems 4 stars, and I would give m a maximum of 3. The hotel near the Russians, as well as the whole Kemer. The few advantages are: good location, food, daily cleaning of the rooms, wi - fi in the lobby, not too big a hotel, swimming pool sufficient for the size of the hotel. And at this end, unfortunately, the advantages. The staff do not speak English, they have a problem with even the easiest words - towel type. . Medium food, only there is quite a choice - which saves the grade itself. The beach doesn't convince me - not many sun loungers, poor quality, the beach itself also leaves a lot to be desired. The rooms also don't look particularly good in comparison to what was in the catalogue or on the website. In general, I think that for this price you can find something better. ; /"
4565,"The hotel is quite large. Good location . Underground parking too small, winding and access to the reception as in the Roman catacombs. Elevator from the car park to the reception, historic maybe the cabin itself but not the door from the Gierek era. The lady at the reception is very nice. Mini bar - on request? ? ? Curiosity. In this hotel class? I have Gold status in the AccorHotels program. In other hotels, in addition to the standard welcome drink in the room, there was a ticket and. . . . . . .a little surprise. In this hotel. . . . .zero. A few years ago, there was 'em and that's how they treated 'em too. I probably won't be staying in it for the third time unless the situation makes me do it.

4566,"Mice with sterile digestive tract were used for this purpose. They are rodents in which the bacterial microbiota of the intestines is not developed at all. Such sterile mice were grafted with intestinal bacteria from ""dream"" mice, kept for four weeks in cooler conditions. In comparison, other mice were grafted with bacteria from mice kept at normal temperatures that did not have to struggle with the cold. After transferring the intestinal microbiota to the recipients, all mice were on a high-fat diet - under normal conditions the animals fed in this way would quickly gain weight. It turned out that mice with a set of bacteria from frozen mates for a long time (tested for six weeks) remained lean, had better glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and lower percentage of fat in body weight. And yet, because of the diet, animals should not remain lean. At the same time, the control mice - with bacteria taken from mice reared in standard warm conditions - gained weight as expected."
4567,"It's been a long time since I could see a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist? How can such a doctor help me? I'm not mentally ill... It was only after the visit that she realized that this is not what we think. The doctor is a wonderful woman who devotes her time to her patients, trying to help them as well as possible. Thanks to her, she understood what my problem was and how to deal with it - which did not mean that I was ""abnormal"". She is a reliable doctor who puts good contact with the client above everything."
4568,"The hotel is well located at Potsdamer Platz, a 10 minute walk from Brandenburger Tor. Many pubs, cafes, shopping mall, entertainment center are nearby. Despite the central location, the rooms are very quiet. The bed is very comfortable. The advantage is the large size of the rooms. My apartment had 60 m2. In each apartment there is a small kitchen with coffee/tea service in the room price. Breakfast is varied and recommendable if you are ready to spend 28 Euros on it."
4570,"The price is very low compared to the standard that the hotel provides, clean bathrooms, fresh linen, and high level service that you want more? Location in the center of the hotel seems to be an ideal choice for couples but also for families."
4571,"I feel very sorry for your loss of the child. However, in your statement you do not present any problems, symptoms that would not give you peace of mind, and which you pointed out to the doctor during the visit. Certainly, if you had reported any problems, I am convinced that you would not have been without the doctor's answer. In fact, it can be concluded that the pregnancy at the time of the visit was not objectionable to the doctor. The doctor has written down your vitamins in accordance with the course of your pregnancy and ordered a list of tests that you should do immediately and report back to the doctor. You don't write anything, after what time the tests were done, if everything was okay and when you came back to the doctor. You can only draw the conclusion that you have not been to see the doctor for at least 3-5 weeks. It should be remembered that the most important thing in the first weeks of pregnancy is to observe the development of the fetus, whether the fetus is developing in accordance with the adopted stages, and you should know about it yourself. Being in the 8th week of pregnancy, i.e. really in the 6th week after fertilization, such an early age of pregnancy is not always advanced enough to capture the heart rate of the embryo. At a later date, the nucleus of the heartbeat should be visible and it is possible to capture the heart rate on an ultrasound. You do not write anything that the doctor said while doing the ultrasound, if he had any doubts about the examination and correct development of the embryo. All this indicates that in your case it was still too early to determine the heartbeat, and the allegations you made are a little out of place and a lot out of place before making a diagnosis from the histopathological examination. However, there is no doubt that it is sad and unfortunately more and more common that the embryo stops developing at some point for various reasons, it can be caused by e.g. genetic defect or no hormonal demands etc. In such a situation you should experience any ailments such as fever, bleeding, abdominal pain, which you also do not mention anything about. It is known that the body treats a dead fetus like a foreign body and at least you should have a fever. There is no doubt that you should be vigilant during the first trimester of pregnancy and pay special attention to any changes in your body. After all, the doctor will not call you every day and find out if you have done tests and how you feel, much more interest in pregnancy should be on your side. Once again, I am very sympathetic to you and wish you good luck, as well as read the reading and proper preparation for your next pregnancy."
4572,"Doctor good , she made an initial diagnosis , she recommended the examination although the time spent in line is a massacre , private visit and the time of delay of 1 , 5h about which no one informs earlier . You could use a phone call from the reception that there is a delay in the visit and it would be all right."

Organic milk and meat also have a higher percentage of certain minerals and antioxidants. Scientists note that the replacement of conventional milk and meat in the daily diet with organic products is to a certain extent associated with an increase in the intake of important health-related fatty acids. The study was published in the British Journal of Nutrition. The author of the study is Dr. Ing. Dominika Średnicka - Tober from the Faculty of Human Nutrition and Consumption Sciences, SGGW.

4574,"869 hotels with 145,303 rooms were under construction, advanced planning and planning in January, according to the Global Construction Pipeline Report prepared by STR. This is just a little more than the year before. In January 2012 the development chain included 866 hotels with 139,700 rooms. This year, therefore, 0.35% is being built. The number of hotels and 4 per cent more rooms than in the previous year is slightly higher. While in January 2012 the largest hotel construction site was London, which was preparing for the Summer Games, where the development chain included 4,638 rooms, in January this year the largest number of rooms - 4,228 - was created in Istanbul, Turkey. The second largest hotel construction site remains invariably Moscow, where 2,523 rooms are being built this year compared to 2,228 in January 2012.

4575,"Here you can write and write only superlatives. Dr. Dudarewicz is a specialist like no other. I went to him for a 3D ultrasound after another ""specialist"" found out that I have a high probability of having a child with a defect. Dr. Dudarewicz did the ultrasound very carefully, all the time telling me what and how. He treats the patient not as an object but as a normal person who does not necessarily have to know everything. After the visit I went out calmly and most importantly, all that he said worked out how my healthy, pretty son was born. The only problem is the deadlines - you really have to sign up earlier, because the doctor has a lot of patients not only from Łódź."
4576,She made an appointment for me because she wanted to change doctors and found me a doctor. Borawski good opinions . They turned out to be exaggerated. The doctor during the visit did not want to look at the results because he was tired. Everything she said to me was on NO. She came out of the office crying and didn't come back again.
4577,"I was surprised by the length of the visit. A very thorough analysis of the situation by a dietician . Exactly, but clearly explained to me what and how. I got my recommendations by email. The explanations were so accessible that after the first visit I composed my own menu. I only use the check-up visits that check that I am ""on the course"". I see a significant improvement in my mood - more energy (I drink much less coffee because I don't need it anymore), better performance, digestion, better memory, concentration, smaller belly, heart working like clockwork. Soon, I hope to ""dismiss"" from the work of a cardiologist and give up drugs as it goes on. There is great contact by email or phone with a nutritionist. And the dietitian herself is an accessible and relaxed woman."
4578,"A very kind and big-hearted doctor, but with insufficient knowledge of the treatment of infections in pregnant women. Lack of herbal treatment (e.g. Sinupret - available in every pharmacy, diluting nasal secretion, essential for treating infections in allergy sufferers). For this reason, the infection was prolonged for a period of 2 weeks and it was necessary to visit an ENT specialist, who immediately prescribed this medicine."

After two months of use with my Jack Russell, who is additionally fastened in his belts, the trimmings in which the metal wires are placed began to rip. My pet likes to lean to the side and watch the world go by behind the glass. The wires, bent up, started to come out vertically upwards and towards the seats with broken trimmings. All sewing in the style of a drunken master, plastic zippers of very poor quality. Padding material (fleece in the paws) likes to hold the hair which cannot be cleaned unless it devotes all day to plucking out every hair in turn. If the playpen had full stiff sides would be much better. Nowadays the playpen is one year old and it looks like it has 10 of them: / . Weakly. . ."

4581,"In the pictures everything is nice, but in fact dirt everywhere. Worst place ever seen m . Very unpleasant service that made me pay for a night in this shithole. It took to vomit as they showed us the room where we were supposed to spend the whole week off. People who miss this pence, don't let the proverbial buzz go. I can see that all the positive opuses are displayed by the owners' friends. This blonde (I think Kasia) is not very polite to the guests, she shouts constantly and argues with her guy in front of the guests. They paid us a down payment, so one night in this shithole spent, in the morning, we run away from this place as soon as possible."
4582,"The Lower Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases Medinet is a non-public clinic which has been running a scientific circle for ten years for medical students. This year's success is so spectacular that so far it has not happened that as many as four works from one centre have been included in the congress programme. ""Our students have written very original scientific materials, and the fact that their works have been noticed shows that they have a good chance to become good cardiac surgeons. In my generation we learned how to operate from photocopies of American textbooks, because we could not afford the original books. Nowadays, students have a much easier way to learn the secrets of cardiac surgery"" - emphasized Kołtowski."
4583,"Yesterday, not looking at the reviews on the internet bought 'em in a hypermarket, checked 'em to see if it works - ok . I brought 'em home and wanting to wash they took out the filter, I was intrigued by some rattle inside, wanting to take off the trumpet knife, unscrewed 'em two screws out of three of him fixing it and took 'em for a third one. Unfortunately, the third one couldn't unscrew it - probably a broken thread and maybe the crumbs were between the plastic housing and the strainer knife. He took 'em back to the store with the intention of replacing them with another one . Unfortunately, in the second and only copy also rattle took place . He gave 'em up and I'm going to look in another shop because this model seems to be the optimal one. How I buy I will describe ."
4584,"Mrs. Pecura mainly treats homeopathy. Despite the requests that we do not want homeopaths and so she wrote them down. The child had a mild cough and a week after the homeopathy ended up with an antibiotic. . . . Mrs. Pecura also has no approach to children. My 3-year-old boy from other doctors willingly undergo tests even with a smile on his face, but these doctors have an attitude towards children and do not force their spatula down his throat and Mrs. Wolska - Pecura always forcefully tests a crying child. . . . I hope that you will take your attention to the heart and change your approach to the patient, especially the smallest one."

Arrogantly arguing with hotel guests. . . strangers in the restaurant at breakfast stood up in their defence against the brazenly raising the voice of the lady from the back and reception. . . Another matter was the very low-level approach to the customer at the reception. . . . .chasing away where the better can park and where the worse can. . . . . and the worst part is that at breakfast was the old food from the party the previous night. . . . .not fresh!

4586,"I was on a visit to Mrs. Dr. Sobieszańska-Jablonska at the Enel - med clinic, privately, first and last time. The doctor made ""diagnosis"" in the fifth minute of the visit, when asked if any research would be useful to support her theory, she answered that she already know, based on the interview (she asked three questions, one answer she understood, as it later turned out, badly). She refused to refer her to the study because she couldn't only make referrals on one visit! \ (she hasn't written any yet, and the visit was private, I recall). She didn't examine her breasts and she didn't even ask if I wanted such an examination. She asked me for an ultrasound referral, she wrote it out with great grace. Actually, all she did was take a cytology - that's what I expect from a nurse and not from a doctor."
4587,"Hotel Ok for the price. The food is expensive but tasty and you can survive. The only downside is that you have to read the menu carefully because here they make a man in the bubbles they write that the portion is for two people after which it turns out that, however, is for one and you have to pay double. It is better to order a soup for 5 euros than a steak for 40 which turns out to be worth 80 euros."
4588,"I came to see your doctor for the first time with all my medical records - blood tests, etc. I called him earlier and he found out what the price is and whether he has an ultrasound, etc. The professor studied everything very carefully and explained what is going on. He ordered the tests (part of the paid part at the NFZ in the hospital) and with the results I have to go to him. I have been with Professor Warmus twice so far and so far I am satisfied."

The second time it did not start at all - you can only see the progress bar with the information that the configuration is in progress and you can not turn off for 24 hours anyway. My 3 year old son got it for his birthday and cried all day long that he can't play with it through this damn configuration. He thought I was gonna go crazy Besides: - The rubber is easily moving away from the case - weak sound ( When it starts, it makes a signal that creaks terribly ), others didn't hear 'em because unfortunately nothing works Tomorrow I'm going to return it and get my money back especially after reading all these opinions"
4591,"The hotel from the outside doesn't make a special impression, but the other elements definitely make up for it. The room may not have been big, but it was neatly decorated (except for one serious drawback - the distance from the wall to the bed is about 15 cm wide). with a large, modern and very clean bathroom. The view from the window may be uninteresting (courtyard) but we did not pay special attention to it. The biggest advantage (besides nice and helpful staff) is the breakfast, very varied, with a surprising element of pancakes with several types of filling. Certainly to live again."
4592,"She got to Dr. . with urinary tract inflammation and kidney inflammation. The doctor proved to be very sympathetic and kind. After one unsuccessful ultrasound examination (through an empty bladder), the second one was performed by Dr. Brown. It was not just a few minutes' visit, I was given medication, which quickly helped, she was given a mremic for painkillers (the doctor noticed that I have very strong pains in my kidneys) and she paid m 70 PLN for everything. I think it is not an exorbitant price."

(First of all in the description of the hotel there is available parking, only about 400 meters from the hotel! ! ! There is no place to stop in front of the hotel, even to unpack luggage! Hopeless information about the location of the rooms, not very clear instructions. No possibility to have dinner at the hotel if you are not an organized trip. The advantage is the breakfast, the big choice, it's just a shame that coffee with milk is. . . . .without coffee (probably a broken coffee machine?) . Unfortunately, the hotel staff forgot about the culture and good manners, on the corridors and stairs in the morning there are dirty bed linen, spread out vacuum cleaners, rags, it is difficult to pass through a narrow corridor. They have not heard of the word ""good morning"". . . Not very helpful and resourceful, there is even a problem with a small extension of the hotel day. A room with a strange smell, cooled (and summer is over), very ""coarse"", low standard. Generally I do not encourage or recommend it."
4594,"She was lying to me in August this year. . . .for the second time at your ward. First time in January 2012 . Necessary examinations were done, a diagnosis was made . The second time there was more fear by the irresponsible and incompetent Dr. who scared me at a private visit that I have an adrenal tumor. And for the second time, the tests were done, the diagnosis was made and the appropriate drugs were chosen. I did not go to see Dr. privately and the place was in the ward. She also did not go to Dr. Szymczak, who turned out to be a super expert in his field. For me, Dr Tuchendler is a 100% professional. I can't imagine being stroke on my head in the hospital. Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a doctor not a husband or a wife who will say a good word, hug and comfort you. You have to get used to the way you are, Dr . During the previous and current stay, Mrs. Dr. was available to me, she found time to talk in her office after the visit and during the visit she answered the question in concrete and factual terms. Is she arrogant? Brazen? Not available? Does she disrespect people and see them as a money machine on a private visit? That's what I can't say about you, Dr. . These are the opinions of people who are just healthy, who feel sorry for themselves, and who are blaming all the evil on you, Dr. Dr. If you have ever been treated for endo diseases, it is only with Dr. Tuchendler and her wonderful crew that she has in the internal medicine ward at the Military Hospital. Heartfelt greetings to Dr Dominika Tuchendler and Dr Szymczak, who infects the patients with his calm and composure. Kasia"

4597,"As emphasized by the participants of the jubilee celebration, over 70 years of the institution's existence a great deal of progress has been made in oncology - patients are treated much more effectively. ""When 32 years ago I decided to work at the institute, my colleagues knocked on my forehead and said that I couldn't stand it mentally, because it was too burdensome - there was no success, patients were dying. I already knew at that time that it wasn't true"", said Prof. Jozef Kowalski. Składowski . "" Definitely during those 50 years back there was a development. The dream of mankind is to avoid cancer, but this dream will probably never come true, because the nature of biology is such that cancer must take place, it is one of the processes of nature. Our goal is to detect this process so early that cancer can be destroyed at the earliest possible stage, including when the patient does not realise at all that he may be sick. I am optimistic - scientific discoveries will contribute to the fact that we will talk about long life and good quality of life,"" he added."

4599,"They reported to Mrs. Iwona when Emilka was having trouble turning her back on her stomach. During the visits Mrs. Iwona trained me with the exercises that she was supposed to do at home, so she could do them on her own and precisely on the child, which certainly shortened the rehabilitation time. It was very nice to talk to her, she always quoted some health curiosities and gave a lot of additional advice. She always answers text messages and phone calls, is very committed and selfless. I highly recommend it. Rehabilitation ended with 7 visits. Currently Emilka is 7 months old and is already crawling and trying to get up. She used to be with motor development behind her peers, and now she is much ahead of them. Thank you Mrs. Iwono : )"
4600,"The service at the reception desk is very slow and extremely unpleasant. Level of personal culture and willingness to help zero . Squalid, stinking room, decor not changed for 15 years including TV. She wanted to have a nice time and feel luxurious, unfortunately, the only price was this. . . Next door is the hostel where she spent 1 night - a room better than the Novotel, the staff was nice and helpful and the price was 3x lower. After a night spent in this hotel I can only say one thing - I am sorry"
4601,"The ladies at the reception desk were nice and smiling, although at the beginning there was a clash because she forgot to give us the key ( such a detail ) ) The rooms are clean and cozy, but only in the evening and actually at night it turned out that there are thin walls between the rooms, we had to listen to German TV almost till the morning: ""So the night rest after the trip was terrible, and the room was very stuffy with broken air conditioning so we had to ventilate the room all day long and still at night we opened windows and the hotel is on a busy road. . Bathrooms with glass doors, a great and modern shower, but a small bathroom, a small cardio zone, a rather tasty kitchen in the restaurant, huge portions; although we were given a sour soup that was not suitable for eating, a breakfast buffet not as extensive as in other hotels * * * . . while the restaurant staff clumsily served guests, the lady in the bar kindly but we had the impression that as a punishment she had to spend Christmas at work, fortunately an hour by car and there is Hel! ! : ) )"

I often went to him for checks, for Ex-Political Prisoners because she had very painful months, and he reassured me that everything is okay and prescribed me strong pain medication. He didn't do me an ultrasound once, he did it to me only after he had examined with his finger a huge muscle! Now I'm after the Caesarean section, she prayed that the operation would be successful because I don't have children yet. I think that Dr. Dr. is not making any ultrasounds and the cytolgia alone is not enough."

Many opportunities to relax (amphitheater, shisha-bar, coves, park, swimming pools, bars, around the corner of the town). You will not feel the drop because of the pleasant sea breeze. Service OK, nice and pleasant. Food is varied, everyone will find something for themselves.

Everyone was bragging about Tacikowska, that's why she was walking with a feeling that my half year of anguish would end in revenge. Dr . She was very nice and friendly, but she felt as if she did not listen to me carefully. She did not announce anything to me. She diagnosed me with some pebbles and gave me a referral for blood, but she didn't prescribe anything or come home to me according to nothing and I have problems like this."

When they bought 'em a reviewed product, my woman said I couldn't cuddle up to her in the evening ( shaving always before bedtime ) because I'd smell like an old guy as she called it. But I decided to use the product and I think it's very good. First of all, it's efficient. Second, it's good to spread out. And third and most importantly, it softens the beard ( I have a hard one ) . The razor blade glides easily over the face ( good glide ) . And I'll admit honestly that I like this, quite specific WARS cream smell, very much. And I don't feel like an old guy at all, although years fly by."
4606,"Very kind doctor, with a lot of patience for small patients. She devotes a lot of time, listens patiently and answers all questions. There is not much I can say about the accuracy of the diagnosis and effectiveness of the treatment so far (I am after the second visit with my child to the doctor)."
4607,"As a patient, I'm not complaining, but give me the glory. The doctor was my pregnancy. I've been going to her for 7 years. The office that she has in beech at 700 years old is very cozy and stylish. The fact that there was no ultrasound and I don't know if it is now, I didn't mind going to the hospital."
4608,"I don't recommend it. It is not only about the queues mentioned by others in front of the office door, but above all about the diagnosis: the doctor, after excluding coeliac disease, completely underestimated my ailments (probably no idea for a proper diagnosis) as well as did not take into account the results of the gastroscopy commissioned by him (bacterial infection and suspicion of mycosis) - only another doctor prescribed me the appropriate drugs, being surprised that it was underestimated. Not to mention the fact that when the doctor got sick and canceled the appointment while promising to make contact for another appointment, there was no such contact (maybe she wasn't a serious enough case for the doctor: ("

The method of isolating stem cells from fetal tissue is known worldwide, safe and scientifically described, but in some environments it raises ethical questions.

Stained carpet on the floor, no water to drink in the room / at the reception 200 ml for 6 zł. ! ! ! /, Not working shower, wet floor in the bathroom / toilet bowl leakage / tragic furniture, disgusting lamps on the bed.

If not extreme hunger, then at least food shortages"" - says PAP neurobiologist Dr Marek Kaczmarzyk from the University of Silesia. As a result, a reward system was developed, i.e. a mechanism built into the brain to reward for what is adaptable, i.e. providing food, especially high calorie food.

We also had a problem with the angle of inclination of the seat - I finally cut out the foam in the car; - ) ( I bought an extra seat ) . It's all about the car. I'm just too small. The seat is quite high. I advise against buying in the dark - you have to try it on. The car seat is very good in quality. Forward-facing adjustment - great thing - the child has grown up and just turned the car seat. It is quite narrow - it holds the child well, but if it is bigger, in winter it is a problem. This is rather up to 15 kg less. The tilt adjustment is small. We had problems with our head falling down when sleeping for the front position."
4613,"Hello, I am writing this opinion after 2 years of use. I was looking for em something for the sport and it seemed small and the usb entrance considered em as an asset because I made up my tooth I will also use it as a pen driva. For the whole six months I used it only once as a pendriva . At the start, he changed em to sports headphones. He used 'em 1 - 2 hours a day while practicing or cycling. The battery noticeably weakened during this time and was getting less and less time, for the last 3 months I had to recharge every day and for 2 days it has not charged at all. Suddenly it stopped charging, it only works as a pedrive - it's only safe when plugged into the combo. I don't know if I have fallen prey to aging equipment or not, but I will never again buy this pen because of the inefficient battery. During the novelty was enough for 4h listening to the radio and on the new headphones for 2h . I personally advise you to buy something without a display with a solid battery and not this crap."

There was a lack of contact with the doctor, he answered the questions yes, but he himself was frugal in his words. He did not propose to give birth on Szparagowa Street, so I was left alone. But I have a lesson for the future, to choose such a doctor who will lead to the end."
4615,"It was a hotel where we slept 1 night as a stopover on our journey, so the location was not necessarily important. The price is great (80 euro for an apartment with an extra bedroom), but parking is very expensive - 24 euro. The room is clean, pleasant, friendly staff, the restaurant is staffed by Poles: ) Tasty breakfast, generally I have no reservations."
4616,"I'm sorry about the money we spent. They bought us a base for the seat so that my wife could fasten the seat quickly and easily. The thing is that the mechanism jams and sometimes it takes me a few minutes to unlock it. The base with the seat can and does collect decent points in crash tests, but it looks like it's only been done under crash tests. handling and using this trash is a nightmare. The seat is also very heavy. With the child on board, the woman is not able to move it from apartment to car. I sincerely advise against it."

I had concerns while reading this forum if I did not resign from the visit already arranged with Dr. Oplawski.

She had to deal with several gynaecologists from Cracow with excellent opinions and many years of experience, I must say with dr . Opławski is not missing anything to them. Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, while reading opinions about many people from this branch, I came to the conclusion that some gynaecologists are great obstetricians and other surgeons and let's stick to that, you can't be the best in all areas, it's just not real.

My niece was probably with 4 different doctors with the same problem and nobody recognized the real problem / cause of her illness. It is not enough to mention that the doctors came to the conclusion that the child is artificially causing symptoms and a visit to a psychologist is necessary! ! Luckily, we found Dr. Wieczorek, who ordered the proper examinations and quickly identified a very specific disease. The treatment is quickly effective. Thank you very much, Doctor, also for saving the child from unnecessary visits to other doctors, including the suggested psychologist. . : ) ) By the way, I can only add that the Doctor is a warm and empathetic person."
4630,"The doctor tries to dominate the patient all the time, showing his superiority and treating him from above, very rude. He is not interested in the patient's medical records. In his private Procto - Med office in Sosnowiec there is no possibility to make a video recording of the examination such as rectoscopy, which in other even cheaper offices is already a standard. The result / description of the performed rectoscopy is handwritten by the doctor on the prescription - nowadays a legible printout of the description / result of the examination from the computer is a standard. For my own health I strongly advise against visiting this man."
4631,"In practice, it could be that a facility that is not categorized according to current (very formal) regulations would have five Hotelstars at the same time. On the other hand, if they were to receive another five stars according to Hotelstars Union rules, they could present a total of ... ten stars on their fronts. IGHP wants to HOTREC and HOTREC wants Hotelstars. However, we would like to stress that for the time being it is only about ""some of the hoteliers"", because although IGHP itself is the largest organization of this type in Poland, it currently has less than 5%. The hotels operating on our market."
4632,"The hotel is very nicely located in a quiet area. In winter there is a small ski lift next door. The rooms on the lower floors are better, those in the attic have slants that can be a problem for taller people. In the latter, the TV set is located in such a place that watching the programs is bordering on ecuvilibrium, additionally, there is a nuisance of smell from the toilet. In the apartment there was no hot water in the friends. The walls were poorly muffled, you can hear the neighbour snoring. Very modest pillows. Besides, generally ok . The staff at the reception desk and the waiters are as good as possible."

4634,"Conference participants also spoke about the fact that there are more and more products and dietary supplements on the market and there is a lack of knowledge and awareness about them. Dr hab . Jadwiga Hamułka, President of the Polish Society of Food Sciences at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW), pointed out that the common advertising of dietary supplements makes consumers make decisions under the influence of the moment. She also said that many people still confuse supplements with drugs. She also pointed out that the group that takes many supplements - even several at the same time - are pregnant women, which can be dangerous because it can lead to interactions with food, drugs, overdoses. She reminded that supplements do not and cannot replace an adequate, varied diet. She pointed out that they can be used periodically when the disease has resulted in the loss of some ingredients and they need to be supplemented quickly. ""And then it's completely different,"" added Hamulka."
4635,"The second group of drugs entering myeloma treatment are so-called HDAC inhibitors (histone deacetylase). One of these, discussed in detail at the congress, is panobinostat. ""These drugs are not a breakthrough for the time being, but they improve treatment results,"" said the head of the Department of Haematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine of the Medical University of Warsaw, prof. Wiesław Jędrzejczak . As he added, the next drug to enter myeloma therapy more and more widely is the so-called third generation immunomodulating drug called tomatoomide. It works in some patients resistant to lenalidomide (second generation immunomodulating drug). Both of these preparations have the same active molecule and cause fewer side effects than thalidomide ( first generation immunomodulating drug ) ."
4636,"I'm very pleased with Dr. . Kuchevich. As soon as she found out to me that my pregnancy had died she got a big support from this doctor. He immediately made a fugitive in the Bielany hospital and took care of me all the time. Besides, I have been visiting him for some time now and he cured my erosion and took care of my mood in the hospital. Besides, he checked whether the pregnancy lives twice at my request without any problem. A great positive thing for me."
4637,"The hotel has no air conditioning in the rooms. Tearaz, when outside is 12 degrees in the day, there is no heating in the rooms. Upon request for intent in this matter the reception desk answers that there are no radiators and that the heating season will only start soon. The management of the facility at my request answered in writing that I could look for another hotel as my stay here does not suit me. The spa area is a neglected place, dark, the fear of staying there, there is no staff there, there is little light, no towels, clothes lockers are blown up. . . At night there are loud noises from other rooms."
4638,"The agreement was signed on Friday by the rector of the UO, prof . Stanisław S . Nicieja, Marshal of Opole Province Andrzej Bula and Deputy Marshal Roman Kolek, who is responsible for health care issues in the local government of Opole Province. The document includes, among others, the . The document states, among other things, that the local government of the Opolskie Voivodeship expresses its willingness to make seven hospitals under its jurisdiction available to the university"" to carry out teaching tasks on uniform master's degree courses in medicine in the form of practical education"" . These include the Provincial Hospital in Opole, the Provincial Medical Centre in Opole, as well as the Centre for Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Neonatology in Opole, the Provincial Specialist Neuropsychiatric Team in Opole, the Opole Oncology Centre in Opole, the Opole Rehabilitation Centre in Korfantow and the Stobrawa Medical Centre in Kup ."
4639,"It was my first time at your doctor's house ( check-up visit ) . The examination took place on time and was conducted in a pleasant atmosphere. The doctor did all the research with comments (what is what, how everything looks like, where to look, what to observe) and recommendations for future follow-up visits, what to pay attention to. I am satisfied with the course of the visit, all examinations according to the reservation made by me (ultrasound, cytology, gynecological examination) were performed on it."
4640,"For all those who are looking for a private visit to Dr. Gavrísia. There is NO private medical practice in Wroclaw. The only place where Dr. Gavrísia takes a private visit is Pieszyce. There, at the clinic twice a month, you can sign up for a private visit. Enter the password Grzegorz Gawrys Pieszyce into your google and you will find the phone number to register: ) Hopefully, I helped."
4641,"Dr. Łabiak had an ultrasound confirming the pregnancy in the 7th week. There is no doubt that at this stage the doctor does not have much to say to the patient, however, Dr. Łabiak seemed to be not very communicative, he answered questions halfway. He did not give me any information on how I should proceed and this is my first pregnancy. I have no objections to the competence of the doctor."
4642,"I'm very nervous after seeing this doctor! ! ! His behaviour towards his parent is outrageous and I intend to make a complaint . Rude, very offensive to people, completely unnecessary and unpleasant words in relation to another person who comes for advice. Not only did he not help my child, but she also listened to me so much about herself. . . . . .and I don't know why he insulted me so much. She had tears in her eyes when she came out. I personally advise against it, because apart from inappropriate behaviour, it did not help at all to solve my son's illness. And his recommendations were completely misguided. I'm just wondering what kind of a person you have to be to like the doctor (that's what someone wrote earlier: ""The doctor has little contact with people who don't like him."") ? . She was nice, smiling, I'm always good with people, so I can't understand why it happened to me? I still remember that visit. I've never seen a doctor like that before. I advise against it, because even the doctor's knowledge left a lot to be desired."
4643,"The hotel on the Internet advertising itself as 4 * and presented in beautiful pictures looks like from a movie nightmare! ! ! Dark, devastated, fungal, dirty and stinky. Rooms unsuitable for the apartment, broken windows, dripping ceilings, cobwebs, dirty carpets, torn handles, lack of light bulbs and wall lamps, torn floor on terraces and at rest. Pool and playroom not suitable for use . There are no cards for rooms, some of them have been renovated despite the fact that guests have reported there. The owner of the hotel is hiding from people and does not want to return the money for the unrealized offer. Fraud and not Easter holidays! ! !"
4644,"I definitely do not recommend! ! This gorgeous doctor found me a pcos. I'm only 21 years old, so the vision of fertility has broken me. I went to 3 other gynaecologists and what turned out to be I AM HEALTH! The other doctors confirmed it. But what I've been through and crying is mine: / I paid 120 bad money and in return only nerves and stress. . and it's completely unfounded! It was a waste of time and money."
4645,"My son had his first visit with Dr. Tatiana Janiszewska at the Neurology Outpatient Clinic. After entering the office Mrs. Janiszewska did not allow to close the front door for this reason the whole conversation was heard by patients in the corridor. The doctor violated the right of my child and parents to protect privacy and confidentiality of my son's treatment. My wife and I came to see him. Mrs. Janiszewska told me to leave my office during the visit and only my wife remained. He refused to tell me that as a father I have the right to be present at my son's medical visit together with my wife. MRS. JANISZEWSKA WAS VERY UNPLEASANT. When asked about the purpose of the visit - weak contact of the child with the environment, Mrs. Janiszewska arrogantly tried to question that she did not understand such a purpose of our child's visit. For us parents such a reason is sufficient to consult a doctor, especially since we were referred by a paediatrician. Wife while undressing her son for examination saw that the baby's diaper was dirty and quickly changed it to clean. Mrs. Janiszewska said that the child should leave the office and this activity should be done in another room, about which unfortunately we did not know. This activity took only a minute for the wife. Mrs. Janiszewska's indignation from this event was great and we felt unpleasant. During the examination of our son, which lasted for a minute, we felt unpleasant. ! ! We heard a DIAGNOSIS that shocked us. Mrs. Janiszewska said that my son has a QUESTION - THE MOTOR MOVEMENTAL IMMOVABILITY and the most appropriate PSYCHORE, caused by the inability of the brain to be pregnant or in the time of birth. We were surprised because all the development to date did not show this and all the research since the birth did not show this. I am not a doctor, but I thought until now that this type of diagnosis should be preceded by more detailed examinations? ? ? Unfortunately, Mrs. Janiszewska has not found time for any more information. She wrote down a referral for rehabilitation and information for the family doctor. She advised the rehabilitation clinic in Gajowa Street, but said, and I quote - THERE IS THE FARM TIME OF VISIT AND YOU AND THERE IS A Few MONTHS DELAY! ! ! - we didn't understand it. After leaving the office, we were quite by chance directed to the hospital registration and what was our surprise when we found out that rehabilitation is possible in the same hospital on the next day, that Mrs. Janiszewska did not show us if supposedly there were some time limits left somewhere else and we were already late - a scandal! ! ! ! It was the first time in the history of medical visits with our children that we encountered such vile and disgraceful behaviour of a doctor. Supposedly, the hospital has a title - Friendly Child? ?"
4647,"I'm having trouble getting pregnant. She treated me for infertility only 1 year. Thanks to the doctor, I had it the second time, quite unfortunate because I was ordered to have an ectopic pregnancy. She got a referral for removal. After the next insemination, she succeeded again. I'm now the mother of the 10-month-old Zosia. My daughter is healthy. - and thanks to Mr. Bakalczuk, I'm a happy Mom. I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE"
4648,"I was referred to Dr. Magdalena by order of a dentist, the treatment was to last 2 - 2. 5 years . It lasted 3 or 5 years without good results (Dr Magdalena's proposal was to remove the braces, correct the occlusion with 2 new braces and further treatment for 3 years). After this proposal she resigned from further treatment with Dr. Magdalena and the dentist. Justification for my assessment: long and ineffective treatment, delays of up to 1 hour, in my case the change of the lock in the device never took place, too brief explanations about the treatment and too short check-up visits due to delays (no time for the patient, who finally spends the money). After a year of searching, she found me a specific orthodontist who treats my occlusion, there are no delays in admitting patients or 5 minutes. I advise you to check the opinion of doctors and look for and not take the first better one and trust such a person (where honesty and medical ethics in some?)."
4649,"Dyrda Agnieszka, M.Sc. Physics H 2 laboratory [ / b ] Super Woman, sign up for her, straightforward pages, no surprises, not always gives up the cause, easy to start with her, just do and understand what you hang out, relax at meetings, you can joke, you just feel at ease, does not hold students longer than necessary, you end up early, you leave early simply. everyone is complaining with her. : )"
4650,"The police, and certainly the prosecutor's office, would dispel these hopes: the digital recording of the camera image is not enough evidence for the court due to the ease of manipulation. The employees who were in contact with the fraudsters would not be able to testify unequivocally after a few weeks that the photo presented to them shows the fraudster. When asked: ""Was it that person you handled or a similar person? ""the answer in most cases would be : ""I'm not sure if this one, but a similar one for sure."" And after the case . The hotel would still be the sponsor of the weekend for a pair of fraudsters. Now let's imagine that when registering, the receptionist asked the guest to write their name, surname, town and sign the registration card by hand. And in case of guests arriving by car, the receptionist asked the guest to enter also the vehicle registration number, even if the car is parked on the street."
4651,"Hello, I would like to share my opinion about Dr. Kłoszewski, we go to see Mr. Doctor from 2 visits immediately after the birth of the child, the first visit to a completely different doctor. (where he found out that I'm a judgmental mother and neglected a 6-week-old child) Then we went to Dr. Kłoszewski and REVELATION . If it hadn't been for him, I would have had my child in a divider, a ferret pillow or something similar according to the first doctor's recommendations. And Dr. Kłoszewski explained everything, said and gave recommendations, a visit to a neurologist, rehabilitation and exercises in the house + orthopedic shoes. The reason for this lazy car is that we can't keep up with it. We go to the control systematically and there is an improvement. And the approach to the diet is also ok . I RECOMMEND"
4652,"Worst holiday ever! ! ! A week's stay for 7 adults and 4 toddlers cost 13,000! ! ! The cost of the week was 13,000 ! This is the first 4 * hotel in which none of us had the courage to walk barefoot on the carpet in the rooms. The bathroom was was washed by myself because my hair in the shower, dirty toilet and stained floor did not inspire confidence. Room service is limited to replacing garbage bags and bedding. The quilts that the hotel has at its disposal are classic 200cm long but bed linen is already 160cm! ? Pillows end in 3 / 4 lengths of the duvets - a very peculiar coating as for 4 * ! Corridors, staircases, elevators - it's better not to touch anything : ( Service - it's a pity to write here about sour faces and many times directed requests to take dirty dishes from the table that nobody has heard. It is only worth mentioning the waitress who collects plates from tables with a two-year-old on her hands in the restaurant (and probably not the first time, because the toddler helped Mom very much and he himself carried smaller plates, circulating between tables). Did we meet here something nice? Yeah, a massage in the SPA, but it's not enough to blur this FATAL TRAIN that this hotel does. Surprisedly, I read positive opinions, but I think they are written by the guests who are not very demanding because they praise the hotel 4 *! ! ! for the proximity of the ski slopes, fast wifi and the hotel lift? Hmmm ... not serious. Finally, one more thing - please don't believe in the assurances of the General Manager that all the faults will be removed immediately - unfortunately this is not true, you still have to push your head between the pillow and the lamp that touches our forehead : ("
4653,"Unfortunately, a big delay, over 20 minutes, and thus seems to me quite a big rush and little time for the patient. The price of the visit is above the average high, 150 PLN for 10 - 15 minutes is a lot, however. The Doctor's knowledge and hope for health after the application of her treatment attracts. I still lack precise guidelines on diet, maybe she will organize a course, workshops or a lecture on e.g. how to nourish children healthily - this is just a suggestion."
4654,"After arriving at the address given, it turns out that there is no room for us at this address as there was some problem with the system and our room has already been given away. The professional staff but looks completely lost and overworked. We have been informed that we will be moved to a private apartment at 17b Foksal Street on Nowy Swiat in the centre of Warsaw. Reluctantly, but due to lack of options, we agreed. The lady at the reception desk described this place in superlatives. We were given the address, the keys and so on - no form of transport or willingness to help with the costs associated with transport. They were shocked. Fortunately, our friend had a car and knew the area so there were no major problems with getting to the place. On the spot it turns out that the apartment is an ordinary room with a kitchen together so big that after putting the suitcases in there is not much room left. Bathroom separated by a sliding door which does not give any privacy. The cleanliness also leaves a lot to be desired. Under the furniture, tons of dust . The shower in the bathroom was leaking, the TV was receiving only a few channels - the rest was losing signal because a few minutes of watching. What was the worst thing is that this place is located in a very busy part of the city - especially at night. In front of our windows and front door there were 3 pubs and a restaurant open until very late at night. The noise from these places was huge. The first night we didn't sleep until 3 am. A nightmare. During the whole - 3 day stay no one called to check how to stay or ask about cleaning. . . ! ! On the last day, they called 'em to tell them about the faults etc . The lady who talked to me (eastern accent) was polite but made it clear that nothing could be done. I understand that this is only a hostel, but the standard of service and quality to price calls for vengeance to heaven. She suggests to the owner to get more interested because it may turn out that one day the customers will just run out. I advise against this place and do not recommend it to friends."
4655,"She wanted me to recommend Lady Elizabeth to all those who are afraid that in their case, nothing can be done anymore. She is a nice, competent person who can motivate everyone. Her knowledge helped me to lose weight, despite problems with hormones and forty pounds on my neck! I sincerely recommend!"
4656,"the hotel offer does not correspond to the reality (other rooms in the offer vs. what she received); unpleasant staff at the reception desk (one day they promise to change the room, the other day they say that there is no such option, that you should have checked earlier; she mentioned that I am not the first time - she heard that I have not been there for a long time). The sewage system is not working. . . However, the service of the spa and restaurant part of the good."
4657,"I was sent to the clinic where professor zw. dr hab works. Wojciech Sobaniec , I was in a lying state my condition was described as medium - acute . He put me on my feet in 4 days with several levels of discopathy. He focuses on the patient but does not talk to him only with the doctors. Greetings : )"
4658,The psychologist showed a lack of professionalism in my opinion because she had the impression that my system of values is being evaluated. It seemed to me that this is not what a visit to a psychotherapist is about. At one point she started to wonder whether our meeting was a conversation about the difference of our world views or rather an attempt to solve my problems. I do not recommend it to people with traditional values.
4660,"Last time I stayed at this Novotel was about 3 years ago, the reception desk looks better and there was a small change in the restaurant. Unfortunately, the rest probably remained so in the late 90s. I stayed overnight in the executive room, day to 4 pm plus, 3 free drinks, Nespresso, high-speed Internet and the location of the hotel are cool things. The service and breakfast are usually completely inexpressive. . . Downstairs at the entrance, there is a casino and a game room, which makes the hotel a little bit of a strange ""type"". I've always had a weakness for this hotel, but it's probably just over. Next time I'll probably find some other hotel in Poznan."
4661,"I've been going to your doctor's for two years and I'm very pleased. She's a professional in every way, and she's relaxed, which helps a lot. She can discharge the tension of the examination, and you can talk to her calmly: ) she treats the patient very seriously, she does not underestimate any possible doubts, she explains and explains everything patiently: ) So far, I'm not going to turn her into anybody else! ! !"
4662,"Manor house located in the heart of the Barycz Valley and Milicz Ponds. Surrounded by beautifully maintained green area with a magnificent forest stand, ponds. The manor house is surrounded by a beautifully well maintained green area with a magnificent tree stand, ponds . The building is maintained in the climate of the historic manor house from 1830. Natural bicycle and walking paths attract many tourists and make the herd relaxed and rested. Tasty and healthy cuisine, friendly and professional service, beautifully maintained facility, bicycle rental will make you want to come back here and every stay will be memorable. Thank you for your guest and we wish you all the best to those who took care of our good rest in the ""HERB BY TWO""."
4663,"Hello. A hotel on the sidelines, but that's what gives us the peace and quiet. From outside and inside it looks good. Clean and reasonably modern. The rooms are furnished very pleasantly and comfortably. Breakfast is tasty and there is something to choose from. But I also have to write about this slightly worse side of the hotel. After checking in it turned out that as a group we got double rooms and everything would be ok if there were no joined beds in the rooms and only one bedding (after the intervention at the reception we managed to fix it / explain). And the other not cool thing is a blocked electronic thermostat of heaters (the rooms were very hot and could not be changed) . However, for the whole thing, I must admit that the hotel is pleasant."
4664,"I came to Wieliczka with my mother, who felt weak on a cold Sunday day, so we went to the Galicia Hotel to call a taxi to Krakow. After the call we were supposed to wait until ten minutes for the taxi to arrive. I asked my 81-year-old mother to sit it there and wait. In response, I heard a ""NO"". ""The ladies aren't our hotel guests and they can go to the cafeteria or go out waiting outside"". I have explained again that my mother has a heart problem and if she could sit down and wait those few minutes. The answer was also negative. When, after a few days, I called to explain the situation, it was even more embarrassing to talk to Mrs. Clock / the person from the front staff / who knew she was there and the staff were treated as if she was. She also added: ""What would you like us to give you a bed and food""! ! ! WITHOUT COMMENTARY."
4665,"WARNING ! ! She organized a birthday party for 40 people in the hotel. Because the party was thematic, in the same climate, she wanted me to lead it. The DJ who was provided by the organizer had no idea what kind of party he was going to lead, was completely unprepared, three times he confused the name of the jeweler, and all previous arrangements and assurances of the manager turned out to be empty words. Only after 3 hours of ""fun"" she heard that we will not get cold drinks because they are already over, although the contract contained information that we have them without a limit. When the next day she tried to explain the whole situation and above all to inform the manager received information that it is not true what I say, the drinks were not promised and to add the matter claw heard me that one of my guests did not pay for his room. When she informed him that this guest has paid the bill and I have proof of that the contact was broken. The championship of everything and the summary of the whole thing was the fact that after the event she asked the staff to pack the rest of the food she heard m "" has just been thrown out "" Mockery and shame."
4666,"For 30 years, wandering around the various dermatologists (a severe form of acne that has been digesting me since grade 8 of primary school) is the first doctor who has helped me 100%. The doctor who knows what to do with the disease to help, cure it! Interestingly, my teenage daughter has also been cured of terrible acne (the genes are known not to be fooled). Thank you doctor, may every dermatologist be as professional as you! It's a pity that most dermatologists pretend to help by prescribing a lot of antibiotics and expensive slurries that only drown out the problem In fact, it's the only effective cure and thanks to you we are cured! I recommend to every such a wonderful person and doctor Thank you Agnieszka"
4667,"I am after my first visit to Mrs. Marzena, a very nice and smiling person, she advised how to speak not to reproduce bad eating habits, what will be the effects of the diet I do not know yet, I am waiting for the menu, I hope to succeed this time and I have a lot of extra kg. Greetings! !"
4669,"She chose this place for the fall weekend. The hotel is very nice and well maintained. The hotel staff is very nice, competent and friendly to guests. They got us here thanks to other opinions and did not disappoint us. Nice swimming pool, towels in the room both to us and swimming pool (I do not agree with the opinion that they are missing). The food is very good, the breakfast is varied and the dinner is fresh and nicely served. The surroundings of the hotel is a park with benches (we did not manage to pass it because of other attractions that we had planned). The spa is not ""grazed"" in terms of room climate and decor, but those who carry out treatments know their stuff. After the massage you can really relax. I was this hotel with two small children and the facilities in this regard is very good (we got a tourist cot, a heater). For this, the children are flashing to use the playroom (my boys usually played in it themselves so you can say that it was very intimate: ) ) . She'd like me to go there again: )"
4670,"Unfortunately, the hotel's tarena was undergoing loud renovation works about which the hotel does not inform its guests. Repair works lasted the whole stay from Monday to Friday from the morning hours to the hour. 16 . 00 Despite the promises of the hotel, the works were not finished and the renovation ended the peace of mind of the guests!"
4671,"In response to ""Hello. Maybe someone will write where this doctor is taking him and how much it costs to visit him. They say he's good. ""He certainly receives in Braniewo on Tuesdays after 6:00 p.m. and Thursdays after 2:00 p.m. in the battalion (clinic)."
4672,"We spent the night in the older part of the hotel - large, clean rooms. Towels changed daily. In the room dryer, safe, TV, small fridge. Food (HB option) varied, fresh food. Drinks for dinner are additionally paid (2, 70 euros for 0. 5 water, 4 euros for a small wine 187 ml etc). Large selection of fresh fruits . Helpful service . Very small lifts . Market at a distance of 50 m ) Carrefour ok. 150 m . Car rental and local travel agency at the hotel itself . Beach approx. 100 meters from the hotel (small, pebble and sandy) . We traveled with a 5-month-old child and we have no reservations."
4673,"I don't recommend I have to give a negative opinion on this doctor. I had a private visit with her today. 100 zloty lost . You have a very insensitive attitude during the examination. . . She doesn't listen to the course of the disease only halfway through the sentence. . . Coming to her after a few days of acute pharyngitis and sinusitis, she said that there is nothing wrong with me and that the ""slightly pink"" throat is taken ""septolete"". She felt I was powerless, unheard of, misunderstood and treated like a person who pretended to be sick. I don't recommend it."
4674,"And I have other things to do, doctor. My request for a referral for mammography, she disposed of the refusal because she refused to give me diagnostic tests, which were to take place in the hospital (3 days). Do the ultrasounds and markers, which among other things are included in these diagonal tests cannot be done outpatiently but you have to put the patient in the ward for 3 days because economic considerations prevail. Not long ago on TV there was a program, about oncological patients who instead of staying after radiotherapy in the hospital, the hospital rented them a room in the hotel, because both economically and psychically the patient functions better. But not at the Oncology Clinic on Weigla they go against the current."
4675,"We only spent four days in the hotel, but we had a lot of fun. The hotel offers so many attractions that there is no way to get bored. There is something for a 2-year-old child, and for a 10 year old. The staff deserves praise, they were able to solve unusual requests. The food, cleanliness without any problems. I highly recommend this hotel, I will certainly return to it with my family."
4676,"The lectures are pretty cool, conducted quite clearly and clearly. I don't know if there is anything to learn from them, not having any previous contact with the communist party, but I have some things in my head that have become clearer.) Just this wrap-up. . . : ? The pass is a selection test a, b, c, d . For good answer 1 point, for bad answer -1 / 2 and for none 0 . This year he even lowered the pass marker threshold from 12 to 10 points: shock: Generally, it is not bad, apart from AiR there is no other choice ; )"
4677,"That's how I got used to a certain level of this network. And at the entrance, a kind lady at the reception desk greeted me and assigned a room. The room was strangely large, but as it turned out it was for the disabled. Do I look like one? ? ? While the bedroom itself was a pleasant surprise, the bathroom adapted for the disabled surprised me. If you don't have anything to like. The evening service in the restaurant, moderately courteous, maybe it's a late hour effect, but should it absorb me? Inedible Tatar ! ! . Breakfast, a very large choice, I couldn't understand the dimmed lighting, I had to work hard to be sure what I was putting on the plate. However, just looking for a table took me a good few minutes and not because the restaurant was full, but everywhere the tables were full of dirty dishes from guests. And the service was zero. During 20 minutes of my breakfast no one appeared in the room and the lady at the restaurant reception, pretending that it does not concern her, effectively bypassed the areas with dirty plates, but she seemed extremely busy staring at the list of guests (there were only 4 people in the room). It wasn't a pleasant experience to have a meal among these dirty plates. In my opinion, there is something wrong with the staff which translates and hits one of my favourite hotel brands."
4678,"The doctor is nice and friendly, tries to help students, has a lot of knowledge and is willing to share it. For labs only to her: mrgreen : [ / b ]"
4679,"Close to a busy road, at 6 o'clock the cars were already driving. The layout of the room was strange. The door was opening to the wardrobe and it was difficult to enter with suitcases. The floor was terrible black and mouldy. Bathroom was tiny. Shower not domty . The lights half a meter above the head, some do not work. The chair dirty that until the fear to sit down. The comfort of beds average, but there is nothing to complain about, could be worse. A small number of sockets in the room. The rooms themselves are small, and in my case room 4 - wasps got a room the same size as 2 - wasps just collapsed with bunk beds. As far as bunk beds are concerned, they are poorly secured, on the side and backrests with one tube. With small children it is possible to fall out."
4680,"I remember reading these opinions as my mother was diagnosed after a long stay in hospital on Plock pleural mesothelioma. She was diagnosed in Płock for so long that she had metastases on her bones. They delayed the operation for about a month. Our salvation was Mr. Szczylik. During administration of chemistry every three weeks there was always a different doctor, the results of tests were lost somewhere. After the third chemotherapy, the mother finally died. I understand that the chemistry didn't work and the type of cancer was very dangerous, but in such cases I would have hoped for more involvement of the professor. It is worth attributing the winnings in simple cases . Greetings ."
4681,"I'm writing this review while still in the hotel. At first I was a little disappointed in 'em because I asked them for an extra bed in the executive room for the child and a view from the room to the Palace of Culture and Science. There was no extra bed but the staff quickly met my request. Apparently few people read the requests when booking. The view was but from the stadium. It was difficult, but also cool. In addition, all super welcoming drink and nice service. It's another stay in this hotel, I'll be back for Christmas. The room is nice but not as big as the junior suite. The hotel I recommend. I like the Accor chain."
4682,"Hey, my pregnancy is also being led by Dr. Mariak, so far I'm satisfied. It may not be a nice fact and it does not compliment you every step of the way, but I prefer a doctor who is a professional and specialist to a handsome and handsome colleague. It is concrete and factual for me it is very important. In my opinion it is recommendable unless one of you expects compliments and long chats from the doctor."
4683,"Who : Dr Maria Szeloch Course : Basics of management Evaluation : better not : ? [ / b ] Terrible boredom, she almost fell asleep. I don't know how the others, but I honestly didn't take anything out of these classes. The teacher is perhaps nice, but the very form of lecture rejected me."
4684,"pubic hair in the bathroom of the previous occupant, amount of soap and other hotel cleaning agents in the room modest , breakfast very modest , the waiters are not interested in serving guests during breakfast . It is worthwhile to stay in the airport hotel in Warsaw (three stars) to compare the contrast and the disastrous quality offered in the 4-star hotel in Bologna."
4685,"I warn everyone about this dentist! Dr Jarowiecka treated my tooth root canal, but not effectively, because after some time an inflammation occurred. I suspect that the canals were not cleaned well. I was in terrible pain, so I did not take as many pain pills as I did at that time! I reported to her again. However, the doctor's complaint was that she couldn't cure it once again and again the pain was so bad. At the moment she is treating it with another dentist and I am satisfied. I only regret visiting Dr. Jarowiecka because I wasted time, money and above all I suffered! Damn me if I think that such dentists have their offices!"
4686,"I definitely do not recommend the kruger & matz drive 4 or the service ! The panel broke after 2 m - c , fell out of its pocket. Repair 400 PLN and loss of warranty . Then it got worse and worse. After a month on the display white spots, service not recognized. After half a year, the broken device, yes it was repaired courtesy! Now the protective black rubber bands on the edges were glued together. The service doesn't care ! It will not do the service ! ! In short, if it breaks down, it should be thrown away ! There is no chance of a repair ! ! ps . every visit to the service is 14 days and that doesn't mean it will come back repaired ! Mine is less than 10 m - c and 45 days it was in service ! ! Marta"
4687,"Although your doctor is kind, I warn everyone about this doctor! She treated me with Dr. Siemaszko for 2 years. She diagnosed me with diseases which, as it turned out later, she never had m . She prescribes a lot of unnecessary medicines. For a year she gave me (unjustifiably) heavy drugs for bones, as a result of which she spent 2 weeks in the hospital, where I was advised to change my doctor categorically. After consultation with other doctors I do not take any more medication, because as it turns out she never had any of the diseases for which I was treated by Dr. Siemaszko."
4688,"I have mixed feelings. I'm not convinced of your proposed treatment. I've been given very strong medications and I don't think I have such an advanced medical condition. After the visit I had the feeling that the doctor wasn't exactly listening to what I was being treated with and with what effect, maybe that's why I'm not sure about the treatment."
4689,"The most important thing - clean. Tasty breakfasts, served in the dining room in the form of a buffet - cold meat, cheese, jam, flakes, coffee, tea, bread, cucumber + tomato. Coffee and tea are available all day long. The hostel is located on the 7th floor of a high building. Good location in the center of the city, downstairs shop Biedronka. Staff ok . Bed linen is clean . Windows in poor condition . Overall price ok ."
4690,"I don't know why she is mentioned in Krapkowice, after all, she mainly accepts in Kedzierzyn-Kozle. I am from the Shooter's area and I am treating her because there is no laryngologist here who would work in the hospital and would love to operate well. In the ward she asked me for her and I am very satisfied. She made my sinuses and polyps in my nose endoscopically. Before the surgery she told me exactly what awaited me and after the surgery she also occupied me. I recommend the whole ENT department in Koźle and she hasn't met me with such a nice and professional approach yet."
4691,"I had an accident a few kilometers from the hotel, the gentleman from the reception came by car to pick up his wife and child so they wouldn't wait for the trailer - great thing. I arrived with a car on a trailer The gentleman at the gate said he would not let the trailer into the parking lot, that I have to take off the car and push it to the parking space. Absurd. Club open from 22 , cold snacks on site . But to buy something to drink you need to go to the reception and top up your prepaid card. . . . . .a strange solution. The pool door was open outside in September, so a cold wind blew in. I mean, the pool is too much of a mouthful, the so called ""rushing river around"", two slides and a few jacuzzis. And where is the usual recreational pool? In addition, the pool and children's area, here everything is extensive and cool, but also not fully thought out. If a child wants to go down a mini slide, he or she has to go out of the poolBasins outdoors with cold water, so out of season it makes no sense. Rooms like a better guest house or a one-star or two-star hotel. The food is a lot, varied, but the wife found a snail in the salad, when she went outraged to give it to the kitchen, the unshakeable Lord said that the lettuce was not even remorseful in voice. Plus cool playgrounds. On plus evening attractions, a bonfire with sausages and mulled wine, plus music and a ringleader, and after 22nd active disco. Before you check out, you come and check if you stole something from the room. They assume in advance that every man is a thief. It's the first time you've met with something like that."
4692,"For culinary reasons, the hotel lies! I don't know how many times have Christmas Eve products been heated for Christmas breakfasts, but on the second day of the World I had the feeling that someone wants to poison us. With the same hardness of bread that was served for breakfast, my grandmother used to make a bread crumble tart, the yellow cheese so dried up that it was broken, the ham was already feeling and the Christmas Eve, tasteless fish in Greek on the second day of the world without the little one escaped from the plate. Coffee and a famous copy of the louvre only on the hotel's website, very nice anyway. A total lack of organization and professionalism, 5-person room staff had a problem with the implementation of orders for about 15-20 guests. Long waiting time, confusing orders, forgetting and lack of basic juices and spirits in the bar. You can understand the stumbles and shortfalls, but selling people a product that is a package of Christmas obliges to something. I do not recommend!"
4693,"Very professional approach to the customer, comprehensive price offer, flexibility for additional inquiries and calculations, or the final invoice was the most accurate. Nice and efficient service, on a high level, meals varied, tasty and prepared with care. Our customers liked it very much and they will definitely come back here alone to rest. Beautiful surroundings, well maintained area around and view. The hotel was also well thought-out and well planned, it did not feel the presence of other guests. Very good prices for meetings and business conferences."
4694,"This is another stay in Mercure Poznan. As a member of the Le Club Accor loyalty program with Platinum status, I was a little surprised that I was not offered a room upgrade and the occupancy rate was not great. What if I booked em a Privilage room. Some information from the reception desk about the upgrade would have been advisable. When I checked in for the first time, I was given an ID card. It's strange since he booked 'em from his Accor profile. I felt like I was in the People's Republic of Poland, I could identify myself, check and give the key. However, greeting as a Platinum member at the reception is strange. In my profile I've marked a high floor, and the room got em on the 1st floor. That's probably not the high floor? The next thing is the non-functioning internet in the room, the premium internet signal was negligible. The hotel rated 'em as very good because of the breakfasts, which are actually delicious and the location. Although the construction site around the hotel is tedious."
4695,"We were here years ago and it was really great. Unfortunately, it has changed for the category of hotel guests for the worse. The profile of the hotel for weddings, integration events, etc. caused the hotel to deviate from the European standards of hotel guest service. The phone call on the day before arrival that it may be loud until the morning because there is a party downstairs, or the obligation to pay for the stay even before receiving the keys (in Europe it is enough to pre-authorize the card) made them resign from the hotel. We will not come here anymore."
4696,"Anyone can express their opinion today and it is their sacred right. But by ""letting go of"" the internet, we're losing control of them. It's a pity, because with the help of today's application tools, we are able to control a large part of them. Thus, we can build our reputation ourselves. It is known that opinions about the hotel have an impact on its popularity. The broadly understood reputation of a hotel in many communication channels on the Internet has a significant and direct impact on our financial results. Because it correlates with our popularity, interest in our services, occupancy, price level, income and of course potential profit. OTA's booking platforms have completely re-evaluated hotel room sales processes over the last few years. Both online and through traditional channels. They set trends and solutions to which hotels, if they want to remain competitive, unfortunately have to adapt."
4697,"We spent a week in this hotel during the winter holidays. The children came back delighted, but we were much less. First of all the advantages; - great infrastructure for children (swimming pool, playland, animation room, playgrounds, mini zoo), - very well run animations (words of praise to Mr. Peter), the disadvantages: - the biggest disadvantage for us was the exploitation! ! ! We often travel and what we found on the stools is one big disappointment. Definitely the weakest choice of warm dishes is at dinner, but if someone is satisfied with a cold plate, salads or making pancakes for children it will not really disappoint. No coffee and tea for dinner. Desserts in the form of pudding, porridge, jelly, jelly and from time to time some cake are also a novelty for us in this type of facilities. To sum up, you won't go hungry, but whether you're satisfied is an individual matter. . . - in building B the room was nicely renovated, unfortunately the walls are made of paper and you could usually hear the neighbors talking, the TV set on, etc. - the descent to the beach was quite steep ok. 130 stairs, the return is sometimes 'warming up' - the shaded beach in winter, the sun is quite low and unfortunately it hides behind the forest, - for such a huge number of children the hotel offers as many as 6 sledges for rent which caused frustration to some guests and 'night reservations' of them in the room The hotel is just adding a new restaurant, so for the summer season there should be no more problems with waiting for a free table."
4698,"The Doctor has done me the best, the most accurate pregnancy service in my life. ( And I'm in the middle of my second pregnancy and went to different doctors) . She told me exactly what you see on the screen. She was examining calmly, without hurrying, keeping me and my husband informed about what she was doing, what she saw and what it meant. We left the office with the feeling that we were very well informed, well cared for and that we found not only a professional but also a wonderful, warm and witty man. This is important because the usg 11-13 tc is stressful and the patients often feel very bad (this was my case). Since that visit I know that all the next ultrasound examinations will be performed by the doctor."
4699,"The hotel is overrated, the food is poor and collecting ""beakers"" during meals is a massacre like in a soldier's canteen. The rooms are not freshly dirty, there are no towels in the pool, but if we are twice a day, they will not dry out in the room. Generally I do not recommend"
4700,"At the Hotel Faleza we spent with our wife and 2 pets very pleasant moments. The service is very nice and helpful, the restaurant is great, the portions are right, the dishes are perfectly composed. The only drawback is because of the terrain (the hotel lies on a cliff) access to the beach is not very comfortable, but it does not take away the charm of this place. The garden with a view of the sea will appeal to everyone."
4701,"In Nice we stayed at the hotel Le Meurice, which leaves a lot to be desired, we hit on Euro 2016 and room prices were 50% more expensive than normal. . . . .difficult. To start with, the hotel does not have its own car park and the car had to be left in the city car park and go with all the luggage, there are elevators everywhere, so you have to bargain with suitcases, you can book a car park by the hotel, but it is also a weak solution because it is much further away and at the same price, that is 30 euros per day. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a pompous, moderately pleasant receptionist, after checking in, she pointed out to us a ""magic"" stinking lift, which we went to our floor. The door to the room was cardboard, everything could be heard as it turned out at night, because we were hit by noisy British people who were yelling all night and shooting the door. The room itself looks very poorly, certainly not as in the pictures, the wallpaper peels off the walls, in the mini spa bathroom, glued carelessly into place after the old bath, the toilet pressed forcefully between the bath and the wall, a person with a more massive structure would have a problem to use it, not to mention the thicker people. The only advantage is the location, because the hotel is located near the boulevard."
4702,"I didn't get to know the Doctor very well. I waited for 10 minutes in front of the office where there was no patient, and in the end I came in on my own initiative, slightly confused as to why P . The Doctor doesn't ask just sit and wait. The visit lasted maybe 4 - 5 minutes. Diagnosis: ""either bacteria or fungi"" . For my 2-times question if he could do some erasure or something like that, I heard 'em that I don't need to. Result: a prescription for 2 different ointments (probably one for fungi and one for bacteria) and that's it. Did he miss it? : ) I hope that the ointments will be effective. I will honestly say that after a private visit I was expecting a moment of analysis, and here ""either this or that"", I don't know if it is correct to leave a private visit and not know what is wrong with a person. Hmm... . . . .I hope my case was simple enough that maybe it just didn't require swabs and tests. . ."
4703,"It is an ideal place to relax with family, romantic trip for two or a business trip. The hotel is located on a hill near the center, where there is a beautiful view of the port in the palm tree, you can admire it from rooms, restaurants, bar or swimming pool. I don't think there is a better location for a hotel: ) Clean rooms with all the necessary equipment, buffet restaurant, large choice of food, salad bar, meat, fish, and desserts, all fresh and tasty. I like the idea of theme evenings: ladies night, free tango lessons, Mexican cuisine, paella and sangria. By the pool there is a pool bar where you can have a drink, a natural smoothie or cold beer:) there is also a big choice of spirits if someone prefers brandy or whisky. There is also a second bar and other rooms which are available for various meetings or closed parties. the service is very nice and helpful. The hotel is really worth recommending: )"
4704,"Katya spent a week at the hotel with her husband and one and a half year old child. I am very happy with my stay at the hotel and it is possible that I will visit Alanya again. The food is a great plus. The choice is huge, everyone, even very picky will find something for themselves. Dinner/dinner were served in the main canteen and on the balcony to this several tables with sweets and fruit. Between meals, fries, hamburgers, spaghetti, baked (cheese or potatoes), fruit and soft drinks were served on the beach, after lunch, for another dessert, if someone hasn't eaten, or there was little during lunch, at the bottom of the hotel cakes and cookies were served, while before dinner ice cream. In addition, alcohols were served until late hours without any restrictions. The hotel itself is small, which is also one of the advantages, because the canteen or the swimming pool has never been crowded, which takes place in large complexes. The rooms are newly renovated, clean and tidy. Families with children are accommodated in a part of the hotel away from noisy places such as the swimming pool or the amphitheatre, so that the children can sleep in noisy animation hours. The staff is very nice, helpful, clean and unobtrusive. The possibility to go directly to the beach, through a private tunnel below the road, is a great advantage. On the beach itself, free sun loungers and a bar and animations for adults in the afternoon and volleyball. On the headland you can buy a sunbed with a mattress and umbrella for 1Eur per day. Kids from 4 - 12 years old could use the care of animators twice a day. In the back of the hotel there was also a playground with slides and swings, which could be used without restrictions. In the hotel itself, you can feel safe thanks to the security guard who supervised the order and safety 24 hours, there were security guards at the entrance and exit of the facility. You can walk to the city centre on foot for about an hour (in a slow motion), or you can take a bus for 3 TL/axis. The buses run every 10 - 15 minutes. On Mondays and Thursdays, just outside the hotel, there are market stalls where you can buy a variety of Turkish originals at bargain prices.) . Outside these days, every day about 200m from the hotel there are shops where you can get everything you need. I recommend the hotel with full responsibility to all those who want to relax, party people are not likely to go crazy in it. I recommend it again, Maria."
4705,"I recommend to everyone ! I hope that I will avoid injuries to me and my loved ones, but knowing that you can report to this man you live more peacefully. Mr. Marcin got 'em after pulling the plaster off his wrist. He was broken because after 3 . The 5 month of holding my hand in the plaster, I could hardly move my hand, and a very limited rehealing at the NFZ would not help much. Luckily, Mr. Marcin drew up an action plan and after a short period of hard work he managed to regain the full range of movement, for which I will be grateful to him for the rest of his life. You can see that work is also his passion. Professional help for little money - already during rehabilitation I was supposed to suggest to him that he should take more money for what he does, but apparently this was not and is not the most important thing for him. For me, then the student was also very beneficial? ? ? ? I hope there would be more such physiotherapists."
4706,"We have just come back from holidays in the Golden Creek and we find that we will not go back there any more. A facility with potential, but neglected. A large building that used to be a guesthouse, nowadays it's scary and doesn't look like it's being renovated. Cottages poorly cleaned, showers probably not at all. During the holidays we had extra tenants in the form of mice who every day left droppings in the kitchen cabinets and at night we heard them moving around in the attic. The gas stove was broken and there was no telling when the gas was leaking from it. The kitchen was completely unfurnished because we found a tiny frying pan, one burnt pot, a blunt knife and plates. A little to prepare a meal for the family. The boss probably didn't fully understand us because she tried to repair the ""damage"" and thought it was the right thing to do. Mice explained that the cottages are close to the forest and that's how it's going to work. I'm not convinced by that argument. Bringing in extra kitchen equipment was spraying and not very nice. She said that only we were not happy. After talking to the neighbors later, it turned out to be different. I think that if you expect more than 2,000 zloty a week for a house, the conditions should be better. A picturesque but neglected place. I don't recommend for families with children who are still walking in carts, because there is nowhere to go in the village. The beach is dirty with a thin layer of sand. One more thing. The restaurant in the centre is a mistake. Poor menu and you had to wait about 1 hour for pizza. basically, maybe even longer because friends called the order after that time. The service for the number of guests is approx. 17 people close the kitchens and do not accept orders, because allegedly they do not make it. That's probably it. It could be beautiful, but somebody probably wants to make a profit by investing little."
4707,"Internal demand is growing, the number of guests from abroad is growing, but at least for the time being the number of hotels and hotel rooms is growing faster than the number of guests who would like to stay overnight in them. Will such a dynamic expansion of the hotel base at an estimated cost of PLN 5.5 - 6 billion bring the expected profit to hoteliers and investors? Will the guests be able to provide the facilities with appropriate use and revenues allowing not only to maintain profitability but also profit? Yes, but not in all hotels."
4708,"When I give birth, I'll write a lot of interesting things about this doctor's practices - she changed my doctor at the end of the 8th month, it was very difficult for me but I don't regret it - women check well who you get to because the nice surroundings are very insidious and I sign what ann wrote"
4710,"I recommend visiting your doctor. Please be patient and follow the doctor's instructions and, if possible, your awaited child will be lying next to you as now. Nobody promises you that it will be easy and fast but Dr. Paul will surely do everything to fulfill your dreams . I have finished my treatment in Gamet and I guess I will miss the visits to this place and meetings with Doctor ."
4712,"It requires a lot, almost in every class he makes cards - difficult, there is no chance that he will not take to the board. To pass the circle you must first pass all the cards (if you don't pass, you can write the circle, but you won't know the result until you pass it). The same goes for the exam. The truth is that it's not as bad as they write about it. If you go to his office, you will finally pass. The important thing is that you understand this, and Mr. Rusek prefers to hear his version of the definition when answering, because he does not pass others. For those who are serious about physics, he is good and can teach you to count difficult things. Anyway, in him 3 is better than in others 4 or 5, who are not: ) he will not teach much. It is known that the appearance of the index is important, but knowledge is more important."
4713,"Unfortunately, or maybe even hundreds, I give your doctor's opinion VERYOOOOOO but it is VERYOOOO NEGATIVE. In the 12th week of pregnancy I was sent to Ikar clinic in Bydgoszcz for prenatal examinations! ! ! ! When she came to me for the results, the doctor said that they were bad and recommended amniocentesis ! ! ! She didn't explain what to do or how to do it as soon as she had an appointment for an amniocentesis! Thank God in the office next door the gynecologist examined the child again and found that there is no need for such a procedure because the child is healthy and has no Down's syndrome! ! At that time, the doctor interfered very badly with the gynaecologist's opinion until she herself drew her attention and then she became silent! When we came back to her office, she said that the elevated protein may indicate pregnancy diabetes, and here is the whole dog is buried because during the interview before taking blood, the doctor forgot to ask about such an important thing that is pregnancy diabetes because it changes the test results and I had her from 7 weeks of pregnancy. My nightmare, which she lived through to the day of my birth is indescribable ! I wish the doctor with all my heart for the future ! ! ! ! ! !"
4714,"The hotel has turned out to be worse than other reviewers on this website mention it. The food is very average, the room is boring, the offer of the spa is modest and so is the professional service in the spa. The reception and restaurant service was very friendly. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the cleanliness of the room - it could have been better. We paid a bit for the quality, but the location was great."
4715,"That was my second visit to Dr. Gerlach. Dr. Gerlach impressed me with his calm and professionalism. After 1 visit and prescription of medicines, I felt a clear improvement and the pain in my knee alleviated. She also received a handful of advice on what to do to make it less painful. I am satisfied with this visit. I recommend it."
4716,"This is a doctor who goes with the progress of medicine and does not stand still, he can help in cases when it is really bad, when other doctors spread their hands. Even if he is not able to cure it is directed to good and competent specialists. He has not let me down. Commentary wrote: Józef Przybylski"
4717,"I strongly advise against this gentleman. All he can say is that he can offer a manual therapist, in the same clinic of course. Completely disregard the symptoms of the disease signaled by me. When she told me about my ailments, the gentleman was looking at the watch, because it only has 15 minutes for the patient. I was treated with disregard and about the alleged pain he said that I think I feel it so strongly and advised to go to a psychologist, of course, the floor below. A month after that visit, she stopped walking. With the illness I was diagnosed with, she was very lucky that the manual therapist did not hurt me because you cannot manipulate my illness because of the high risk of damage to my spine. The doctor should direct me to the examination after signaling the symptoms of the disease instead of directing me straight to the therapist and psychologist. Lost valuable time, lost money and only getting a lot of pain from the therapy. I do not recommend."
4718,"You had to read the book to get the credit : ! On the basis of which you had to write an essay: shock: Not much, it had to be written by yourself (control system by authorship: x) Doctor baaardzo wanted to persuade us to take an active part, loves to argue, unfortunately my group was moderately willing to cooperate: ) However, the lectures themselves were interesting and although he enrolled 'em with the thought of sleeping at that time, he listened carefully to 'em at almost every class! However, the bummies will be dissatisfied. . ."
4719,"Park Apartments in Szczawnica is a hotel that we have been visiting for several years. We are always satisfied with the conditions, service and location. Spacious, also two-room apartments (in some of them a kitchenette) provide comfort of rest after a day-long touristic activities. Breakfast could be a little more varied. In summer and winter there is something to do, and the town is charming and tourist-friendly. We will still come here."
4720,"Stress-free, in a good atmosphere, without tension (for someone who is afraid of the needle it is not without meaning), with caution not to move his teeth, when there is no certainty that you have to, without waiting in the waiting room, with a very individual approach. I recommend the office to everyone. I have been treating Dr. Dawidowicz for 7 years. You do not change specialists: )"
4721,"I don't know where the buzzing name ""Pension"" comes from. Nothing agrees with what you see in the pictures, (probably taken with a good program) . Dirt that she has not seen anywhere else m ! Old furniture, no possibility of unpacking luggage, old and stinky bedding, one socket for the room, a mushroom by the balcony, cold radiators at night, no hot water in the evening. Also dirty windows and balconies. Breakfast at the slightest resistance line. Fat lunches, nothing regional. Benches by the barbecue black with dirt . No interest from owners ."
4723,"The stay in Hallmark hotel was very pleasant : ) Parking is free. We were pleasantly surprised by the room was impeccably clean and the modern design. The room is equipped with a plasma TV, coffee and tea maker, iron. The room is air-conditioned. The employees were very friendly and courteous. Easy access by train to London Victoria station (40 minutes travel time). Croydon Station is 15 minutes walk away. We'll be back there for sure."
4724,"I have been thinking for a long time about choosing a roaster for home use. Eventually, I decided to use a Kettler Coach M, I already have a bicycle of the same company at home. Unfortunately, when I bought it in the shop, I let 'em get a York r301 roaster. He writes unfortunately because after 1 or 5 months of use the bench creaks, the seat was unscrewed and the head of the screw scratched the guide and the adjustable foot pad broke in half at heel level. . . OK, it happens, I dismantled 'em the rooker, took 'em off the seat, tightened 'em all the screws, folded 'em back, squeak will survive. He took 'em also a foot pad and went with it to the importer of York equipment, where there is also a service. At the service, however, I was treated 'em with a shoe and I was told that the crack was mechanical damage because I was using a roaster incorrectly. I tried to ask myself what the improper use would be and it turned out that I was holding my foot wrong. When I tried to explain that only one pad broke, and there are two, it is probably not a question of holding one foot and the other correctly? ! He heard me say that I can buy a second pad for 20 PLN. For this reason I do not recommend buying it either because of the above faults or because of the arrogant service."
4725,"hotel located in a good location 10 minutes walk from the beach niche beachplaces nice, cleaned daily although not always changed towels. maids not speaking English lack communication. The food is unfortunately hopeless sometimes you have to go out because there is nothing to eat especially for lunch and dinner. . . . .the best bar by the pool a great bartender sylvia . Drinks at the all-inclusive form for many cocktails you have to pay for as well as for some dishes, which in my opinion is not allowed.good beer only in the pool bar. In the hotel bar, dirty wires in the distributor smells of beer! ! ! Good service. The evening's hopeless singing only twice in 11 evenings you could have a laugh. air conditioning in the rooms hardly works at all. General impressions not interesting would certainly not come back to this hotel and I do not recommend it"
4727,"She underwent my upper eyelid correction surgery with Dr. Ibrahim over a year ago. The operation resulted in a slight improvement in the appearance of the eyelids (far from expected) and the side effect is very large scars. On the left eye the scar reaches the temples! ! ! It was my first and only plastic surgery, so I did not know exactly what to expect. The preoperative consultation was hasty. The receptionist informed me before the surgery that I was going to get a blue pill for indifference, but nobody gave it to me. Generally there was an atmosphere of rush and lack of organization in the clinic. During the operation the doctor was assisted by nurses who did not speak Polish at all and poorly English, so the communication was very difficult. They pressed my eyes very hard to take out the fat bags, she had to ask the doctor to pay attention to them. The doctor intervened, but she had bruises all month long. But it's nothing. The worst part is that my eyelids look as if they were accidentally cut. The scars vary in location and length. Now I have atrophic scars on my eyelids going towards my temples, they are uneven, one is longer and lies higher than the other. With such extensive scars, no make-up, not even a specialist corrective one, helps. I have been trying laser treatments, creams, ointments, etc. for over a year. Unfortunately, all this has only helped a little. Inevitably there will be a revision procedure. Dr. Ibrahim did not show any willingness to help after the situation. He said it was my fault because I have a collagen production disorder. 3 doctors of surgeons where I was consulted on the revision surgery, did not confirm his opinion. I do not recommend this doctor or the Mandala clinic."

4729,"When booking a room in a 4 * hotel in the very centre of Wrocław, the price of which was not among the lowest ones, I expected something more. The price of the hotel was not one of the lowest, and he expected more. Meanwhile, for not little money, he got 'em a room that was not cleaned up properly, which smelled of tobacco smoke until the end of our weekend stay. In response to my request for a room change, he heard 'em that the hotel is over - booked during the weekend. The Qubus Hotel unfortunately confirms a rumour that when on the eve of the European Football Championship there were no hotels of a suitable standard in the cities of the organizers, stars were given out in Poznan and Wroclaw."
4730,"Mrs. Jagna is the third nutritionist with whom he started working with em, decided to write this opinion because the results that em achieved are more than satisfactory. He thought to 'em that I've been articulated three times and am very pleased with my choice. First of all the reliable knowledge that distinguishes Mrs. Jagna from those dieticians with whom he has worked with em. I think what matters here is that Mrs. Jagna is a Medical Dietician after Gdansk Medical University. Secondly, the ability to read needs and preferences. I know that I was not one of the simple cases - hypercholesterolemia and diabetes and irregular meals. This opinion is a thanks to you for making me feel 10 years younger than I used to be."
4731,"19 . 07 . I had the opportunity to use the Rukola restaurant at the Hotel Morawa . Because of the disease I am forced to follow strictly the gluten-free diet, she chose me this facility as part of the Menu without Gluten, under which the restaurants are trained in the diet. Earlier she also wrote me an email to make sure that the facility is participating in the program and received me confirmation that the restaurant is serving gluten-free dishes. Unfortunately, after a long journey to the resort, I was surprised: there was no menu with marked dishes safe for people on a diet, and the waitresses made big eyes on the question about gluten-free dishes. Eventually, the ""chef will come up with something"". This is not how the preparation by the participating centers looks like. I'll add that after the meal she felt bad for several hours. A very unpleasant surprise and a lot of stress."
4732,"In the last place, at the top of the pyramid, there are fats whose consumption should be limited, especially animal fats. ""Since 1992 the consumption of animal fats in the diet of Poles has fallen, which is beneficial, but at the same time the consumption of vegetable fats has increased alarmingly,"" said prof . Jarosz said . According to the data of the Food and Nutrition Institute, the total fat consumption in our country has tripled, which contributed to the increase in overweight and obesity. ""Overweight and obese children are three or four times more overweight and obese than over 20 years ago. Most of them are in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, where almost every third teenager aged 10-15 years has problems with the carcass"" - added prof . Jarosz ."
4733,"1 . It is cold in the sauna. The existing ceiling heaters do not work at all . Saving energy at the expense of guest comfort? The staff is dressed in sweaters and the guests in towels are to be warm2 . The level of customer service is embarrassing. The staff seems to be there for themselves and the customer only interferes with the conversations and gossip3 . Hygiene - the staff walking in normal clothing, winter boots and carrying dirt from outside. The sight of an employee walking in trappers among people barefoot is terrifying. Not to mention the fact that it is very easy to introduce a piece of glass, a stone which can then injure guests. The facility looks like it wouldn't have any manager, and it's a shame because this place used to be much better kept. I hope the owner will motivate the crew to call this place ""thermal"" and not a washroom."
4734,"Although the chip is only 5 by 5 mm in size, its functionality and accuracy of measurements are comparable to that of professional medical equipment - for example, a patient wearing an ECG-registration tug. It is enough to attach several electrodes to record a variety of parameters - for example, the electrodes on the chest allow to receive impulses from the breathing muscles. Various types of smart wristbands are usually only equipped with a heart rate sensor and an accelerometer.

4736,"She has just returned from the Flora motel in Łódź, 111 Szczecińska Street. She has never been in a worse place, the surroundings are nice, while Mr. Owner - KOSZMAR . They paid us earlier for our stay, they couldn't withdraw and I think it gave you courage, at all costs they wanted to throw us out of the hotel garden, because a more affluent guest appeared, the Russians - dog exhibitors. We were frowned upon for ordering pizza (of course they asked us if we could order ""something"" in the motel restaurant). A year earlier, ladies in my company were selling sandwiches and now they called themselves RESTAURATORS. You have to deserve a place in life. The manager apologized for the brazen work of the employees, but nothing is able to compensate for my bad mood. The ladies at the reception desk - wonderful and what of it? I definitely do not recommend ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
4737,"Although this was the first visit and I do not yet know the effects of the treatment, I think that the doctor is very factual, he is professional in his approach to the subject, he does not mention the ""heaviest department"" from the very beginning, without knowing the issue, he has empathy, which is not a common thing among doctors. Generally I recommend."
4738,"This cooling would have the highest rating with me if it wasn't for the fan. I have known these fans for many years. Before, they were extremely quiet, that is, even at maximum speed, only air noise could be heard. Nowadays in 12 cm T-type fans you can hear buzzing from 900 O per minute. The first fan gave 'em a name. The second one behaves a bit better, but it is also loud. So he replaced 'em with a higher model SILENT WINGS 2 PWM 12 cm . It's still buzzing. The old two-foot fan is not buzzing."
4739,"Before the treatment Mr. Fidyk was partially paralyzed for almost two years and despite many months of rehabilitation his condition did not improve. The rehabilitation - five hours of exercise five times a week - was continued after the transplantation in the ""Akson"" Neurorehabilitation Department in Wrocław. Three months after the operation the patient noticed that his left thigh was becoming more muscular. After six months - describes the BBC - supported by a physiotherapist took the first steps. Two years after the surgery he can already go outside the rehabilitation centre using a balcony and hopes to function independently. He partially regained control over his bladder and stooling, his sexual functions have also returned. The MRI confirmed that the gap in the core has closed."
4740,"The visits to your doctor are always too short for me. You seem to ask the doctor, but it's all in such a form of rush, a little nervous. There's always an ultrasound done. The price of the visit is terribly high, 180 PLN for up to 10 minutes. . . . . . I lack such a holistic approach, commissioning research - in case of miscarriages it is extremely important . Unfortunately, I don't have such a helpful hand - according to the doctor, everything is ok. Everything else is fine, so much so that I recommend the doctor to my colleagues, which I do rarely. I don't have a thyroid, maybe that's why my visits don't last that long. I give a good grade. Greetings."
4741,"I've reported to Mr. Dr. . Głowacki about 2 years ago with big bay problems. Earlier treatment and Fess procedure did not give results . The doctor performed a total of three procedures: nasal septum straightening, tonsil removal and sinus FESS with widening of sinus estuaries and unblocking the sinus. Each of the procedures sooner or later brought positive results. The headaches stopped, I can breathe much better thanks to the simple nasal septum and speak better thanks to the removed tonsils. First of all, Mr. Dr. . Głowacki carries out the procedures very little invasive and most importantly he does not put tamponade into the nose after the surgery, thanks to that the same ailments after the surgery are much less. I have a comparison with a FESS procedure in another hospital after which I recovered for 4 weeks. For example, after the procedure of straightening the nasal septum only a few stitches are left to be removed, the nose is not clogged, there is little bleeding and so on. The same way after the FESS treatment, despite the bleeding nose, I could still breathe. No tampons, blocked nose, sleepless nights, etc. It is a great convenience for the patient because most of them are afraid of ailments after the procedure and it turns out that they are not so troublesome. In addition, the Doctor also looks at the sinuses after the surgery with an endoscope which was not in another hospital. If someone has serious laryngological problems and needs surgical treatment, I can recommend the doctor with a clear conscience. Głowacki ."
4742,"When she got to Mr. Luke freshly after the surgery, she couldn't practically move her hand. When she left the surgery, she had my hand back: ) Mr. Luke not only helped me physically - he skillfully started my hand, but also helped me to overcome the mental blockade and the fear of moving my hand. He also suggested using a laser to help me get back in shape faster. I know one thing - better hit couldn't m ! Thank you Mr. Lukasz and I will recommend you to my friends as an excellent physiotherapist with a unique approach to patients."
4743,"She was at Dr. . Wincewicz, I don't know where those malicious remarks come from. . . . .if the doctor wasn't nice to someone, then apparently that someone has earned it himself. . . .professional, nice and specific. For me personally, a big advantage is also that he knows my former doctor Dr. Wincewicz well. Medard Lech, who is unrivalled. I wonder if these negative opinions are sincere. . . . .probably again the competition writes nonsense like many other doctors. . ."
4744,"It is based on a good organization of the system operating around the clock and on specialists - the patient is to be admitted to the center of invasive cardiology as soon as possible, where he undergoes the procedure with the use of a vascular catheter. Doctors use the catheter to make the procedure more efficient due to atherosclerosis of the vessel. They also introduce stents which strengthen the vessels at the point of stenosis and sometimes release drugs. As emphasized by the Director of Medical Affairs of the Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases in Zabrze prof . Piotr Przybyłowski, the implementation of this model was one of the great leaps of civilization in Polish medicine. ""It happened in 1987. It was one of the first, actually the second in Europe, 24-hour infarction treatment programme. It was one of the first, actually the second in Europe to have a 24-hour treatment programme for myocardial infarction, and by that time the patients had spent up to 6 weeks in bed, since then modern treatment had begun,"" he said."
4745,"We went to the Ash Villa for a family weeekend. The rooms are nicely decorated and clean. Breakfast included in the price was abundant and tasty - a typical Swedish table. There is a separate playroom for children. Things that may be disturbing are the thin walls, so you can hear all the conversations of the guests next door, and the lack of curtains / blinds in the windows which in the morning can be very disturbing. Unless it's a deliberate procedure not to sleep for breakfast. There is no restaurant in the guesthouse and rather no kitchenette in the rooms (probably in one room). The guesthouse is located within easy reach of larger slopes and tourist attractions such as Zakopane and Morskie Oko. Generally a very nice place to recommend."
4746,"The hotel is mainly aimed at families with children and it is worth remembering this before choosing your holiday destination. If you want a total chill out, you will not experience peace and quiet. Eating ok , but not brilliant . Theme evenings focused on the striped birds. She tried to take advantage of me, but I did not like much. The pool bar (not in the aqua park area) offers pizza, toast, sandwiches and 2 kinds of takeaway salads, a lot of barbecue HP sauce.) ) . Lots of Polish families and Englishmen. The kitchen had to satisfy their specific, absorbent, carbohydrate-fat palates, but not mine. Design rooms, white and gray. Clean, but not shiny. Children, joy, screaming omnipresent, playing in the front aquapark. Staff from the lands adjacent to Greece, exceptionally educated people, mathematicians, historians, future doctors. . . . .sometimes, I was overwhelmed by the feeling of regret that in Greece they carry luggage, serve at tables and in the bar. A great team, I still miss them and watch them on FB: ) Mediterranean hotel climate . It is not a moloch, rather intimate. Alcohol is modest in the offer all inclusive generally modest. Prices in the season reach the zenith, but May / June or September / October certainly worth taking the kids here and play with them. Beach by the hotel none . The road to it through the olive grove charming . I recommend, but you should consider a visit against other offers. However, the island itself, Zakynthos can bring a lot of fun, it is not worth looking for it in the number of hotel stars, because you can not count it. . haha ."
4747,"We were in the hotel in February 2015, good for short stays (we were staying for 2 days). The room is extremely small with a shower and washbasin inside the room, toilet separately. With the window open quite a lot of noise from the street but after closing almost nothing can be heard. Rooms cleaned daily and towels changed. Definitely too small pillows. What I missed was a normal glass / mug in the room and at least a small electric kettle. You can get boiling water at the hotel reception. Good to take a pap for cold feet ( laminated floor ) . No shower gel, shampoo, only 2 small soaps by the sink. Breakfasts were not used by us because the price of 26 PLN is rather too expensive. Nearby there is a shop so we chose to have breakfast by ourselves. In the ratings somewhere someone wrote that you can get to the Copernicus Center in 20 minutes on foot, which is total nonsense and probably not to this Ibis gave a rating. The hotel is located in the OCHOCIE area at the western railway station and we took the bus almost an hour (at 15 on Friday) to PRAGA. The bus stops are not far from the hotel and the West Railway Station (here it is better to get to the center - line 136, 158). The hotel is good because we paid a lower price and that is why the hotel looks ok for a one-star standard. The entrance to the hotel is at the back of the building."
4748,"If it weren't for common sense, I'd probably be crippled. It started with a private visit ( 100PLN ) not longer than five minutes. Earlier she called me at the hospital and wanted me to make an appointment for a consultation, but the waiting time was too long, especially since she had a suspected pituitary tumor. That's why she decided to pay me a private visit to the Chief Executive. She looked at the results very quickly and said that from next week on I could come to the hospital for a two-week examination. I had a couple of tests done at the hospital and instead of focusing on my real problem, the Chief Executive started telling me that I had anorexia, without a prior interview and without any tests. When I first left the hospital, I had no hope of ever getting pregnant. The Chief Executive said that I am infertile and that I can say goodbye to the children. Besides, according to Dr. Tuchendler, I have a secondary functional hyperprolactinemia. I didn't get an MRI, but it was found that I don't have a tumor. Besides, of course the Chief Executive insisted on anorexia. The first time I ended up giving me a norepinephrine and she was supposed to report me after six months. The second time she got me to the hospital after 6 months. Before that, however, she reported me to Dr. Bocheńska (one of the best therapists when it comes to food problems) who, after talking to me, said that there is nothing to fear and I have no symptoms of anorexia. In the hospital I had a series of tests, unfortunately without an MRI. The prolactin was still above the norm, while the headmaster at the discharge prescribed me steroids (she said not to read the leaflet because I might be scared), some kind of appetite agent (in connection with my alleged anorexia) and still taking norprolactin (as it turned out later, it should not be taken longer than six months). After two weeks in hospital and such a diagnosis, my patience and understanding for Mrs. Tuchendler ended. She changed my doctor to Dr. Szymczak, who ruled out steroids (they were to work on my adrenal glands, which I have healthy), prescribing me only progesterone. What can defend my statement . . . maybe it is that after 3 months Mrs. Szymczak got me pregnant, and for the last two months I am a mother of a healthy, big and beautiful daughter. I sincerely discourage Dr. Tuchendler as a specialist and a man ( cold, unpleasant ) . Maybe she is disappointed with her daddy's previous military career. . ."
4749,"After leaving your doctor he was disgusted and even outraged. For the pain in the knee, he did not order any tests, he said only that he knows the disease and recommends starting treatment with a series of expensive knee injections (400 PLN one). He then added that he is an entrepreneur and that he is able to arrange these injections a little cheaper if I am interested. I as a layman know that the treatment starts with research, oral medicine and rehabilitation and not immediately with interference in the knee of expensive injections. This is what I got 'em doing when I went to another orthopedist who, from the first visit, wanted to help me and not make money from my suffering."
4750,"I want to highly recommend Dr. . Wojciech Ziêtala , because in my opinion he is a high-class professional and a very caring man. Even before the visit, it was easy to notice not only the high personal culture of the doctor, but also his serene disposition. During the visit he listens tactfully, selects words skilfully and is ready to give comprehensive answers. In the meantime, he takes precise notes. He draws conclusions aloud to confront them with the patient's feelings and confirm them. Once the diagnosis has been established, he clearly describes the medicine he has chosen, its effects and warns of possible side effects. In my case, an additional fast-acting drug was needed. Finally, the doctor also writes a helpful note with instructions for the patient. Greetings"

Good food, breakfast from 6. At 00, those departing earlier receive breakfast on the road. Sauna (bathrobe and slippers in the room), summer outdoor pool. Very nice and helpful service."
4754,"The high quality of workmanship, simplicity of use, huge capacity was slightly overshadowed by the lack of basic accessories such as a cover and a base for ground and earthy surfaces. The base in the set must be concreted, which was not acceptable for me. I also find it difficult to find a round hole in the dryer after it has been folded. To prevent water from spilling inside I seal it with foamed polystyrene from the package. The dryer's arms must be hand-corrected to compensate for not a few mm differences in the fit of the wings immediately after folding . Fold and unfold without any problems . However, the price is high and other accessories must be purchased. It did not meet my high requirements."
4755,"The hotel in its name has, in addition to a SPA training centre, which means that there may be colonies in it. And so it was during our stay. Children like this children had a great time running around the corridors visiting and slamming the door. Only the colonists had rooms with a view, which completely hanged them. We had a view of the playground and the so-called smokehouse where parties were held. You can dream about peace and quiet. During a week-long stay, for three days the swimming pool was excluded from the attractions as they exchanged water. Breakfast buffet is quite ok, you can choose something for yourself but dinner is unfortunately a strange thing, soup and a second dish imposed by the chef. I sympathize with the people who come here and will lose their nerves. The service is nice, the canteen is ok and at the reception desk they made a good face for a bad game."
4756,"I came 'em to your dentist to remove the gap with the cavity between 4 and 5 at the top right . She managed quite well to remove the cavity, which is unfortunately, after 3 attempts to remove the gap, when it did not come out, she gave up. I found out that if the gap will bother me I have to come again. After the visit to make sure I wrote 'em on the email given on the website of the Dentist asking if the visit again in connection with the fact that I failed the first time will be paid extra. I didn't get em an answer. After a week, he asked 'em again. It has already been 12 days and still remains unanswered . Your dentist still has time off for the Famous Doctor, so I assume that the lack of an answer is not due to vacation ."
4757,"The doctor is very kind and kind, she examines thoroughly, but she doesn't do any special interviews, she went only because my regular doctor was outside Krakow and the child was coughing for 4 days. After the examination, she prescribes an antibolic with a note that large changes on the bronchi and immediately must be given. I have been a mother for 6 years, only once she gave m the antibiotic, but the child was actually in a tragic condition, 40 degrees of fever, flying through the hands (after vaccination). On the second day, she was scared and she landed me at her doctor's, who after a thorough examination did not find any disturbing changes. The cough is most probably caused by teething (5 teeth come out simultaneously). This was my first and last visit: ("
4759,"It is not evenly distributed throughout the country, but it is concentrated around places that are attractive for tourists or business - usually where there is a shortage of places: e.g. in the season or periodically, e.g. due to large trade fair events - Poznań. In tourist areas, the ""grey zone"" is mainly Zakopane and its surroundings, the area of the Tri-City and Gulf of Gdansk, Western Pomerania, and to a lesser extent the mountain range in Lower Silesia. In business areas, the ""grey zone"" is Warsaw and satellite towns."

As if they were not looking for the only information on the door is that today a highlander band is playing, although again the disinformation played the day before, about the opening hours of the premises zero information unless it is about the waitress who will explain what you can take with you. I do not recommend this was my last visit and I think a few clients from the tables next door."
4761,"We are quite choosy, but at the Marina Club Hotel it is difficult to get attached to something. The hotel service is great, both the reception desk, restaurant, staff. The hotel is nice and clean. The food is brilliant, both from the buffet and from the card. Beautiful location. The only drawback we've noticed is the low sound level door in the rooms. In the morning it's hard to sleep longer when someone in the hallway is talking loudly passing by. A few days earlier we had spent 4 nights in Warmia Theatres, so after coming to the Forces we took a deep breath and finally ate some sensible meal, rested in air-conditioned rooms without a cloud of flies. We will certainly return to the Marina next year."
4762,"Tastefully decorated and designed hotel. Quite far from the ""center"" which may seem like an advantage, but for others 3km to the pier and other entertainment may be too far away. Indeed, right by the sea. Great jacuzzi outside, nice sauna area. Interestingly decorated room with a tiny but useful loggia. Beautiful sea view from the 6th floor cafe and the restaurant at breakfast. What is the problem? At 5 * you would expect perfection, and here you can clearly see that a lot of effort has been put into the design and furnishing of the hotel, and already happens little carelessness (cracked joints in the bathroom, hotel information on a messy photocopier, a menu in the cafe glued with adhesive tape, a reckless issue with cards in the pool). This does not particularly reduce comfort, but spoils the very nice impression of the hotel as a whole. With less burdensome topics: small and uncomfortable parking in front of the hotel, quite a modest pool."

Beautiful, charming beach with the possibility of ordering pizza. A very nice playground with blowjobs available for the little ones and a lot of space for walks with children. I recommend and I will definitely return to the Promenade : - ) The ladies at the reception desk have provided us with a playroom for children."
4765,"Before the visit to Mrs. Drzewiecka, she read the comments, but despite the predominance of negative opinions, she decided to go to this lady (I cared about the homeopath). Unfortunately, the visit confirmed these opinions. The doctor probably actually confused the profession. The child was examined quickly and reluctantly. To my question about the gums and teeth she answered: ""and what do you want from me with these teeth (she meant parents in general), I won't bother her there""? ! To the more serious questions about my child's health and the question about the vaccine she heard m - "" and because I know ? "" To sum up, it's a waste of time and money for a visit. She had to make an appointment with another doctor because she did not find out anything concrete from this lady I left with my husband disgusted. I'm surprised the CMD hired such a doctor."
4766,"In 2012 she came to the hotel with her family. There were still 4 stars. Everything was fine. They promised us we'd come back here. In 2014, they dropped 1 star. It was terrible. They removed one pool and the trampoline in the playroom was closed. Worse still, a mushroom grew in the bath room. The beds were awkward. I'll add that the pool smelled of chlorine. The attractions were great. The food was very ""poor. "" Everything was taped. The carpet in the lobby didn't see a vacuum cleaner. The bowling alley was broken.

Imagine that this woman has - 5% in the ranking! ! ! Very helpful this portal : - )"
4768,"Opinions about hotels published by social media do not give a true picture of guest satisfaction because they present a distorted, too negative image of hotels, according to an analysis carried out by the research company Market Metrix. Social media bring 300% more negative opinions and only 35% more positive opinions than in traditional surveys, concludes Market Metrix . If the opinions from social media were suggested by guests only, the problem would exist, but it would not be so serious. However, as Jonathan Barsky, Director of Research at Market Metrix, points out: ""The problem is that many hotels use customer reviews published in social media to make important business decisions. When hotel management makes decisions about allocating expenses based on erroneous information, it can result in millions of dollars in losses. Without a true picture of guest satisfaction, it is possible to misdefine the areas requiring support and direct the investment to what in fact in no way translates into increased guest satisfaction and therefore has no impact on the development of a single hotel or hotel chain. At the same time the areas of activity that actually attract guests and increase their loyalty remain unnoticed."
4769,"The disadvantage of this mug is that when you drink it, everything pours out on your baby's tummy. It's just that too much liquid escapes from the mug and the baby can't swallow everything. So I don't know how this mug is supposed to teach the child to drink by himself. . . Our son is 15 months old. Until now he has been drinking from a bottle with a silicone mouthpiece, which he kept on his own, or from an ordinary plastic cup, which I kept on his mug and then he would get enough liquid in his mouth and nothing would spill. Each of our attempts with this cup ends with a wet blouse. . . Unfortunately, we will not use it anymore. She paid m for it 38 zloty with pennies : - / /"
4770,"I have a completely different opinion. The visit was unpleasant, the doctor was disrespectful and spraying. I came to his place to take out a tiny piece of glass, a millimetre in size, and I came out with deep cuts and stitches. After a month, when the wound finally healed, but the pain did not go away, I went to another doctor - it turned out that the glass was still stuck. She definitely wouldn't go to that doctor for the second time."
4771,"Since it is not required to take the initiative itself, but to implement delegated solutions in advance. If they are ineffective, the responsibility lies with the contractor, not the originator. In this way, instead of using solutions with the expertise - often expensive - of a specialist, it becomes the scapegoat of unproven solutions ""boss"". Actually, I have always had such discord and it does not only concern the hotel industry. If I can afford (in the sense of the owner) a specialist and employ him, why don't I let him work according to his competences? This way I lose my own time and money as if twice as much. And the employee was hired just to save me that. But let's go back to the owners' directors."
4772,"The hotel is situated in a quiet place, surrounded by forests. The rooms are nice, new and clean. The hotel has many amenities and will do its best to entertain its customers in every way. There is a large outdoor swimming pool, an indoor swimming pool, a spa, a salty pool, a playing field, a music club with a bar, billiards, bicycles, fishing in a specially prepared pond, and everyone will find something for themselves. Meals served at the hotel are very tasty and contain regional products. Breakfast is served as a Swedish table. I highly recommend"
4773,I had varicose veins of seminal cordage on both sides in a serious stage. Quickly treatable. I came to the hospital for another reason. My testicle twisted. . . With a twisted testicle helped but did not even mention these varicose veins. Another urologist was surprised that the doctor didn't say anything. I don't recommend visiting this doctor. He sees selectively.
4774,"In the Patient's Rights category the prize was awarded to the Office of the Ombudsman. As Adam Bodnar, who is in charge of it, stressed, it will encourage further work, especially as there are several areas of judicial psychiatry in which the Ombudsman Office is interested. ""This is, among other things, the issue of the application of protective measures and the entire regulatory environment related to it. It still happens that people who should never be in custody and prisons land there instead of in psychiatric hospitals. A major challenge is the functioning of the National Centre for Dissocial Behaviour Prevention in Gostynin, which is increasingly affected by legal complaints and concerns; how to put Gostynin under better regulatory control and protect the rights of those who are there or will be there in the future,"" he stressed."
4775,"The Doctor said without a moment's hesitation: it's a waste of time to be sick and he would like to inject (injections) of steroids into my knee - which in his opinion will help so quickly that the next day I will be healthy. The Doctor does not focus on eliminating the inflammation, the source of pain, but he is a supporter, I would call it ""soaping"". After the visit I have a bad impression. In addition, the visit lasts for a short time, it examines quickly and superficially, the doctor does not listen. His advantage is that at least he is polite."
4777,"I have already had the pleasure of hosting Ryn Castle Hotel several times during my business trips. The very nice experiences associated with these stays have decided to spend part of their holidays in this hotel. The great location has already been written a lot of words, impressive appearance, I wanted to make me special thanks to the hotel staff. The hotel's reception desk is very professional and very friendly, and the restaurant's staff is very professional, but also very friendly - once again, with thanks to Mrs. Mart, Mrs. Ania, Mrs. Justyna and Mrs. Olga - an apprentice, but no doubt he will be an excellent employee, a member of the crew wherever he goes. In the recreation center Ms. Monika - thanks also to the other employees. The rooms are not too big, but functional. We plan to come back next year."
4779,"There is less than a more dynamic expansion of large hotel chains in Europe and European hotel chains in Europe. Poland as a part of Europe is less penetrated by both international and domestic chains and is also subject to this expansion. Recently especially in the economic segment. This does not mean that the ""heads"" of all independent hotels are being sought by 4 - 5 candidates offering franchise reception or management."
4780,"I do not recommend Dr. Drzewicki . He was leading my first pregnancy and she almost lost my baby. My son was born in asphyxia only because the doctor didn't want to perform a caesarean section, because he probably couldn't and pushed the baby out by force and with the help of vacum. She gave birth for 21 hours and in medical books it is written that after 18 hours it is advisable to have a C-section. Maybe he did not read it to himself. That is why I claim that it is better to treat with someone who is a professional with a lot of experience, and such a doctor is Dr . Homa, in whom she gave birth to two more children through the Caesarean. If you don't want your baby to die in childbirth, don't choose this doctor! ! ! ! ! ! !"
4781,"Personally, I was not satisfied with the visits and treatment of Dr. Markuszewski . After 6 mc treatment with the previously described globules and suppositories my problems did not disappear. It took 1.5 mc to cure my problems completely and irreversibly to another doctor. Today I have the impression that Mr. Dr. Markuszewski cures civilization diseases in most cases, forgetting that nowadays it is difficult for women to wear only skirts, cotton underwear, not to mention the ban on wearing tights : ) In addition, after each visit, I felt guilty and was convinced that if I do not follow Dr. M.'s advice, I will not get pregnant. . . Today I already have a child - I managed to do so without the exhaustive treatment recommended by your doctor as without rejecting the lifestyle and dressing. Greetings"
4782,"A very large hotel located on the edge of town. The huge number of hotel guests makes you feel like you are at a hotel station. Poor quality of hotel rooms to price, poor food. Poor service. Generally not recommended."
4783,"The scientists also conducted tests on a mouse model of herpes, reflecting the course of herpes in humans. Histological tests on tissue fragments taken as a result of these tests showed a significant decrease in the number and size of HSV - 2 infection outbreaks, which confirmed their antiviral effect. In turn, a team of scientists from the Medical University of Gdańsk, headed by prof . Jolanta Myśliwska carried out research on the causes of adverse vascular changes in adolescent type 1 diabetes. This diabetes in 80 - 90% of cases affects children and adolescents, mainly between 12 and 15 years of age. It is an autoimmune disease leading to the slow destruction of beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin and the loss of the ability to secret it. According to a WHO study, in 2000 there were 171 million people with all forms of diabetes in the world, and by 2030 there will be 366 million people with type 1 diabetes, with the number of people with type 1 diabetes increasing 2.3 times over the same period."
4784,"Good news for hoteliers: there are market niches on the accommodation market where the supply does not keep up with demand. Bad news for investors: this is happening in the United States, or at least not yet in Poland. What niche is it about? The hotels at airports. According to the data of STR, the use of rooms in hotels at airports is 10.9% higher than the market average use of rooms in the United States. In 2013 it amounted to 71.7%. This was 62.4% compared to 62.4% in 2010. At that time, the average price of a day's hotel stay in arrival hotels increased from 89 to 102 dollars. According to the data quoted by STR, this is because passenger air traffic is growing rapidly and the number of hotels operating at airports is growing only slightly. While in 2010 STR added 2,254 such hotels, there are currently only 43 more."

The most common childhood cancers in Poland are hematopoietic system cancers - leukemia. They constitute about . 26% of all childhood cancers . ""Symptoms of haematological diseases are non-specific, they may resemble infections (e.g. fever, sweat - especially at night, weakness), but also one of the symptoms of haematological diseases, resulting from immunological disorders, may be recurrent infections.

4786,"We're going to Krakow, not far away but it's always a weekend away. 5 * the hotel welcomes us at the entrance of the former Krak motel, on the way parking for TIR - that and finally there is a beautiful driveway, spacious lobby, nice and helpful staff. We get as a family two connected rooms (301 and 303). Inside the microcosm that is all micro. Tiny two bathrooms, a toilet squeezed in between the shower and the sink, sitting on the toilet seat you have to approach the loading: ) . Beds are uncomfortable, as if sunken on one side. Koldra thin, cold at night, and up to the wife's side. Dinner at the restaurant without revelation, service is terrible, two drinks and delivery time is 2 times 45 minutes. Morning breakfast against fears and opinions quite decent. No only coffee cups and tables slightly out of date. Food OK. And then check out, the lady instead of asking about the mini-bar, she calls the ladies' room by the client asking about the state of the room. In summary, some 3, 5 * , never, never 5 *"

Nice, unsympathetic, PYSKATIC, PYSKATIC, back the repulsive lady repsonist I don't know if she will write the name Irnija (with APATOM ONE) well on the second day of our stay went down to the reception desk to ask if they have adhesive tape because they wanted us to shop an envelope with a postcard. To which you replied ""THE SHOP IS ON THE HEAD and I ask you to ask them to ask them to the SELLER"" we were in great shock when we heard what she said because she didn't expect such an answer. I can't believe that a person with this approach to a client works at the reception desk. They should encourage guests, not breathe. Other people who were standing next to us also did not believe what they heard. Very but it is a very weak entertainment programme, nothing for children. The cleaning staff is very nice to go without the knowledge of English. Especially the ladies from Block E. Thank you. Eating monotonous every day the same, poor choice, it would seem that we are at the ocean so fish and seafood should be everyday life. Not here, maybe once a week. It's a shame there's no traditional Spanish food. As for the facility is pure care, nothing bad can be said. Only because of this loathing woman at the reception desk I don't recommend this place."
4788,"I got into the hands of this rehabilitant when no one else could ""deal with me"". Mr. Sebastian started to work out the causes of the pain, patiently and consistently worked on my cases by hand, after just a few treatments, she knew that she had found me in the hands of a good physiotherapist. His treatments are always effective, they give relief in suffering, and most importantly, he takes a comprehensive approach to the pain and suffering of patients. Additionally, full of empathy, kind with a sense of humor, very responsible. I recommend to everyone and as a recommendation let's use the fact that to another physiotherapist I will not go."
4789,"Course : Mathematical analysis and lecture and exercises And I do not recommend . Yes, I do. I didn't like it. And she had Analysis I with him. I guess you can pass and all, but no. . . Maybe this reluctance is also caused by the fact that she did not pass me in colloquia only at the exam (but the tasks were easy) . But I didn't want to go to the lectures at all, I didn't get his words, somehow she couldn't listen to him. I was only laughing at his saving - every piece of paper he could use: ) And it was his """

4792,"National consultant in haematology prof . Wiesław W . Jędrzejczak told PAP that the morphology of peripheral blood should be included in periodic examinations performed in occupational medicine. ""Since 1996 it has no longer been obligatory for all employees, which is a pity as it would allow many people to detect serious diseases such as leukaemia earlier"" - he stressed . ""The occupational doctor may order a blood test, but only for workers exposed to harmful agents in the workplace,"" said the national occupational health consultant on the medicine. Paweł Wdowik . He added that for the time being, only some companies are voluntarily including morphology in the medical package to increase their competition on the labour market."
4793,"The hotel is from a previous era. Especially the bathroom and the toilet are definitely behind us. The service is nice and helpful, although no room upgrade due to Platinum status. The room insert associated with the status is 2 micro - fruit mousses in glasses - it is probably better to give nothing more than that. Breakfast is very, very basic, consisting of low quality products and poorly served, e.g. yellow cheese dried on the edges. I don't think I'll stop there anymore. . ."

Our son has a very warm contact with his ""Auntie of rehabilitation"". although he can be a troublesome patient sometimes: ) Mrs. Joasia willingly shares her knowledge, she is interested in the effects of Jaś's visits to specialists. It was she who recommended us to consult with the logopedist. She is an open-minded man who approaches the therapy as a whole, not forgetting about support for parents as well."
4795,"Last year she was supposed to give birth to me in Salve at the NFZ did all the research for ok. 200 zloty and everything was going to be ok . Unfortunately, when the last gynecological visit took place, where the date of delivery was expected to be in 4 days, the doctor gave me such gynecological examinations, which I will not forget for the rest of my life. He twisted me inside, it hurt so terribly that it hissed with pain. What the doctor said that everything is fine and I have to call in a couple of days when I'm due. She called me anyway, but after 5 hours from the examination because the contractions started. My doctor from the clinic because I had to go to her after the referral to the hospital said that I am starting to give birth and I have to go to the hospital immediately. When she called me at Salve they said that there were no places and she gave birth to me in Madurowicz. She talked to another doctor about this situation, all the more so as there was no indication from the tests for an earlier birth that Dr. Salve was in Madurowicz. Wiliński gave me a premature birth. I leave it up to other patients."
4796,"When he saw 'em at first, he was delighted with 'em. Good microphone, nice package, nice look of the headphones. Generally speaking, the BEST was very pleased with 'em. Somewhere after 3 months the problems with the microphone started once it worked once it didn't work, after 6 months it didn't detach it because then it didn't work for a long time and didn't want to tempt them hoping for another miracle that when you plug it in it will work again. After 3 / 4 years one side sat down completely. . . . It had already completely killed me and changed 'em to akg 514 and what . . . ? A huge difference in quality and you had to pay a little extra. And on the new headphones you can hear much better in fps at what level the opponent is at the back of the fatality could not distinguish between 'em. As long as he turned 'em around and checked 'em usually dead. I don't recommend in the long run for 3 months may be okay but for this purchase for a while. Hopeless design , microphone cable and generally whole headphones ."
4797,"I got to your doctor after two weeks of a terrible cough, at first it lasted for a while, with time it was getting stronger and longer. In addition, for three days she had a fever of up to 40 degrees, which she couldn't break down, and dyspnea started to appear. During the visit the doctor made an impression as if he didn't listen to me at all, he kept tapping the keys and didn't even look at me. He was only interested in my eyes, which were bloodied (I have it always when I have something ailing or when I am just tired). She tried to explain to you that she didn't come here with my eyes and my problem is the cough that doesn't let me fall asleep anymore or function normally, but it didn't work. She got m pills for her allergy and was ordered to take nurofen in case of fever. She asked me for a cough medicine but the Doctor just looked at me eloquently and got up inviting another patient. I will add that it was a private visit. After four days, I was hospitalized with acute massive bilateral pneumonia, the doctors were terrified of my case and asked why she hadn't seen a doctor before. . . After two weeks of hospitalization, antibiotics, steroids for dyspnea, inhalation and lying under oxygen started to improve. Luckily, she found me very good specialists in the hospital. I do not recommend your doctor to anyone."
4799,"The recreation center Odysseus visited the city on New Year's Eve. She didn't set her mind on too much so I don't feel disappointed. The contact with the staff of the facility is at least strange - extremely incompetent and spraying . Only in contact with the facility manager did we manage to establish something. The location is fantastic - right by the lake with an exceptional view from the window. Rooms in cottages of medium standard, enough for sleeping at night. However, the facility is described as a ""Hotel"" and from my point of view it does not meet the hotel conditions. Buffet breakfast in a very basic version. Not for the picky ones. Whereas lunches are fantastic, delicious and portions satisfactory for men. The staff is very praised by Mr. Parkingman - an exceptionally nice and helpful man. The stay is quite nice and the object for people with little exaggerated expectations."
4800,"Hello. Dr. Elizabeth Bednarczyk is a wonderful doctor. Nice, nice and caring for her patients: ) Such a doctor could not have imagined in my best dreams. The doctor performed a laparoscopic gallbladder removal procedure on me. Before the procedure, I was informed exactly how such a procedure will look like and what I can expect from the procedure. I highly recommend such a professional surgeon : ) I greet everyone with stones in the gallbladder - don't worry Dr. Elżbieta Bednarczyk will take care of you (i.e. will perform the operation) in the best possible and safe way: )"
4802,"With the history of my injuries, deep, hard to bear trauma, having roots in childhood, and then only developing, because up to adulthood, unaware, not overworked, as a result, only piling up, up to the onset of disease - in every man I see a potential, if not an abuser, an enemy, then certainly a man who will not understand me, ridicule, humiliate, criticize. After the second visit to Mr. Martin, I begin to feel a little safer, I gain trust, I begin to see as a doctor and a man who wants to help me, respects me, despite my ailments. The doctor allows the patient to adjust the course of the visit to his predisposition. At the same time, he is specific, controls the course of the visit, but does not exert pressure. He is able to indicate the wrong course of thinking, he is also able to show when the patient thinks completely correctly. My impressions are very positive, although I find it difficult to put them into words. What I miss is a longer conversation, but as a patient with a long history, I realize that a psychiatrist deals with the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of a specific disease or ailment. That's why I also signed up for behavioural psychotherapy in order to control my anxiety. Mr. Marcin has chosen my medicine well, he listens to the patient's comments. I do not think he treats the patient as ""crazy"". After the first visit I had a little bit worse choice of medication, but also my condition and the task to be done was completely different. I have a negative experience with drugs, I react badly to them (I have a widespread allergy). This time the medication works well on me and I hope that after a longer period of use, its effect will not change for the worse. Although, as usual, I am concerned that the leaflet warns me not to stop taking the medication suddenly and without medical supervision. It means, however, that there are no drugs that are not addictive (perhaps it is more about the risk of the return of symptoms of the disease from the so-called ""rebound"") and which are safe. I hope that after undertaking the therapy, I will be able to gradually reduce the doses and somehow try to cope with life without pharmacology. . ."
4804,"The iron fits my needs, but I have a few objections. First of all, it's too big, although I understand where it comes from and it's not really possible to pick on it. Secondly, when ironing, the cord heats up and touching it I feel discomfort, but it is not so hot as to get burned. The advantage is more. The iron iron irons all clothes at the same temperature (there is no need to change the temperature). Leaving the foot of the iron on the fabric is practically impossible to burn. It irons quickly, the foot gives out as much steam as it needs to iron even the most resistant fabrics."
4805,"Hello, we were at Costa Tropical at the end of August. Hotel worth recommending, super weather, animation and animator Saimon very nice to children and adults. The food is varied but monotonous. Cleanliness in the center and in the rooms really very good. The hotel has shops as well as a beauty and hairdressing salon. KU to my surprise run by the polka Natalie , whose services I have used several times and I have always been pleased. I used a hairdressing service with my husband and I recommend a very specific hairdresser and most importantly, she cuts very well."
4807,"I was at that lady's house and unfortunately it wasn't a nice visit. Very unpleasant midwife, she did me a favor that she ""pressed"" me in line - and she had an appointment 2 weeks in advance. ! ! ! I do not recommend especially for girls who are experiencing their first visit to the gynaecologist!"
4809,"My visit was very short and unfortunately it did not end as expected. She came to me with the problem of a stopped eight, which caused great pain. Encouraged by opinions from this side, among others, she was sure that I would receive professional help that day. Unfortunately. The time of the visit was accelerated, she was chasing me straight from work throughout Wroclaw and the visit consisted only of reviewing and writing a prescription 'in case of further ailments'. In addition, everything in a big hurry, which could be felt. More consultations than activities during the visit . Fortunately, today I am already after pulling out the eights at another doctor - on the first visit the worst of the eights was happily removed and immediately afterwards another one. Despite everything, I make a neutral comment because the doctor is a nice person and probably such cases as mine do not happen often. However, let's require from doctors more attention, time and professional help, because we pay for it ; - ) Greetings."

4811,"I highly recommend Dr. Włodarczyk! Mr. Adam got 'em thanks to "" a well-known doctor pe el . "" Before the first visit was em like my nightmare of your dreams . Now there is hope for a return to the life of a king of gold . I'm still in the process of treating anxiety neurosis, but I'm already feeling better. Mr. Wlodarczyk eliminated from my bloodstream the drugs of his predecessor ( escile ) and convinced me to a beautiful drug called sertagen . In the beginning I was 'em negative about these pills because of the big inscription in the PSYCHOTROPOWE leaflet. . . Unlike the other ""doctors"" and doctors, Mr. Włodarczyk explained to me in detail the effect of the drug on neurotransmitters. He dispelled all the doubts raised by the leaflet of the drug, answering all my questions. A visit to Mr. Adam is not only a treatment, but also a medical and biological lesson. A man swallows tablets in a completely different way, if he knows their exact mechanism of action. Thanks to Mr. Włodarczyk, I no longer feel any fears every time: I can safely slide down the slide in the ""aquaswer"". ...even with a cannibal shark under his arm. Earlier (on a nervous background and on other medications) I thought I had a heart attack when I was 'em on the first corner of the fourth drain pipe. I check my pulse much less often, because I feel alive. Thoughts don't break down my sudden fear so much anymore. I can do household chores like laundry vacuuming. Anxiety attacks are less frightening to me anymore. When I get closer to the sertagen, I slowly manage to move away from the aphramid and everything is on its way to freedom from seizure anxiety. Working out of the house makes it impossible for me to be constantly afraid of a seizure, but I think that after jumping on 250 sertagen I will live a normal life again and everything will pass. . . Mr. Włodarczyk is able to choose the right medication, he knows perfectly well the quality and the effects of using it in other patients. As the only doctor I have met, he answers the text messages and advises what to do, what to do to make it better. . . With Mr. Włodraczek you can speak calmly. Stress-free tell your stories and tell all the things and reasons for your health. Thank you, Doctor, for your patience and greetings. Probably, if m used sertagen right away as it should be, it would be m already at 100 % more turnover than a washing machine with head washed out of all fears . visit 6 / 6 patience 6 / 6 contact with the patient 6 / 6 engagement 6 / 6 effects 6 / 6"
4812,"I have mixed feelings about your visit to the doctor. It was my first time with this lady, although it wasn't my first time with a gynaecologist. She wanted me to have a check-up, I know I have ectopia but the doctor didn't comment at all during the check-up. The examination went very quickly and I understand that, but her statements were rather laconic. What surprised me the most was that she refused the breast examination. She had already been to many doctors and no gynaecologist refused me. Some people have it included in the price, others have it for a fee. During a gynaecological visit I always ask for it and it seemed to me that nowadays it is standard. All the more so because there is so much talk about it. I was only talking about prevention, and the doctor sent me to a radiologist! Out of curiosity, she called me later to 5 other gynaecological offices asking if the patient's breasts are examined at the patient's request - in each office they confirmed that they do. Explanations of the doctor and explaining why she does not perform such examinations were very vague. I don't think I will come back here."
4813,"Location great, everywhere close, nice service, price ok, clean and at that end the advantages of this place. Breakfast is a mockery! There is a screen at the reception for breakfast and this is a makeshift kitchen. Coffee, microwave tea, toasted bread and jam. . . . .if you don't buy something yourself, you'll go hungry. There's not even a place to sit down, you have to take ""breakfast"" to a room where there are no conditions to eat anyway. The bed is terribly uncomfortable. We had to take the mattress down to the floor to get some sleep as well. There is no air-conditioning in the hotel - which for me is not a necessary condition - on hot days you had to open a window, but as it turned out, the hotel is above the restaurant and all very intense food smells land in the room. No parking space. In conclusion, I do not recommend!"
4816,"I was at Mrs. Ursula's for one visit and after that she did not decide to meet me again. Perhaps Mrs. Ursula helped others, I had the impression that she met a completely different person than the one from the portal. The only advantage of the meeting was that Mrs. Urszula was all the time focused on talking to me and not, as other people claim, on Internet browsing or beauty treatments."
4817,"If by any chance they'd like to go to that woman's ""specialist"", I strongly advise against it. She just came back from her private office. I don't trust her as a doctor enough to go to another gynaecologist tomorrow to compare opinions. She decided that I have a great erosion, although a month ago she heard from another doctor that you should only do a cytology every six months because she has not yet given birth to me so it cannot be removed. She said that I can have cancer if I don't go to the treatment she does for 200 PLN (about 3 such treatments are needed) - it is a liquid treatment - as she read a moment ago on the medical forum of the doctor that the treatment is not very effective. As if it wasn't enough at the last minute she remembered that she has to write me a prescription. Besides, she wrote me a birth control pill for women in their 40s. I don't recommend it, I advise against it anywhere but there. A woman is unpleasant, not very empathic, unable to make conversation and relieve stress caused by the visit. She took 180 zloty from me - honestly she has no idea what for. . . . .I'm still not sure what's wrong with me. And I am frankly afraid to use the pills she prescribed. No no no and again no! ! !"

Pool! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! in the description and pictures a new, beautiful, modern! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! In fact, a swimming pool with dirty water and ice, how can it not be used because of dirty water and ice! ! ! ! Unfortunately, there were more attractions. Christmas Eve beautifully organized, lasted about 2 hours. However, it was a time designated for thieves or hotel staff. All the staff at the hotel had a card to the door and the cleaning ladies entered the rooms whenever they wanted under the pretext of throwing away the garbage from the bathroom bin, because nothing else was cleaned! ! ! To sum up: on Christmas Eve a beautiful evening 4 rooms were robbed. Some of the money was stolen from my wallet, a cell phone from another one, a gold bracelet from another one and 200 PLN from another one. It's probably not a coincidence that the hotel has no surveillance even 1 camera? ? ? ? ? ? A hotel where you can spend a super holiday, an unforgettable Christmas Eve and the first day of the world with the police to report a theft. Stay for me mega stressful and very expensive, because for that amount of money that cost me in this hotel, she could spend me peacefully at the Hotel Gołębiewski . The hotel has it, however, in d . . . . . and he thinks that nothing has happened. I advise against staying because for the owner of the hotel counts only foreigners as guests! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"

Also a cool place for kids, a playroom for kids and a great neighborhood, lots of attractions such as a toboggan run, a fairy-tale hut, lego brick exhibitions, various museums and much more.on the boardwalk worth recommending cafe with such nice service that you want to come back. place worth visiting and not to read negative comments : ) hello"

4822,"We've been with my husband five times in the Accessory. We went there in the autumn-winter period. The service is professional, helpful, the rooms are clean, maybe a little too small. The pool with hot water and attractions encourages you to use it. The biggest plus the hotel can get for the quantity, quality and variety of food. All meals are served in the form of a Swedish buffet, until it is difficult to taste each of the dishes (especially the wide range of cold cuts). All this is not to be missed. To the sea close, the church behind the fence. It's really worth going, although currently the prices are quite exorbitant and no promotion for short weekend trips."
4823,"To be honest, I don't even know what grade to give. . . . .but I think it'll be neutral. . . I don't know what your doctor's examination looks like because every time he was doing his rounds in the hospital, he would bump into the room for 5 seconds asking how we feel and jump out of the room before one of us could answer. She had the ""pleasure"" of meeting him in the pregnancy pathology ward and later in the maternity ward. After the birth, I was not even examined to see if everything was ok and the wound was healing as it should. Do I recommend? As a doctor in the hospital on the rounds, absolutely NO !"
4824,"The AP was to serve as a repeater to increase network coverage in a one-storey detached house. Unfortunately, it was not able to work with the WPA2 protected network based on TP - W8901 link, because it simply does not support WPA2 in repeater mode, nor the client (I do not know as in others). Of course, on its website the manufacturer claims that WPA2 is supported. . . Since I do not have access to the modem configuration, I decided to work around the problem by creating a new network with my old Linux WRT54G2 and strengthening it with the discussed WA - 500g . Unfortunately, WA - 500g turned out not to work with any security enabled, i.e. outdated WEP (WPA cannot be activated at all, but em already wrote about it). With the protections switched off in the repeater mode, everything is working as well as possible. Any configuration error I exclude, because I checked em all several times, using a few keys - it did not work on any of them, while natychmikast after turning off the protections everything returns to normal. I am not interested in leaving the network unprotected or playing with MAC filtering. Of course the firmware has updated me to the latest version. It is also worth noting that any unofficial software is not available for the following device. In my case, the device is only suitable for throwing away."
4825,"The Christmas accident was a great success. The hotel, although with a base of more than 100 rooms, allows you to rest and relax your body and mind. The service is very helpful and polite. It treats its customers as household members. The rooms are clean, well-kept and well-equipped, just like the bathroom. Breakfast at a surcharge of 20 zł satisfactory and tasty, varied choice. Traditional cuisine, no fad. I recommend especially pasta. Although located close to the tracks, you could not really hear the trains passing by. 5 minutes by car to Torun. A small swimming pool with an artificial current and a Jacuzzi allowed you to properly relax. The only thing that stood out from the rest was the quality of the pool tables. Undereduced made playing difficult. To sum up, the object is a great plus. I sincerely recommend!"
4826,"I admit that Mrs. Ewelina is an empathic person. However, after consultation with 3 psychologists, I can say that I was not fully diagnosed despite 2 years of therapy. One of the most troublesome ""ailments"" in my life was omitted. Mrs. Ewelina couldn't help me to find appropriate methods to deal with my fears. Despite a very long therapy, it was not better and still worse. There is no way to improve my mental state. She is conducting psychological therapy in the psychodynamic current and has ensured that it is appropriate in my case. Unfortunately it wasn't, which resulted in deepening my anxiety despite a very long therapy. My person was not directed to any ""ways"". how to deal with them, how to reduce them. Instead of getting reliable help they were given the possibility of long monologues and not getting help as they try to deal with their fears. Now, after consultation with therapists who are conducting therapy in the behavioural cognitive, humanistic or integrative stream, I know that this stream was completely misguided. In addition, psychotherapists were shaking their heads when they found out that with my anxiety disorders the current was chosen. Quoting: ""This is not an effective method in your case."" ""I wouldn't recommend this trend."" Unfortunately, he trusted me unnecessarily with a therapist. I have a lesson. Now I know that in any matter related to our health you have to consult at least two specialists, because you may find that we are treated unsuccessfully (as in my case) . I give 2 stars, because many people are surely able to help, unfortunately, this lady was not me. Fortunately, when I meet a reasonable, knowledgeable therapist, I feel better and better from visit to visit. In turn, attending the therapy to this lady from month to month instead of better or worse, or at least similarly, it was getting worse and worse. However, I believe that she had good intentions and wanted to help me and that is why I give two stars."
4830,"A grazing hotel, as they say: ) A super pool and sauna area, they take care of the cleanliness and details. The rooms are large, spacious, warm and comfortable. Breakfast - the best that I have eaten in hotels. Impressive and the choice and quality and choice of dishes. A small minus for the night cave - bar in the basement. The decor and climate of a typical burd. . . . .sorry : . . excuse me :) building materials . The bartender could practice the classic drinks . Generally - great . . ."
4831,"A great orthopedist. After 2 years of problems with the shoulder, I was recommended to Dr . Szarzyński . The doctor immediately approached the issue by ordering an MRI. The MRI showed minor problems with SLAP joint dressing. Dr. Szarzyński recommended an arthroscope during which either the joint is stable enough and the ring is holding that it can be rehabilitated or 2 anchors will have to be inserted. Unfortunately, I have finished with the anchors in the pond. After the surgery I always had the opportunity to contact my doctor. Initially, em appeared quite often (according to the recommendations) and even though there was no record (in the medicover) em was always taken. Now, more than 3 years after the injury and a year after the surgery, I can in good conscience recommend Dr . Szarzyński . He is a kind and meticulous doctor, who has done a miracle for me and enabled me to return to sport."
4833,"Mr. Grzegorz searched the internet for me, suggesting the opinions that he had gained in his patients. During the first visit I was surprised by the approach to the patient, thorough analysis, accuracy - 100% professionalism of course. I am very satisfied with the diagnosis and the indications that m . The exercises that Mr. Grzegorz gave me helped me a lot, although she thought that nothing can help me with my spine ailments. Although I am from Oświęcim, despite the distance, she decides to pay a visit because it is really worth to come and use the help of one of the best physiotherapists in Poland. Mr. Grzegorz answers my emails and explains my doubts. Thanks to Mr. Grzegorz she believed that there are no impossible things I am very grateful to him for helping me regain my health. With a pure heart I recommend Mr. Grzegorz to every person who has already lost hope of recovery. I greet Mirosław from Oświęcim."
4834,"The Hotel Globales Amrecia turned out to be a shot at 10 : D I really recommend this hotel ! ! ! away from the center an hour drive from the airport. Quiet and quiet, beautiful views! The only thing you can pick up on is sitting down boring all the time. A little too little attraction for the children. But very close to the beach! Very clean and renovated hotel. I really recommend it. If someone is looking for more attractions for children, please rather choose hotels typical for children. There is a playground and a paddling pool. However, a little lack of swings. But the kids have radoche in the sand and bathing in the sea, so there was no major problem here! super organized Tui tours ; ) I recommend it !"
4836,"He wanted me to express here in the forum my greatest admiration for this doctor and my respect for the fact that he is a man. Unluckily, I had a very serious accident about two months ago with a very complicated fracture of both forearm bones. I was in danger of losing a certain fitness of my hand. Hands are my tool for my work, they are necessary for my profession in any form. Before the operation I often had to think about it - will I have to retrain? Have 15 years of hard learning and work been in vain? Well, it turned out not. I am a doctor myself and I know what it means to feel in my heart that a case is just difficult. I know this responsibility. The highest responsibility for my health was shown by Dr. Zimmer. Today is seven weeks after the surgery, I go to rehabilitation but. . . ... I have practically no complaints, I work as before the accident, I help at home with housework and it is just a simple shock! This doctor has made the black day of life just a nightmare and my future and my family's future has taken colour again."
4837,"There's no point in taking the kids there if you're not going to answer questions like ""why does this rabbit have a latex suit"" or ""what is this whip on the wall for?"" . A funny hotel. He's got some kind of decoration idea. I just hope the sheets are washing after every customer. ( I won't give a damn about that. ) Breakfast is medium, but still everyone is looking at the handcuffs on the wall hanging: ) . Pink curtains . Just such an erotic cliché. Not dangerous, not yet unsavoury, but also without some special hello. Limit 2 * and 3 * ."
4838,"A hotel on the sidelines on the main road. At the check-in we were sent to the building next door, the room was on the 5th floor with windows from the street where it was constantly blowing and you could hear the noise from the street all the time. The room was rated on average. The hotel, on the other hand, where we ate breakfast (only for the first 3 days) is tragic in terms of organization and equipment, the time has remained there in the 80s. The old equipment, equipment, computers did not work. In the hotel, pensioners themselves, no young people. I am not picky but the breakfasts were a disaster: scrambled eggs with powder that could not be eaten, beans, bacon, sliced minced meat and yellow cheese I do not know why diced and not sliced? Egg planted and as hard as the only option to eat something. The hotel is a place where breakfast is served that requires cleaning and refreshing the equipment (dirty dishes, toaster until it sticks to the dirt), the hotel smells unpleasant. The swimming pool wasn't even used by us, but the view of deckchairs and their condition was enough. This hotel was the worst in which I had the pleasure of staying. Massacre"
4839,"The hotel recommended me two friends on the basis of a visit to the Manor Hotel a few years ago. Unfortunately, at the moment the hotel presents a terrifying level. We were on a long May weekend. The hotel has a habit of charging for the entire stay in advance. As if what we have to see in the room was to deter us from further stay . The room was dark and needed airing. Ventilation was hampered by the fact that the balcony door (to the common terrace for several other rooms cannot be tilted vertically. There used to be such a possibility, but at least a dozen or so years old window woodwork is already heavily covered. Leaving the balcony completely open seemed too risky to me). After reaching the balcony, my head collected a cobweb. For lunch and dinner, the choice is very small (1 type of meat, 1 type of fish, mashed potatoes, one raw and the end). There is more variety in the canteens of office buildings. But you have to admit that the food was decent. Theoretically, the insults in the case of breakfasts served up to 10 : 30 already at 10 : 00 started everything (from the food starting with the dishes to the drinks ending). The service is oriented towards conformation with guests rather than helping them. The picture is completed by the fact that in the morning the bathroom (whose cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired) lacked hot water to take a shower. I don't go to Hotel Manor anymore and advise others against it."
4840,"I recommend and disagree with the previous opinion. I lay a week in a hospital in Lviv and I could see that this doctor treats patients extremely well regardless of age and wealth. In my opinion he cares about the health of the patients as best as possible by visiting them and this not only on their heads in the morning and in the evening, but also carefully monitors their health. In my opinion a very good surgeon doing his heart work, caring for patients and requiring commitment to the hospital staff."
4842,"It's very nice to play. Mainly because of the beautifully reproduced Mediterranean film. The soundtrack straight from the movie makes you smile. A lot of characters that can be controlled. The number of tasks and collectors of all kinds of things should satisfy most. The light humor of the series is maintained, and playing with your colleagues in cooperation is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the plot is limited to the first 2 parts of the film (they should do the game after all three parts of the film) . Dwarves sometimes hard to distinguish, a little bit of them is . Occasionally there is confusion, chaos on the screen."
4843,"Hi. We're just after seeing you, Dr. Bishop. and I can recommend him with a clean heart. My 7-month-old daughter started to have a fever on Friday, on Saturday we went on duty to the hospital in Olkusz, where after examination by the doctor on duty it turned out that the little one has an ear infection, the doctor prescribed an antibiotic and after that. However, something was not giving me any peace of mind and we went to see Dr. Sir. The diagnosis was different from the previous one and he said that the little one had a three-day booklet (he was not afraid to write it in the health booklet, unlike the first doctor). We trusted his diagnosis and in fact it turned out that the little girl had a three-day girl (the fever disappeared after three days and pustules appeared on her chest). However, starting from the doctor she had mixed feelings, because he is quite a grim man, but in total he is supposed to treat and not entertain the child. We personally recommend ."
4844,"She treated me when she was younger - I advise against it because I went to her for a long time, she had a lot of visits, still antibiotics (8 antibiotics treatments a year) almost did not show up at school, the third tonsil was cut out, but really ""cut out"" because he practically grew up and then my mother would have dragged me to her if it wasn't for the district doctor, who did everything right. But every laryngologist treats differently - there are probably people for whom the doctor has carried out the right treatments."
4845,"Not a very aesthetic room with too soft a bed. Destroyed furniture, walls requiring painting. Poor bathroom with cracks in the ceiling, a strange raid on the shower and a hopeless placement of faucets in the shower. Eating OK, but monotonous. Coffee is not good. On the plus side: very efficient and fast service in the restaurant."
4846,"The furniture is designed in modern shapes and natural shades of beige and grey, with energizing and illuminating orange accents. ""We wanted to modernize the decoration to bring out the attractive space of the high lobby. The rooms are made in a fashionable style maintained in light tones with the addition of interesting color accents. We used modern finishing materials and a well thought-out lighting system for this purpose. By introducing soft forms and designer equipment, we tried not to give up the good atmosphere and at the same time keep the interior cosy"". says Agnieszka Kowalska, architect from the Tremend design office. Novotel Krakow City West Hotel Novotel Krakow City West , in the first half of this year will surprise its guests with a completely new design of the lobby, reception and bar. The arrangement of public areas will change their colours and lighting, giving them a modern style with warm accents of yellow and orange."
4847,"The weekend in this place is one of the worst events that has ever happened to me when it comes to having a good time. The only positive thing is that the ""manor house"" is located on the sidelines in a quiet place. Even though the prices are very high, you have to pay for everything that is there. Including saunas additionally paid 70zł, tennis court etc . The salt cave has nothing to do with the caves that can be found in other SPAs. Jacuzzi dirty and not working (people from the reception: yes we know) . In the offer they have information about the possibility of renting bikes - there is no chance they are broken and in addition someone took the key where they are stored. You have to beg for a 2-hour extension of the day on Sundays and at the end you will hear that the director of the hotel agreed but only on condition that you pay as for a normal day. If you are counting on at least half of the food in the restaurant (as indicated by the high prices), forget it too. In general, the place has nothing to do with SPA. . . . .as an overnight stay, yes, but not for that price."
4848,I'm very disappointed. I had an appointment at 13 : 15 and I was accepted at 14 : 30 because P . Eve had to go out on the town and get something done. She was in the office for less than 10 minutes. ( examination + ultrasound ) and P . Puchała deleted 200 PLN (she did not receive a receipt or any payment confirmation!) . She must have told me herself about her first pregnancy which was in danger and all my other health problems because P . Ewa did not ask me about anything. She wanted to get me to take another patient as soon as possible because she was late. Of course I won't go back there anymore! ! ! I don't recommend
4849,"I had to spend two nights in that hotel. The rooms are generally fortified, the floors have recently been cleaned. . . . .no, they weren't cleaned. You can see the old stains, some shit, etc. In the bathroom like this, the shower smells of urine, there is not even a toilet cube in the shell. There are marks of dirty hands on the walls. . . With wi - fi there is nothing to dream about watching something on Youtube. . . Breakfast? It's some mockery, a few pieces of seafood cheese, cheap hams, some eggs and some extras. No more of this hotel!"
4850,"I don't recommend it. He was with his son (14 years old) at your doctor's, he quickly needed a diagnosis when his son's kneecap jumped out for the second time (he plays professional football). Despite an appointment for a private visit for a particular hour, I waited over an hour to enter the office. The visit itself lasted 6 minutes, the doctor smiled nicely, he did not tell me anything specific (something else he did not know em after the first injury to his son). He told me to do a knee sigh (earlier the lady at the reception desk assured me that they have such a qualified staff that it is enough as the doctor will take a look and you will already know) and with the result come to the next visit will know what next. Then he will direct to himself for rehabilitation. If someone is faced with a choice to find a good orthopaedist, let him or her first of all look for a doctor who will perform on-site ultrasound examination (preferably included in the price), and I assure you that he or she will find such and such and such a good one, I was looking for 'em on the spot - and counted 'em. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the doctor and I do not recommend it to anyone."
4852,"The headphones are great. In my opinion the best choice when it comes to headphones for Xbox One - I managed to buy them for only 299 PLN . They lie perfectly on the ears and do not press your head too hard . Even during a few hours of playing I did not feel any discomfort. Additionally, they are made of very nice to the touch ecological skin. The sound quality cannot get attached to it, it looks perfect in games. The microphone is a real firecracker, I tested it in several titles and always my voice came to my companions clean, clear and without any interference or other crackling. Of course, an adapter has been attached to the headphones, which allows you to control the volume or mute the microphone while using the headphones on the console. A small minus for the lack of volume control on the headset cable - which makes it slightly difficult to use the headphones on the computer - although they work perfectly there too."
4854,"Offer for a couple - the lady from the reception desk will not inform about the possibilities of the offer that the hotel offers in the package. In order to be able to go by carriage the lady from the reception made me to make an appointment for a ride (attraction from the package) I do not know if the hotel knows what it means to say, the front to the customer ' ' due to the rain did not come to the trip. . . . .lack of organization, and the money went. . . . . . .it's a shame because our goal was to have a nice time together. . . I also advise you to work on the reality of the photos of the rooms with the reality I recommend to all visitors to buy portions because the dinner is minimalistic. I also advise you to take blankets because you can get cold (unless that's what the package is about)."
4857,"Although we've only been with you for one day, we felt good because of the warm, nice character of the hotel - you're family. The service was exemplary. Since we were in a family group with three children, the ""swimming pool"" part (rainy day) was of particular interest - everyone had a great time. The dining room deserves praise too - beautiful ambiente. The buffet was abundantly stocked. What more do you want? Hotel worth recommending ."
4858,"She was with Mr. Blachowicz and I am very disappointed. I had a bad result - TSH (standard is 0, 5 - 2, 5) and I had my hair much higher than 3, 9 the reason for the visit was a handful of hair falling out. The doctor did not find anything disturbing, let alone suspicious of the thyroid gland, because it is unlikely (in her opinion). She was not able to directly state the cause of weakening of hair condition. I, on the other hand, asked me by force to suggest other tests, which may state this. She said that she assumed ""in advance"" that everything is ok and that she is probably panicking, but since I care so much about FT4 and ANTY TPO. . To sum up, she didn't know more when she left the office than when she entered it, adding that 150 PLN less in her wallet. She did these tests, went to another doctor and on the basis of TSH results another endocrinologist stated that the cause is in the thyroid gland, she got the right hormone and the condition of the hair has improved significantly - after 3 weeks I can say that it falls out less. I definitely do not recommend visiting Mrs. Blachowicz, why? 1 . the appointment is very short 7 - 10 min 2 . the interview with the patient is not conducted 3 . the doctor does not examine the patient and gives very brief answers On a visit to another endocrinologist, with whom I am very satisfied, I was listened to, there was a blood pressure constellation, height, weight, breast examination, thyroid examination - manual examination, interview with the patient, the answers were very exhaustive and most importantly, I had the help I needed so much."
4859,"He stayed with 'em at the Hotel Manor from 16 to 27 August. He is terribly neglected . The times of his glory are gone with the death of Bolesław Chrobry. The service was gently speaking rude, rude and rude, and each task was performed at a snail's pace. The hotel is untidy, which makes it look like the Augiah's Stables. It's not difficult to find something broken (attention to the jamming lift), in the rooms the plaster flies from the walls, not to mention the ubiquitous mushroom. The hotel has potential, but it is badly managed. Definitely not recommended."
4860,"The hotel you need in a big city is just the right address. Good communication with the city, a rich breakfast, internet Wi - fi in rooms, parking for free. Do you need anything more? A modest room but everything you need is in the mines. For one person for 2, 3 nights - revelation"
4861,"We just got back from that hotel. I judge it very well, the hotel is clean, well maintained, the hotel staff is also fine. The only drawback was actually the eternally spoiled elevators, but let's not exaggerate, we didn't have to wait 15 minutes for the elevator as some people write. We had a room on the 7th floor with a sea view. I was very pleased with it, as was the cleaning of the room. Eating good, I think everyone will find something for themselves, eating a lot, you have to really make up your mind writing that monotonous, and excuse me at home you have once a month different kind of meat or soup, also there is repetitiveness. As far as deck chairs are concerned, my husband used to put his towels on the beach every morning, let's say 8:00 - 8:30, there was never a shortage of empty ones in the morning, she also didn't observe me lying on the sand, so I think it's a matter of organization. There were swimming pools by the hotels and the aquapark at the guests' disposal outside the beach, so everyone could choose something, even when we went to the aquapark in the afternoon, there were always sun loungers. We also didn't have any intestinal problems, maybe if I already had to stick to something strong it was pretty hot in the restaurant when there were meals, especially at breakfast in the morning, but that really wouldn't be a fact for which I wouldn't advise against the hotel. The animations for children in Polish are also great. Generally I think the hotel is very good, I recommend it and it was 2 years old so I pay attention to a lot of things when it comes to my child and his well-being."
4862,"The hotel has some problem with the septic tank, we were greeted by the stench in the room. The shower was water at room temperature. The cabin is broken. The carpet is stained. Furniture worn out . It is not true that there are 4 saunas available for guests. When we arrived, one works and the temperature in it is 70 degrees . Spa is an ugly basement just . The hotel has too small a restaurant. Guests are waiting for the table to be released. Eating from bemaras but beware of heaters ! ! ! . Bemaras set in the aisle . Every now and then something is missing and you have to wait for someone to report it after several minutes. The dream trip has turned into a nightmare."
4863,"The participants of the parade competition have different degrees of disability. Some of them only use wheelchairs on a daily basis, others cannot see or have one limb. There are also those whose disability is more difficult to see. Disabled athletes compete in different groups. The least able ones ride only at the tarsus; the more able ones - at the tarsus and trot; the next ones - also gallop and those whose degree of disability allows them to do so - present their side walk on horses. The history of Tomasz Zdańkowski (a young man with partial paralysis), who has been taking part in such classes for many years and additionally takes part in parade competitions, shows how hippotherapy positively influences the well-being and health of disabled people. Over the last 12 years he has changed beyond recognition. As Jadwiga Maciaszek recalls, at the beginning he moved incorrectly and had problems with writing, he was mentally separated from others. Now there is no problem with public speaking, he goes to trainings on his own and sparks energy."
4864,"I was at your doctor's for one visit, first and last. The fact is that she commissioned a lot of research, but she could have done it myself as well, and without a referral it costs ok. 500 PLN. They did not show anything, from what the doctor suggested. Throughout the whole visit she felt as if I was from the ""bush."" and my child didn't see the doctor in front of his eyes. all the suggestions that the child is ill-treated, etc... Although the young one was 4 or 5 years old and the problems started with going to kindergarten (difficult to cure cough after infections), he hadn't been ill so far. She prescribed a ton of drugs that she didn't buy me, and for my questions if diphergan 3 times a day was necessary the answer was one that suggested that the question was stupid, and I was trying to question the competence of the doctor (this is how she felt). The little one who had a little bit of a nebula in his throat earlier, the doctors treated him with bactrim, which was incomprehensible to your dock, and on the prescription she also got m bactrim. . . After this visit I felt like an irresponsible idiot, and my child stopped coughing when spring came, without this miraculous treatment. I would definitely not recommend it. I give a neutral assessment, because the treatment I can not comment, because I did not take it, but the visit itself is nothing pleasant."
4865,"What a wonderful place Regno is located centrally walking to all the attractions. The courteous staff is very eager to help. The rooms were clean and comfortable and I really enjoyed the Italian atmosphere of the whole hotel. Breakfast was good and the coffee was made freshly to order. Our room wasn't ready on the day of arrival because we had an early flight. Our luggage was guarded at the hotel while we walked around the city. . On our return they gave us a better room with a balcony, it was beautiful and with a view of the main street in front of the hotel. We were going to book through a travel agency but found them better prices when booking directly from the hotel through their website."
4866,"I'm very sorry, because I always try to praise rather than negatively evaluate the facilities where I had the pleasure of staying, but in this case it is difficult to see the positive aspect of this hotel. From the very beginning of the visit, the organization of the hotel has raised objections. . . problem with getting a pre-arranged room, preparing dinner for two people, leaving aside the child, the whole infrastructure around the hotel in ruins (rusty bikes, no bikes for children and seats, the playground is full of splinters - we were not able to use anything). ...the unpleasant smell in the room, cleanliness at a poor level. She was able to keep it all quiet and have fun, but at the time of check-out she received the information that I have to pay additional fees associated with the stay of the child - where before booking and paying for the stay emphasized the age of the child and everything agreed. The owners are not able to answer for the lack of knowledge of their employees and demand additional charges from guests, which is an absurd situation. She paid me and left me with a huge dislike and aversion to this place ."
4867,"The research methods developed by Warsaw scientists will allow for the future search for pharmaceuticals that would have a precise effect on particular neural networks responsible for fear and its suppression. This would be a significant progress in treating phobias. The substances known so far affect not individual neuronal circuits, but entire brain structures. This means that their use could lead to uncontrolled erasure of memory traces. Fear, which is a strong, reflex response of the body to a specific stimulus, plays an important evolutionary role. The animal that feels it has a better chance of surviving in an unfriendly environment. However, exaggerated fear leads to anxiety disorders, which can significantly impede the functioning of the organism."
4868,"Nice place, peace and quiet. But that's all the good news. The service is not very professional, the hotel manager knows nothing and as if he couldn't do anything, he covers himself up all the time with the owner of the hotel (of course also claiming that he is not there at the moment). Soft mattresses, the bathroom needs to be cleaned more thoroughly (mouldy joints and dirty glass), carpets also dirty. Kitchen like kitchen, super revelation is not there. Spa? It's a mockery in the jacuzzi with cold water and in the saunas only slightly warm. Generally the hotel looks like it did in the 90's and maybe it was a luxury then, now? There are nicer places and certainly with better service!"
4869,"I gotta talk to your doctor about a suspected insulin resistance. The doctor looked only at one of the many results, she said that the flat sugar curve I have is not cured and she was ready to finish the visit. Only my persistence and further description of the symptoms ""encouraged"" the doctor to look at the other results. The way I talked to the patient also leaves a lot to be desired. The ""doctor"" advises"" as if she had just chastised a few years old child. This is the approach she would expect me to take when visiting the NFZ and not in private. To sum up, she came out of the visit with the feeling that since I do not yet have diabetes, and she came to me to find out how to proceed if insulin resistance is confirmed so as not to lead to the development of diabetes (my dad is a diabetic so I may have genetic predisposition), I am not an interesting case for the doctor. I strongly advise against it! ! !"
4870,"Sorry, but people writing reviews that rate this hotel for good were probably not in a good hotel. Contexts: 1 . We arrived at 6 a.m., we got a room at 13:30 in the old building2 . For 10 days for breakfast the same: 6 kinds of eggs served as omelette, boiled or scrambled eggs3 . Animations for children at 20 and dinner start at 19 : 30 - sprint, animation quality about 0 , 5 points on a scale from 1 - 104 . Once a week you have no choice - you go to the bingo hall and they serve you food as they see fit. Before they reach you, you participate in a strange spectacle about 1,5 h5 . The children's pool works about 3 hours a day, at another time for a child to slide down the slide he has to pour water on it or ask a parent6 . The rest of the hotel guests are French from the lower culture: they don't speak English, they were arrogant, simple - and e.g. 1 day a week animations in the form of verbal jokes only in French. other animations by force something is happening . To not be - you can verify, in the same amount we were in hotels: Royal Alhambra - Turkey , Aquis Pelekas - Corfu Greece , Langham Place - Xiamen China . . . . We have never written a complaint. This was our most disappointing holiday, the hotel looks nice but has so many underdeveloped situations that annoy us. . ."
4873,"Good morning I was asked to give my opinion but the visit was not carried out as it should . First of all, I would like to stress that the ekg was not made. He insisted that I was, but the doctorate stated that this makes no sense, which is absurd because I need the ekg for my treatment records. Besides, during the visit, the doctor received phone calls every now and then, especially when performing a heart echo. The visit lasted 10 minutes not 20. It was chaotic and not factual. I didn't find out what was important to me. Since I am taking antidepressants I did not find out what and if the medicines I am taking now I can take. Because there are no drugs for arrhythmia. I spent 150zl plus the commute. It's a lot of money to me. And I'm very disappointed."
4874,I advise against it! ! ! She's been with your doctor seven times with her five-year-old daughter. She had night apnea and snored terribly. The doctor said it was an allergy. He was prescribing steroid drugs after which there was no improvement in her health but her weight changed. When she got to another doctor (the child was suffocating) it turned out that the daughter had a hearing loss and a HIGHLIGHT almond to be removed and that immediately . I DISCOURAGE IT! ! !
4875,"Hotel Zacisze encouraged us mainly because of its close location and positive opinions. There was no disappointment on the spot, on the contrary. The place is ideal for families with children - playground, swimming pool and salt cave. Additionally - a café and desserts worth recommending. Rooms are spacious and modernly furnished and guarantee good rest. A big plus for breakfast - a wide choice and the possibility to eat outdoors. If someone is looking for an intimate place with all the facilities of attractions, I recommend this hotel."
4876,"It was our second stay in this hotel. While the boarding has improved, unfortunately, there were attempts to cheat us on the type of apartment we booked. Upon arrival, we were told that there were problems with the apartment and offered 2 double rooms on two different floors. When asked what is the reason for such a change, we were told that we bought the apartment at a promotional price and that is why we get double rooms (in a lamentable condition). After showing our disapproval and protesting, the receptionist, in consultation with her superiors, after an hour, assigned us the keys to the apartment. Until now, I appreciated the Austrian order, but the current situation has significantly shaken the picture. . I judge it as an attempt to defraud, return the amount obtained from the promotion."
4877,"The hotel is very clean, small rooms, about 15mkw but for a couple it is sufficient completely, flat TV, hairdryer in the bathroom, air conditioning, in winter the room is warm in the room and the possibility of own temperature control, one small minus - no brush to clean the toilet in the rooms, very helpful and smiling staff took care of every matter, breakfast buffet, everyone will be full and very tasty, and again one small minus, sausages and scrambled eggs could be in the heaters. My overall score is very good!"
4879,"We were 25. 04 together with her husband on duty . The price is 140 PLN a day, breakfast 20 PLN / person additionally paid on request. I think it's a good option if not all people use breakfast. Breakfast is a choice of sets with a hot dish and extras in large quantities. We have been given a spacious room a la suite (folded with 2 rooms with balcony). In the bedroom there is a large, comfortable bed for married couples, really comfortable pillows, a little too thin a cushion. The bathroom was spacious, well lit, but the downside was a bathtub without a curtain. You had to be very careful when using the shower to avoid flooding the bathroom. The bedroom was a bit chilly. Plus a small fridge in the room. Very important for business travellers is the location in the centre, close to offices and institutions - on foot in a few minutes. On the 3rd floor we did not hear the city noise. Proximity to restaurants, shops, cafés, services, bus stops, also a few minutes on foot. The wind - the fi worked fine - we only used laptops. Very nice service at the reception and at breakfast. Very small car park at the back of the hotel, lockable. In front of the hotel there are many parking spaces available. For us the price / quality / location / location / service / cleaning as much as possible. We stayed earlier in an ordinary motel in Nysa without wi - fi, breakfast, or the possibility of drinking coffee in an uninteresting and loud location at a price of 120zl / day so comparing the conditions here with this motel pays off more hereThe better conditions for an additional 20zl more. We believe that this is for the moment the best accommodation at a good price, and an ideal location. We are happy to take advantage again."
4880,"Cold, repulsive interiors . Food - nothing special . Service staff sweetened as usual in such places . For each treatment there is a philosophy (reflexology, music therapy, bio-energotherapy, good humor dolls or something like that, etc.). and in fact, it's just a simple massage and mask application. It's a waste of money and time."
4881,"I was once on a visit to Mrs. Katarzyna Moreno - Szypowska. Mrs. Moreno said that I have a book example of malocclusion, which requires the removal of healthy teeth - fours and sixes. I've broken 'em down a little. I went 'em to another clinic where your orthodontist said that my occlusion should close perfectly. That's how it happened - after a few months of wearing braces, my bite closed. Mrs. Katarzyna Moreno - Szypowska is a very nice person, but she was very mistaken when she said that I would have to remove my healthy teeth. Unfortunately no one will pay me back for the visit where I got information that is not true."
4882,"I have very mixed feelings, the doctor of course she was very nice but she completely ignored what dermatologists have been telling me for years. My problem is not big, dry skin that causes clogging of the hair follicles, the doctor wrote me an Izotek for six months. It was only at home that she found out that it's an ""almost final"" drug for severe skin changes, after reading the list of side effects, she went to another dermatologist who said that there was no point in taking the pills since this is clearly my genetics. He bet on exfoliating creams."
4883,I bought my mom a visit and she's very disappointed. Mrs. Agatha is nice. She gave a few tips but did not give a referral to any cardiac examination claiming that the first visit will not give until the next. The visit cost 150 zloty for a conversation which did not bring anything new. This is probably far too much. I do not recommend it. The place of visit in Poznań at Wichrowa Street .
4884,"The hotel found me thanks to a board set up in the gate. The lady at the reception turned out to be very nice, but the invoice she ordered me was not ready and for the morning may not be ready either. The rash. The door from the elevator leads to the room, a spacious room. The top light is a joke, but fortunately there was extra light. To the bathroom (also dark) leads another door from the fault. The room is very spacious, but. . . The door says ""sadistyc dentist"". Did he want to sleep in the dentist's office? Maybe someone has positive associations with the dentist, but the view of the dentist's chair, the treatment lamp and the couch did not have a soothing effect on me. She did not want to put her clothes in a medicine cabinet. Besides, there is a hanger in the room. The TV didn't actually work. In the bathroom taking a shower started me with fixing the cabin door. I wasn't really in a good mood when the shower tray was being tied. I'll add that the street under the windows is very noisy. On the plus side, the reception desk staff and good Wi Fi. Despite everything I will not come back - originality is not everything."
4885,"\ Self-defense Electronics Interesting, 100% understandable classes are very interesting, the knowledge itself enters the presence. There is no treasure trove of good humor. Friendly, student also a man. 1 Mr. Gryszko is a really student-friendly man. The credit for the presence, from what I remember one absence is half the grade down and two absences can be made up - further, unfortunately, the grade is falling. . . Nice food, lots of movement, nice atmosphere, a lot to learn. RECOMMEND!"
4889,"I've been to the doctor's appointment a few times. I think he's great. I'm probably writing clichés and repeating myself after the previous few words. Maybe someone will even accuse me of plagiarism.) . However, I have to admit that the opinions of the predecessors are not misleading, maybe with a few exceptions: - ) . In any case, I am very satisfied and ready to continue driving from quite a distance, as long as Dr. Ufnalewski continues to lead my pregnancy. I think he is really great and knows his stuff. He will explain everything exactly in a language that is accessible to someone who has no idea about it. He introduces an atmosphere of calm and matter-of-factness. He is the best doctor I know."
4890,"I just spent a weekend in Budapest, in this hotel and I have to say that I was very disappointed in 'em. He booked 'em (and paid 'em) 6 weeks earlier for a double room with a bathtub and when he checked in I was told that they had rented all the double rooms and the only thing they could offer me was a twin room. The two beds in the room were terrible and consisted only of mattresses arranged on a wooden frame. The main thing that annoyed me was the noise. All the doors had a vent at the bottom of the door that let the noise from the foyer through. However, if you stay here and offer you rooms 11 or 12, refuse and ask to be placed in a room at the back of the hotel or on the 2nd floor."
4892,"Um... . . .well, I'd also like to add my less and less flattering opinion of this doctor's approach to patients. . . . . . .yes, she's starting to treat patients as clients. . . It's a shame because it spoils the opinion. . . . . . .he doesn't care about her that much? I've been his patient for over a year and it's getting worse and worse. . . . .I'll be at his place for a follow-up visit soon and I won't miss telling you that. . . And we'll see what the next surgery will do. . . ? Greetings to"
4893,"I know guesthouses that offer not comparable higher standards. Everything in the hotel seems to be dirty and dirty. In order to use the bowling alley or billiards you have to sign up for the list which is opened on the same day on which the dishes are made after breakfast, that is after 10. 30 at the reception . Apart from the fact that all the attractions plus the pool can only be used from 12 o'clock. I must admit that we did not even dare to use the pool and jacuzzi because it looked massacred - very small and very unhygienic. When on the first day we asked if there are bathrobes, you are responsible for us and it will not be that day. As for the food, there is no choice at all. As far as the rooms are concerned, it's a mess. Dirt. Fungus. It stinks and spiders. I have no idea how this hotel can have 4 stars."
4894,"A beautiful hotel, staff training, or marketing training certainly took place because certain standards try to be kept, but for this you still need the right people who will follow the recommendations. Unfortunately the staff leaves much to be desired. I very much regret that a four-star hotel has such a low level of service. Beginning with the cleaning of the rooms - inaccurate, you had to be reminded to clean, to replenish the toilet paper after cleaning, poorly bedded beds, dirty dishes not cleaned etc. Bar service: you have to wait for drinks for a long time (about 20 - 40 minutes), instead of serving the customer first the bartender first packs the dishwasher. They seem to be all nice and smiling, but there is a lack of appropriate actions and behavior. There is not a single children's changing table in the whole hotel, in general, the hotel is more focused on business than individual guests. Not everywhere you can reach with a baby stroller. After reporting a complaint, the gentleman at the reception instead of trying to deal with the problem, started to find excuses and refer us to other hotel staff."
4896,"IT 2 labortoria No. 1 You have the opportunity, then go ahead and hit the leader! He likes students, does simple tasks and loves games - from what I remember, he plays passionately in Lineage `and 8."
4897,"Hello , Actually, the hotel staff can't handle more guests. A small number of tables and, consequently, the lack of free seats at breakfast, coffee from the coffee machine served from 1 pm: ) . The name of the SPA hotel has not much in common with SPA. The hotel ran out of bathrobes and towels / 10 November / . . . . We tried to make an appointment for the treatment three times. Unfortunately, but the working time is indefinite - they work when they want. We wanted to go to the treatment at the same time, but we did not succeed - incompetence of people who arrange the treatment, or incompetence of managers? Peace of mind, internet as it goes. Eating - lunches with cards without any choice - today for dinner, vegetable soup and spaghetti with spinach . It's a good thing that the beautiful countryside and the great weather compensated for the inconvenience of the hotel. With new finishes - 4 strokes, for service - ZERO"
4898,"Very easy to reach, the staff is very nice and you don't have to look for anyone. Eating warmly, choosing as in other resorts everyone can find something for themselves. The rooms are large and comfortable, but sometimes you need a little more attention for cleaning after the earlier guests. We do not regret that we would choose this hotel once again especially with children because they could not complain about being boring. We highly recommend!"
4899,"Let me put it this way: the percentage of credit at the level of 10% from lectures and 30% from exercises. The best grade in the number of two is 4 for the whole course. If you want to get a great physical education, I recommend it, but with a good grade it's hard and even impossible."
4900,"Hello ! Maybe the doctor is a great specialist, but my impressions after the visit ( private ) are not the best ! ! ! I was at the visit with my 7-month-old son who was diagnosed with AD before - she expected me from the doctor a more individual approach to the patient, some tips and advice. . ... then the child was seen almost from behind the desk, I was telling me what she used to do and the doctor just nodded or not. She didn't find out anything new about m! ! ! She was given 3 prescriptions for the ointment and here the most interesting - one ointment with an antibiotic that is not used in children and has a carcinogenic effect! ! ! ( this is what the pharmacist said ! ) - yes, the effect on the skin would be immediately noticeable but at what cost ? ! I warn all mothers of children from AZS to be more interested in what doctors prescribe to lubricate their children - STERIDES or ENGINE antibiotics ! Greetings"
4901,I travel a lot but I've never met such a terrible atmosphere in a hotel created by the man who rules there. The staff is intimidated and the rooms need to be slowed down every second because attention. . . . . . . . . . . . .they'll charge you another day! . If you can avoid this place...
4902,"Very nice hotel with easy access. It was nice to live there for two days and I'll remember it nicely. The business trip and everything was in the best possible order. The food was perfect. The staff was perfect and very helpful in every detail. If somebody has to stay in the capital, I recommend this hotel."
4903,"I don't know who's writing this gentleman good reviews, but I think they're friends. I have a different opinion and I sincerely advise against visiting him. As soon as our child and I entered the office, we didn't close the door well and Mr. ""Doctor"" asked what was going on. And the point was that our 4 year old son had his nose clogged for a month, and a cough that made the child vomit. After trying to be treated by a pediatrician (allegedly a virus), I started looking for the cause of this condition. There were no temperatures, so the doctors did not prescribe antibiotics. We found that it was best to go to the laryngologist and he examined the throat, looked into the ears and led us to a fiberoscopic examination. He didn't say anything about this examination, he didn't ask my permission but he went into action and started putting a tube into the child's nose. Apparently it gives an anesthesia, but not in our case. After the examination, which resulted in increased throat tonsils and chronic tonsillitis, Mr. pseudo doctor prescribed us attention. . . . . . .cough syrup probably 9 in turn. He said to heal the child and consider removing the tonsil. I asked him what to treat him with. He gave me a prescription for over-the-counter syrup. The night was terrible child was crying had problems with breathing in the morning we called another doctor. this in turn examined the method of traditional nose said that fiberoscopy in such a state is an unreliable test but PLATNOZA, DIAGNOSIS purulent sinusitis infection in the ear, the child very sick - the treatment will be long even 2 months of course antibiotics. A few days have passed and it is completely different to see that he is recovering. I warn you parents he is not nice zero approach to children such a buc. He doesn't say anything from himself you have to get everything from him."
4904,"We went with our family (6 adults, 2 children) for 4 days during the Christmas period, from the very beginning we were enchanted by the surroundings, lovely colorful houses and nicely landscaped area. Apartments are clean, well-kept, according to the description. For children, a playroom open all day, a large swimming pool for adults, saunas and an entertainment room just right for the evening. We only had a problem to book a bowling alley because you can only do it at the bartender's, but in the end we succeeded. A small restaurant (we got the information that we have to open another one soon), so if you get a popular hour for breakfast, there may not be room in the main hall but the food is very good. There is a parking lot underneath every house, which is a great convenience. Very nice service. We'll probably be back there :)"
4905,"The hotel makes an amazing impression. It is modern and very tastefully finished. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The view from the window is amazing. And that's unfortunately all I can say goodbye to this hotel. I was most surprised by the staff who decided to check the condition of the MINI BARK at 9 am during our presence in bed. The second shock was that the staff pointed out that going out with a cup of coffee from breakfast to the lobby is forbidden because it is suspected that I will steal a cup . Prices at the bar are 800%. ( slight overlap ) Tiles in the pool so slippery that the fear of coming out of the water . The cards in the rooms stop working at 12th . The food also does not knock you on your knees, but any criticism ends up in a mega waiter's pocket. I wish them the best but with such an approach to the client may be different with time. The manager, in my opinion, should focus more on the bullying of the service than on the customers ."
4906,"The PURO Hotel turned out to be a shot at 10. Rooms in the hotel are very comfortable - size suitable for a couple, high standard of finish. Bathrooms are very comfortable, a big plus is the lighting responding to movement and the beautiful smell of soap and shampoo: ) A very nice accent was also a bottle of wine that was waiting for us in the room. Touch panels very intuitive, ingenious solutions. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, patient and smiling, responded to every doubt and really felt an authentic interest in the quality of our stay. Breakfast served by the hotel very varied (fresh vegetables, fruits, juices), a large selection of breads, cakes, options for vegetarians, etc... I am sure that we will not use the offer of the network in other cities again, we will also recommend it to friends."
4907,"I think that this first negative opinion is very unfair and rather unfounded. I've been treating the Doctor myself for a year and a half with a poultice and I have nothing to complain about. I've had many times that Dr. Lorens has accepted me out of turn because I've just gotten terribly ill or I could only get out of work for a while. She can order additional examinations without hesitation and there is no problem with getting a referral to a specialist. It is also available 5-6 days a week, which gives a lot of comfort and security."
4909,Hotel location and building ok . The rest is overrated . Generally we are not satisfied because after the descriptions we expected something really better . The advantage is the chapel and the wedding hall on the islets. Generally there is no frenzy.
4910,"GOOD MORNING, I HAVE A LITTLE QUESTION FROM ANOTHER BARREL! I REGULARLY EXERCISE IN THE GYM, I HAVE DECIDED TO START TO TAKE A CREATURE WHETHER IT IS HARMFUL OR IMPEDING THE FERTILITY OR THE FERTILIZATION OF A WOMAN? ? ? MY WIFE IS ADVISING ME AGAINST IT BECAUSE SHE'S AFRAID IT WON'T MAKE HER PREGNANT, BUT IT'S NOT A STEROID, IT'S JUST A NATURAL THING TO DO, PLEASE AND THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR ANSWER! ! ! !"
4911,"Hotel nice only from the outside and disappointment inside. The floor sticks to the shoes, peeled furniture from the 90s, a mushroom in the bathroom and unfortunately what others wrote - yellow water. The staff say it's temporary but they don't want to believe it if you can see that the problem is repeating itself. It all led to the fact that I added a few dozen zlotys and spent the night in a hotel really 4 stars and you had to give it up. I would not recommend it."
4912,"""The device will resemble a classic breathalyzer. It will be a disposable mouthpiece through which the patient blows air. Then it will be thickened, and then the sensors will measure the concentration of a specific chemical compound,"" - said PAP creator of the device, Eng. Artur Rydosz from the Faculty of Computer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications of the AGH University of Science and Technology. The air exhaled by man contains about 500 different compounds, but scientists want to check four of them . The most important will be acetone, because its increased level may indicate diabetes mellitus. ""When we know how much alcohol there is in the exhaled air, we also know how much it is in the blood. A similar correlation occurs with acetone exhaled,"" said the PAP interlocutor. The device will therefore be able to diagnose diabetes or check the patient for elevated blood sugar levels."
4913,"I don't judge a doctor because I'm not a medical expert. I can only give you a good opinion, thank you once again, this time in writing, for your reliable and factual advice. Doctor Tomasz Olechnowicz will carefully consider the precaution in case of distraction, recommend, save and print. I have a fracture of the left humerus neck and had an uncomfortable, pressing plaster from which the doctor released me and applied immobilization in the stabilizer. This will significantly improve my treatment comfort for another 4 weeks. Of course, another visit from me, also from my husband on an agreed date with the medicine. Tomasz Olechnowicz ."
4915,"Well yes I have registered me to a doctor for a three-dimensional ultrasound, my pregnancy which will end up cc leading someone else but I am in 20tyg and I have a pregnancy at risk so she wanted me to know if the little one is healthy. I don't know this doctor so I'll speak up after the visit. But I have a request, has someone already done a similar examination with him? She would like to know if I know this doctor? Can someone tell me something about him? There are a lot of opinions here, but most of them are about the pregnancy and they are very extreme so I can't make up my mind and I am confused."
4917,"Unfortunately, you can't say much good about this hotel. I'll start with the pros. Nice restaurant and big deep pools, nice vegetation. That's all, unfortunately: ( . Horrible food. We didn't expect miracles for this price to be clear, but it was an exaggeration to see meat for dinner once a week. Generally speaking, apart from salads and vegetable dishes, there was nothing to put in the mouth. And don't expect something nice to surprise you in the next few days. 1 hot water dispenser for about 300 rooms . During dinner he wasn't there at all . You had to go to the restaurant for tea or coffee. The staff and bartenders do not even deserve 2 stars. They make drinks with a great deal of luck as if they were at work for punishment and treat tourists badly. You don't want to approach the bar. Animators are lazy, they encourage people to play. No energy in them. We really tried not to misplace ourselves during our stay but we could not. At the beginning we were accommodated in a room where it smelled like a sewer, the door squeaked, it felt like a school camping, where after one day she was thinking about coming back home. After our intervention, the room was changed to a better standard for the next day. However, strange things were happening there in turn. . . . .and neither I nor my boyfriend was drunk. Room 528 was just scary. And we don't want to talk about it, because whoever's there won't believe it. We didn't sleep 2 nights at all. And the plague of mosquitoes in the rooms, the smoke spirals on the insects just saved the situation. To prove some things we have taken pictures. You can write on a pipe5 @ o2 . pl would be happy to send a very good location to Rhodes and a cheap bus. 2 , 40 Euro . You can only get to Faliraki by taxi - $20 in 1 direction, unless you catch a bus to Rhodes and then another bus to Faliraki but it takes a lot of time. We gave up on the bus. Buy tours in Rhodes as a standard, because you will pay a lot more from the organizer. We recommend the Lindos expedition, a long boat trip, although picturesque. Entering the acropolis for this not comparably expensive 12 dollars / wasps, and the whole trip that lasted all day cost 20 dollars / wasps. In general, we were already in many hotels, for a similar price, in many destinations and various standards but this trip was definitely one of the worst."

4922,"I have been meeting with Anna for a few months now and I must admit that this is one of the better forms of investment in my life (if not the most fruitful). Without a doubt she is a professional specialist who helps me to understand many difficult elements. She listens and hears . She gives space for me to make my own conclusions. Nice, cordial, warm. After meeting with Anna I look at many things from a different perspective. It's not only conversations - many elements, conclusions, presents with the help of diagrams, thanks to which I understand better and remember the conclusions of the meetings more easily. I recommend meetings with Anna to every person who feels the need to understand and organize difficult events and relationships in their lives."
4924,"NOTE ! ! ! ! He makes a very good impression, he has a good attitude towards patients, but he is a typical doctor, who above all puts not on the good of the patient, but on the amount of money he can get from the visits. Because of his incompetence and, as it turned out, lack of knowledge, self-confidence and a bad diagnosis lost my son. Pregnant twins. . . . . . . .never with him girls! He assured me throughout the pregnancy that they were twins that everything was okay. . . . . . it turned out in 7 mc of pregnancy I have a transfusion syndrome between the closest TTTS, so they are monozygotic twins and I lost Igorek and Wiktorek had a lot of health problems, but somehow he survived.

4925,"I would like to thank Professor Andziak for the wonderful procedure of excluding the aortic dissection aneurysm. I was not a private patient of Professor Andziak or any other doctor. She signed me up for a consultation with her research file. For 2 years she was treated with a pharmacological treatment until the Professor finally decided that it was necessary to operate. I was informed in detail and in an accessible way what the procedure would consist of and what are the possible complications. She waited for the surgery for a few days. The surgery went without complications, the professor was available for the whole period of stay in the hospital. He answered my questions in a matter of fact and patiently. I think he is a doctor with a high personal culture, a warm and kind man and a great professional. Among the staff and patients he has the opinion of a specialist for difficult cases. A grateful patient."
4926,"Very good hotel, friendly and helpful service. The rooms are clean, quite large. The biggest advantage is the location - the hotel is located in the heart of Braga, provides a great base for exploring the city - all within walking distance. There are excellent restaurants nearby. An additional facility is a private car park by the hotel, no need to look for a place in the crowded streets. Price is ok."

The idea of the competition is to promote and award the activity of journalists who increase public awareness of the dangers associated with the most popular diseases of civilization, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and depression.

4930,"The video on YouTube showing the building and the rooms is stunning, which is in stark contrast to reality. From the room there was certainly no view of the sea. The room itself was claustrophobic. The order left much to be desired. There were no towels or toilet paper in the bathroom. Television did not work every other day. Wifi without access to the Internet. Generally it is a place where you go once and never again ."

All these qualities make up a very good doctor. However, Mr. Doctor still has many advantages, which are distinguishing and positively surprising - he captures with modesty, he is able to quickly gain the trust of the patient with spontaneous behavior, this trust from the perspective of the patient can be as important as skills and knowledge. Thank you for your time, valuable conversations, artistic execution of the procedure, and full commitment."
4933,"The big plus is the size of the room, it is not a small clinic and this is important for me. The price for a room is also very decent. The nice staff who even late at night will rent an ironing board or organize a toothbrush. ; ) Breakfast is as tasty as possible, although you do not leave the restaurant, informing that the time of breakfast is over. It's probably not that time that a guest has to eat quickly because the ladies want to set the chairs on the table. . . It would also be useful to replace the TV sets and enrich the channel package. Besides, it's definitely a plus."
4934,"I do not recommend this facility, among the many others in the area, there is really something to choose from. There's a terrible breakfast, a service, lying and cheating. In the cold, you say at the reception desk that there is a parking lot nearby and it turns out that there is no room for us. At breakfast, everything is missing and nobody is going to find anything, on Sundays there was no bread at all! The shop is not far away and the waitress shrugs her shoulders that the bakery can not reach and leaves. The wedges, the cheese are missing, not to mention the tomato, you can only help. The rooms in the other building have no reception in the pictures. Drama. Dogs. Of course there is no WiFi either."
4935,"I really like this hotel. This is not a ""star"" hotel but a very pleasant, clean, nice service. Breakfast in a nearby French pub. Location very good, 10 minutes to the main station, 200 m to a very popular street leading to the islands. I recommend. Price / quality / location ratio at 5."
4936,"The doctor diagnosed me with allergies to rice. The symptoms have subsided by 80%. The drugs she attributed unfortunately did not help to get rid of the feeling of a blocked nose. Unfortunately, the doctor could not help me fully. I was with her 4 times with a recurring change in her hand, which each time she treated with the same medicine of different name or antibiotic. With each visit, even a control visit she paid me full rate and after spending 500 PLN or more I have no improvement. I am unlikely to be looking for help with a change of hands with this doctor because I do not feel like paying for no improvement."
4937,"She was with her daughter at the doctor's house a few times in private, and from the first visit she did not inspire my trust. Lack of time for the patient, poor approach to children, too much does not explain what is a child, she had the impression that I pay 100 PLN for a prescription because she has been taking the same drugs for two years. Once she sent her husband without a child for a prescription, he did not write it out. We are looking for another specialist after she went with two daughters to the doctor, he said that there is no time too much (an appointment), he barely listened, saw the throat, did not want to hear what new ailments my child has, saw that the second six-month-old daughter has puffy eyes and said that she will also have an allergy like the older one, wrote a prescription, answered during the visit 2 private phones, deleted 190zł. . . . .all this in 12 minutes. . ."
4939,"Like most people, I was disappointed with this mower. It seemed like the company's mower would last longer. . . From the very beginning it was very delicate, good only for fine grass on perfectly even ground. Mowing on slight unevenness ended up with a bent knife. The knife was replaced with a new one after a year because it could not be sharpened. However, for a long time she was not happy with it, the engine started to work strangely. . . . .until it finally stopped. To be honest, my first cheapest no name mower worked much better. Nothing happened with the knife on the hills and holes, the engine was not to drive. If it wasn't for the fact that the wheels were damaged, it would still work. I was disappointed with the Gardena ."
4941,"I advise against this clinic too! ladies sitting in the registry not informed about what else they say on the phone, what else comes out of the payment ! and you have to ask for a confirmation of payment and still a great surprise ! ! ! I don't trust this clinic and I advise against it ! Exploitation ! ! !"
4942,"Hotel service is poor, not very polite. In the bar there is a continuous lack of it . The food is not very tasty, not varied. Rooms are ok, clean, large. Hotel in general. . . - over the content . . . I do not recommend . The hotel does not care about its guests. . ."
4943,"Minus: Not very polite service in the restaurant; very poor Polish cuisine; small rooms in the resort and in the cottages; Unfortunately, I had the unpleasantness of observing the owner's friends (a tennis group from Legia) who think that they are allowed to do everything, behave brazenly and rudely. atmosphere from Warsaw's Praga district but in branded clothes. Pluses: Nice hotel service; Good Turkish cuisine; Lots of places for walks Generally: expensive and not worth the price."
4944,"The doctor doesn't listen to the patient who is trying hard to explain what's wrong with him. The doctor underestimates it and says no about it. Eventually, after the pressure, she finds that we can make this change. He writes down a very strong drug, not to mention that it is a steroid and does not explain how to use it. The patient gets knowledge about it on the internet. As a consequence, the patient gives up the steroid and the skin problem is overcome by using over-the-counter emollients. Moreover, the doctor gives the patient leaflets of drugs for acne even though the patient has never had acne and a sample of a cosmetic (product promotion?). At the end of the visit, the doctor complains that he must give the patient a receipt. To sum up: 70 PLN thrown into the mud. I do not recommend ."
4945,"Mrs. Pruska was delivering my son in 1992. She was very unpleasant, she made fun of the methods of conducting my pregnancy by a doctor in my village. She was wondering why she didn't go to the birthing school, where in those years few people have heard about it, maybe in Warsaw. . . . The midwives in her company also allowed themselves to be pinched. When she asked me for a swimming pool once again, one of them said that I think she had already peeed all over the Vistula Lagoon! ! ! ! ! I strongly advise against this lady! ! ! !"
4946,"Hello... I'm not gonna write down. I'll write briefly and about. . . . Mr. ""FISH"" (Sorry, God) - Doctor, is the worst doctor she's ever met in her life. . . Dear readers (probably they will delete this opinion quickly, after all, the opinion counts) Mr. Lisiak is a terrible doctor for me. . He took more than one person in a severe condition and after a few days he discharged (although his health did not improve at all) in ""good"" condition. . He did everything he could for me. . As if I was watching an American movie. . . . I'm missing the words, Mr. Lisiak. . Vice Versa! ! ! !"
4947,"Unfortunately, I have to share the opinion of "" don "" and "" pan a . "" . I went to your doctor in the hope of helping me in the early stages of my illness. As it turns out, it is good that earlier she went m to my family doctor, who just after seeing my positive test results turned on the antibiotic, while waiting to see your doctor. The doctor was not very talkative, as in the case of ""don"" all the time she yawned and closed her eyes, at that time she did not listen to me, because after waking up she asked me to repeat what she said to me. Whatever she found out to me (and there wasn't much of it) was just an answer to my questions. If she hadn't asked me questions, I think she would have ended up paying for the visit. When she asked me about the intravenous treatment of this disease, she heard me answer ""noooo. . . . . .yeah, you might ask, see if your clinic agrees to give intravenous treatment. . . These are private appointments, sometimes people spend their last money to go to them because they know that they will wait a few months for an appointment with the NFUZ. Everyone can have a worse day, but it's not the job of a receptionist, it's the doctor who is supposed to LEAVE or at least not hurt. At the end of the day, the doctor misspelled the prescription, which she pointed out to me. To sum up: from the visit she gained me only a prescription to extend the antibiotic that my family doctor prescribed me earlier. Conclusion: I have to look for another doctor. Unfortunately, from my own experience I cannot recommend Ms. Szczepańska."
4948,"Opinion on the basis of the course Photogrammetry At the faculty : IŚ The way of conducting classes : chaotic Can he teach ? Niebardzo Podstawa oceny w indeks / zaliczeniu : 2 colloquia Unexpected: no sense of humour General approach to the student: unfriendly Lecturer from the Academy of Agriculture, so I think he is very interested in the content of the lecture, lectures conducted in the form of a thematic story, hence the professor often repeats with issues, the way of expression chaotic, hard to note anything, on colloquia relatively little time."
4949,"He didn't help. She reported me with chronic inflammation , the examination was accurate , detailed interview . Diagnosis: I have to look for the cause of problems in my head. Embarrassment . Lost money and time. I understand that you may not get anything out during the examination and the doctor may have doubts, but comment on them in such a way. . . . Nice and smiling, but it's not enough. I'll add that he wasn't thrilled when she asked me for an invoice for the service. It was my first and last visit to the doctor."
4950,"She spent a week in Vila Anna this summer. I do not recommend this place to anyone . Both the owner and the manager are very problematic. The stay was purchased as part of a package called . all inclusive soft . For each lunch and dinner there were two alcoholic beverages - a glass of beer or a glass of wine. The staff refused to issue them, giving illogical and irrational explanations. Meals were monotonous, carelessly served (spilled soup, each time), sometimes even burnt and tasteless. In addition, daily problems with the Internet, running water (failure twice a week), lack of lighting in the sleeping area made the hotel feel like an unwanted intruder, not a guest. I strongly advise against it, the only advantage is the direct proximity to the beach, quite dirty nota bene. I strongly advise against it!"
4952,"Cancer cells of bitches are a good model for testing, because the results can be translated into what happens in the female body. ""We live in the same environment, we often eat similar things. In both species the cancer develops spontaneously and slowly for many years. In both species, breast cancer is dependent on hormones and shows a number of similarities at the molecular level,"" said Dr. Król. Scientists have been conducting research mainly on cell lines and analysing animal tumour excretions. ""Of course, there is still a long way to go from in vitro testing to translating the results into practice and applying them in the diagnosis and treatment of breast and nipple cancer in women. This is my greatest scientific dream,"" the scientist stressed."
4953,"On our way to Warszawianka, we came 100km. Before arrival, she called me if the pool is open - she received an answer that yes. After entering the pool it turned out that only the sports pool and jacuzzi are open. The rest of the pool was disinfected. When asked how long it would take - ""maybe an hour"". After two hours the pool was not fully open. We went out disgusted. The lady at the box office answered that when we entered the pool she already knew that the children's part and slides were not working (we were with 2 children). She said that if we didn't like it, they wouldn't spend 2 hours there. If the rescuers told us that the pool would not be open for 5 hours, we would leave. But they told us that it would be open soon. On the other hand, what should I say to the child who enters the pool - we leave? ! ?"
4954,"It was the first time I've been to your professor's recently. She spent five minutes in the office and was not even examined! There wasn't even one question from his side: why did she come to me, what was the problem, etc.? He only focused on transcribing my results into his notebook and then he concluded that she should get me a referral to the hospital and we'll see. This ""advice"" cost me 100 PLN! I think it is a scandal!"
4955,"A clear reduction in mortality as a result of preventive measures can be observed as early as one year after their introduction, cardiologists, specialists in other fields of medicine and journalists stressed during the conference entitled 'Mortality Reduction in the Mortality of the Child'. The conference entitled ""How to improve the health of Poles"" . It was held on Monday in Warsaw under the patronage of the Polish Ministry of Health. Polish Society of Cardiology (PTK) . "" The stereotype that preventive actions bring positive health effects after many years or decades has become established in science. But now we have evidence that it is different. Research indicates e.g. . The research shows, for example, that as early as one year after the introduction of the smoking ban in public places, a decrease in hospitalization and mortality from cardiovascular causes can be observed"" - said Dr Tomasz Zdrojewski, Chairman of the Public Health Committee of the Polish Academy of Sciences."
4956,"The hotel is definitely overrated. The slogan ""Legendary hospitality"" does not fit in with this hotel, it does not stand out in this respect and is even below the standard * * * * * that other hotels have accustomed me to. Its only advantage is its originality, because it is a castle. By the way, this playground is not very interesting and not very modern, a standard playroom, rooms that are not equipped (for example, there is no option to order an iron for the room, you have to go to the ironing room). The prices are exorbitant. You can go there once to see up close, but there are a lot of much better centers in Poland, with a higher standard and much better facilities for a lower or similar price."

4958,"Suggesting a price, we expected something better. . From outside, the resort is very nice but as it turned out in the area of such a full (Giewont, Kasprowy) even with a better view of the mountains. Room not too big, balcony shared with the neighbors ( ! ) with a view of the neighbors' property (you have been using a concrete mixer since the morning) the mountains were unfortunately on the other side. In the price we had breakfast in the form of a Swedish table, we could choose something but no rarities. . an unpleasant surprise on the first day in the form of milk straight from the cow (two jugs - with cardboard milk and fresh milk) unfortunately not marked in any way and some people do not tolerate unprocessed product which was associated with stomach problems. . . Rather invisible service . The Jacuzzi didn't work, the sauna next to the exercise equipment where children and their parents practiced so it was hard to relax. The wifi seemingly available but very weak and what moments faded away also could not be used. To Zakopane about 10 - 15 minutes. To sum up - for such money we expected something much better. Will we come back? To Murzasichle definitely yes, to Sądelski Dwór definitely not."
4959,"The seven-year BioMed challenge is over. In 2015 the project will be summarized. It is already known that ""he brought up"" a whole generation of young scientists who know the specificity of work in research and development projects, know the importance of intellectual property protection, can use the patent base and know the basics of industrial property law. ""At the beginning of the BioMed project we organized a series of seminars on intellectual property. We explained how to protect intellectual property, when to publish and when to patent. We hired young scientists as technology brokers who, for particular research tasks, carried out a study on the purity and patentability of a given technology - enumerates Dr Laskowska. - Several technology brokers have been hired in the JRC EIT + employed. In BioMEda they support preparation for commercialization and establish relations with the business sphere. We are catching talented people, educated in the project, to work together with us"" ."
4960,"As in the title of the review, this is the best hotel I've had the opportunity to host at a similar price, spacious room, large bathroom, very helpful staff at the reception. The hotel has a large flat-screen TV, a well-equipped bar, a large double bed - everything exactly as it was written in the offer. The bathroom is also fully equipped, from the bathtub with shower option to the hair dryer. I will certainly come back to this hotel if I am going to stay in Poznan again."

He tries to help with the identification of the relationship, as well as with the experiments. The grades are good, even very good - I recommend : )"
4963,"He's not interested in patient problems. Prescriptions can be obtained by the receptionist without seeing the doctor. Very short time for the visit , Attempting to make more money for the patients. Does not inform about side effects of drugs . On the accusation she heard that she does not have to inform because each patient has a different body. She gained more than 10 kilos on drugs and only then she found out that they change her metabolism. On other drugs she had hallucinations, which she was not informed about either. The hallucinations were more than annoying, because she felt surrounded by me without a clear reason. For a long time she couldn't associate it with the medication I was taking because my condition was getting worse. She wasn't once warned by Mr Michałowski about such side effects, let alone asked how I felt. She herself finally came to the conclusion that the medicines she is prescribing me are wrongly chosen. P . Michałowski did not show the interest that a doctor should show. I strongly advise against visiting his office. Incompetence in 100% ."
4964,"Nice reception, but she made mistakes. A very helpful young man, carrying luggage! In the bar at 8 pm. 30 - 20 . 50 . the lady is cleaning the floor covering with a vacuum cleaner ! ! ! ? ? ? He hasn't seen 'em in any hotel yet. . . : ) Choice of food for breakfast - sufficient and tasty. The staff taking dishes - fast, sometimes too fast! Food on a plate, and they are already trying to take it! Parking - big, but not very functional. When it rains, it's muddy. And finally the hotel room - and in it the tools of torture in the form of seats stylized in the medieval style. The hotel management for punishment should sit on them after 8 hours a day. This is a horrible piece of furniture! It is a horrible piece of furniture! Scandal ! In the hotel * * * * * *? ? ? That kind of thing? TV program - no sport, no information ! . Besides, it's acceptable, but a lot of * * * * * * star hotels have better rooms. This is not the hotel I would return to. Not this class, not this price !"
4967,"Located a few minutes walk from Termini Station is the ideal starting point for a trip to Rome, nice service, well maintained, comfortable rooms, varied breakfasts, great coffee, free internet available in the rooms - the same advantages, no reservations, it was my next and certainly not the last stay in this hotel,"
4968,"Hotel by the Sagrada Familia . It takes about 25 minutes to get to the centre by subway. Well located, clean, well maintained. Breakfast is very fragrant as it is in Ibis. However, it is worth eating in the city to enjoy the charm of Barcelona. To the subway 5 minutes on foot. Very friendly service, you will receive mape and information with tourist attractions."
4969,"Lenka's mother When my daughter fell ill, she got my phone number from a friend to Dr. Dura. She called me to ask if she would come to listen to my daughter. After less than an hour the doctor was already at our house. She was very available. Extremely warm approach to the child. She patiently listened to our questions related to the proposed course of treatment and thoroughly explained how to proceed. What is the most important, she was very precise in what she was doing. She listened to my daughter with great accuracy and calmness on her first and then also on her follow-up visit. Dr. Dura not only focused on the problem that we are currently reporting, but also gave us some advice for the future regarding our daughter's health and development. If we happen to need advice, help with our daughter's health, we will only want to talk about it with Dr. Dura. He is a respectfully recommended doctor."
4970,"""In young people in Krakow, we have found significantly increased concentrations of compounds that indicate the development of inflammation in the body, such as reactive CRP, which, by directly affecting the endothelium, can cause impairment of vascular function,"" - said Prof. Professor PAP. Button . This suggests that the inhalation of polluted air, especially long-term inhalation, promotes the development of inflammation, which is the starting point for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Importantly, the pollutants have significantly worsened the function of blood vessels in overweight or obese people. These results have prompted scientists to take measurements of vascular function at times when average air pollution varies significantly. It turned out that in periods with significantly exceeded standards - especially PM2 , 5 dusts - the blood vessels functioned worse. ""The situation of our blood vessels in the period of particular pollution can even be compared to that of smoking a cigarette"" - commented prof . Button ."
4971,"After visiting the doctor with my five-year-old son, my faith in doctors returned. The doctor by vocation, she explained comprehensively what was wrong with the child, she immediately examined my son's hearing and directed him to the proper treatment. The son had a mild hearing loss after having an ear infection. I decided to visit another laryngologist, who only scared me and told me that it was necessary to remove the third tonsil. The doctor definitely advised me against this procedure and calmed my fucked up nerves. I strongly recommend the doctor, she has a great approach, great knowledge and great modern equipment. The son feels better, the prescribed drugs helped, he can hear almost normally. I hope there are more such doctors!"
4972,"To be honest, I have mixed feelings. . . I was with the doctor several times, at first I was very happy, but with time, unfortunately, less and less. During the last visit, the last thing she could say to me was that she had a feeling that I had been thoroughly and thoroughly examined. Since the treatment proposed by the doctor did not have any effect, she changed my doctor, who made a ""slightly"" different diagnosis and proposed effective treatment. . . . The doctor is undoubtedly very nice and friendly, but I don't think that's the whole point. I'm certainly not going to come back to her."
4973,"Until recently, patients with advanced melanoma had a chance to survive on average several months after the diagnosis. Thanks to immunooncological drugs, more and more of them survive for many years, and experts hope that in some cases they will cause a complete cure. ""Let's remember that these methods came into use a few years ago. That's why we don't know at the moment whether it is a complete cure or just a long-term remission of the disease,"" explains Dr. Zagozdon. The researcher emphasizes that in Poland immunooncology in this modern understanding is just beginning to develop. One of the centres that are leading the way in this research is WUM. The university conducts, among others, research on monoclonal antibodies in the therapy of some lymphomas. They are directed by Dr Magdalena Winiarska . Dr Zagożdżon, in turn, investigates the role of oxidative stress in the immune system."
4974,"This situation definitely needs to change. Those who make hotel reservations through group purchasing services deserve full and transparent offers, as well as decent treatment and respect,"" stresses Łukasz Dąbrowski. What has changed in the perception of holidays planned through group purchasing services compared to 2010 is the awareness of customers. The most important feature that customers pay attention to when choosing an offer is the price (51%), but the second is the trust in the company selling the offer (12%), the next positions are taken by the amount of the proposed discount and the location of the facility. The weakest points of a reservation made through group purchasing services were: worse treatment ( "" was treated as a second-class customer "" - 28% ) and lack of people responsible for explaining the consistency of the service with the offer during the trip ( 19% ) ."
4975,"The hotel is located in Garajau - a very beautiful and climatic place, quite close to a charming beach by the ocean (in our opinion one of the most beautiful on the island, an additional attraction is the cable car ride). In Garajau there is also a quite interesting statue of Christ the King, and following the path from there towards the cliff you can enjoy a wonderful view of the cliffs and the assessments, we recommend to go there for a walk and fall in love with the island on the first day : - ) Thanks to the fact that this is the only hotel in this town there are really few tourists and you can feel the climate of the real Madeira (as opposed to hotels located in the hotel district of Funchal). The hotel has everything you need: shops, bars, cafés, laundries, taxi, bus stop, from where you can take a bus to Funchal in 15 (travel on the local roads adds to the attractions: -) cost 2, 2 euros one way). The rooms in the hotel were cleaned daily and very carefully, daily change of towels, in addition, from even a room with a view of the garden there is a wonderful view of the ocean. The hotel service is very good. Breakfast is monotonous, but good, everyone will find something for themselves, we recommend dinner in the hotel restaurant, every day a few dishes to choose from (also local!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In general, the hotel deserves a very positive assessment: - ) The only downside is that the room was often heard from behind a neighbour's wall or a person from the corridor, but this largely depends on the behaviour of the people accommodated next door : - ) Recommended ! ! !"
4976,"Arriving at the hotel after an almost two-hour journey and. . . . . .silence at the reception. Waiting time for login 40min ! It turns out that the hotel signed a contract with Polish tour operators to guarantee rooms in BH, which means a backyard building under the amphitheatre! Absolutely not meeting any standards, fermented ice-cream in trash cans in the corridor, mushroom on the walls and dirt on sticky greasy floors. This place is generally for the Poles, I talked to the Germans, a little jokingly they said that these are VIP rooms. In the hoteu hardly anyone understands German well, but I guarantee that this is the only communicative language. As you can guess, the Germans are located in the main building (the one from the picture in the catalogue) In the corridor on the sofas - bugs, so you can see who the first day is, sitting there! After the first weird bites he goes with a drink to the terrace. The only man who wants to help tourists is a hotel boy (Mahmud) just ask him, the rest is some kind of mistake. For rooms in a normal building you have to pay between 140 and 290 euros on the spot! There is no other option ! The kitchen is cleverly organized - if there is fish today and stays on the platters, tomorrow there is fish soup. Meat dishes for medicine and in line. The beach kitchen was a rescue - there were chips: ) The a'la carte restaurant - they chose this Mediterranean - was a shame. We have been traveling for years, but we never had such a situation, served food almost in thimbles, on plastic tables (those from the beach). The rooms were cleaned in 4 days, here standard 2 euros. But interesting stories were told by the guests e.g. ok . 20 . At the reception desk at 00 00, asking for toilet paper, declaring that the room was cleaned by the guests themselves, they would only have something to look after. To sum up, understanding the language in this case was a curse for us, we heard them talking about Poles (broken German) It was the worst holiday in our life, I warn those who save the whole year to fly on a holiday of life - This is not the place, this hotel does not deserve even 4 * and the staff is far from civilization, it is a pity because to Turkey we like to fly the most. . . The only plus! A CONVENTIONAL SPA for ridiculous money (two people full package of 169 euros) not to be received in other hotels for this amount."
4978,"Last week I got my camera off, which she wore for a little over 2 years. Even though she saw me changing while wearing the camera, what she saw me right after I was taken off, knocked me on my knees! She couldn't imagine that my teeth could be so pretty and straight. . . . I'll just add that she was getting to Dr Piotr's office a few hundred kilometers from Rzeszow. She tried her luck in other surgeries, but only regrets the wasted time and thus money. She came to Dr. Piotr by order and I absolutely do not regret that she entrusted me with her smile! For all those who wanted to have the effect once and for all: the treatment lasts and you have to be patient, this man knows what he does! I know this perfectly well on my example, because my smile was disfigured by other doctors and it was only Dr. Fudalej who led him to his present condition. I recommend Dr. Fudalej and thank him again !"
4979,"The hotel does not really reflect what is shown in the pictures in the travel agency catalogues. We went to the Arabella World Hotel with the Best Reisen Group and unfortunately I must admit that we were treated as tourists to those ""inferior"". The hotel consists of two buildings, but there is a gap between them in terms of room standard. We have been accommodated in the old part and unfortunately the rooms and bathrooms left much to be desired. The bathroom has cracked tiles, broken sockets at the sink. . . The staff left a lot to be desired. Monotonous food, every day the same. The child had nothing to eat, because most of the meals were dishes with specific Turkish spices and meat. . . hmmm. . . . . .let's say yes: all on one hoof only in 100 different ways. The beach is nice, but you had to take a few steps to get to it. In general: I think you can hit a lot better with similar money."
4981,"I was at your doctor's for an unreimbursed visit to Dolmeda. Unfortunately, the visit was quick, prescribed antibiotic (without a throat smear) and other medicines that did not have any effect. The throat is still sick. The only effect is 210 PLN less in the wallet (visit 90 PLN and medicines 120 PLN). It was the only time and I will not use it again."
4982,"The cooperation between the two companies dates back to 1994, when a subfranchisement agreement was signed for the Radisson brand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. ""Carlson and Rezidor have a long history in common and have grown together over the last 17 years. Therefore, the joint presence on the market is another natural step in their development. ...says Hubert Joly, President and CEO, Carlson. According to Kurt Ritter , Rezidor's President and CEO: ""The aim of this step is to increase the company's profits and shareholder value and the business partners' perception of the new brand as a global hospitality company offering more attractive and consistent values to guests."
4983,"How much can a two-star hotel in Gorzów cost? Two hundred zloty and in promotion ! Well, I used to stay in four-star hotels cheaper. So maybe in this price we get some higher standard? No. The hotel offers an average two-star standard: an uncomfortable bed, a small work table, a horrible bathroom with rusty faucets. Breakfast does not even deserve two stars. I wanted to write 'em about a plus one but . . . . .nothing comes to mind."
4984,"I found Mr. Doctor pregnant by accident, state, when my gynaecologist was on leave. The examination was carried out very gently, I was informed about everything (even the details that doctors usually do not say), the doctor did not underestimate the hard abdomen and having found that I was taking too low a dose of drugs, he referred me immediately to the hospital. . . . .just in case, because it's better to prevent than to lead to misfortune. At the same time, the atmosphere was very nice and calm."
4986,"Mrs. Sylvia, I'm also a patient of your doctor's - but I'm treating myself privately. I have a PCOS, which is a polycystic ovary. First I hear that the size of my bust has anything to do with this condition. I have an F cup, so if the PCOS would stop my bust from growing, it would never grow. What bothers me the most is the constant fight with weight. I've always been slim and all of a sudden I've got problems with my weight. It got 76kg of 60kg. I've also been having problems with my menstruation lately. Bust size has nothing to do with PCOS. However, I agree that it was necessary to commission a study in this case. I don't know why the doctor didn't do it."
4987,"A common method of testing spatial memory is computer testing: the test person sits in front of the monitor and moves in virtual space by moving the mouse. A person subjected to such tests does not move physically. For this reason, in experiments using computer visualization, only visual memory can be tested, not idiotic memory. That is why the Nencki Institute has built a test stand for testing idiothetic memory in humans under conditions of natural movement in space . The site - one of only two in the world - has the shape of a circular arena with a diameter of several meters, surrounded on all sides by black, thick curtains. The arena is darkened and soundproofed from the environment. In order to further reduce the impact of external stimuli, the test person is covered with a special eye patch and earphones, which additionally suppress external acoustic stimuli. ""The task is simple: walking around the arena in total darkness and silence, one should return to the starting point. The return begins from that place in the arena where the sound appears in the headphones"" - describes Dr Justyna Skolimowska from the Nencki Institute. The current position of the arena is recorded by a computer program thanks to a camera installed on the ceiling."
4988,"She treated me for eight years, in CZD. Very busy, but always full of interest and commitment. She was patiently explaining and explaining, answering every question about the disease, ordering all the necessary tests without any problems, carrying out good diagnostics. She has an individual approach to the patient, which is very important for many years of treatment. I have a nice memory of the doctor's treatment."
4989,"Admission to Algebra and Geometry Aunt Dorota - because she got such a nickname from our group is probably the best leader from C-11. The lecture leads at a very fast pace , you turn to a buddy to borrow a pen , you turn around and you do not know what is happening now on the board : mrgreen : Relatively easy colloquia , extra tasks , very friendly approach to the student , make the class to this lecturer , until you want to walk . Everything is done without stress and in a really friendly atmosphere. She is like a good aunt who will always help: - )"
4991,"To be honest, this phone is hopeless. I bought it because of two cards - and this is tragic. When you dial a call, the phone doesn't give you a choice which card to dial from, it only dials from the main card. So you have to hang up and only then the option to use the card number 2 appears. The next thing is that when you receive an incoming call, you do not know to which card it is directed. If someone connects a private card with a business card, you do not know (when the number is not written in the book) whether to expect a beer invitation or an invitation for business negotiations. In general, I advise against it. The last topic to be discussed is the time to make calls . Just a drama. The call you dial from the book and . . . wait . 20 sec , 40 sec , minute until the phone finally connects to another . No - na - dzie - ja . Visually ok, but the phone has to work and not look."
4992,"The rooms are terribly cramped, stuffy. There are supposed to be cabinets ""locked"". and they don't shut up anyway. The showers are tight and connected to the lavatory, which makes them queue. Hostel staff is tragic they have no idea about running something like this, it changes the conditions of stay after reaching the hostel, and also in its TRAKEY. Breakfast that can be ordered is not suitable for the number of people. There is a terrible noise in the hostel because the floor below is a disco."
4993,"I decided to see your doctor for two reasons. First of all, good opinions, secondly, you are conducting periodontal consultations and informing that you deal with diseases of gums, mouth and mucous membranes. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find such a specialist, so I decided to trust them, because the price given in the price list was not too high. The doctor may also have knowledge in this field, but it is very general and equal to the generally available knowledge - non-medical. The doctor may have knowledge in this field, but it is very general and equal to the knowledge available to the public - non-medical. The consultation looked like a statement that my problem doesn't look good and you have to go somewhere else to get advice (by offering some doctors from other, distant cities.) . The office itself, which is located in the house leaves much to be desired. I didn't feel comfortable in it, and the cleanliness wasn't at a high level. Another matter is the timeliness of the doctor. After having made an appointment for a particular hour, I was not accepted, and another patient came in instead of me. When using private services, however, there should be a standard, but in the end we pay for it. And as far as the payment is concerned, another matter is that the doctor will charge himself a higher price for the service than he was in the price list when registering for the visit without informing you in advance that the price will be higher. Personally, I don't recommend it, but I advise against it, especially for those who have a more serious problem. The visit was a waste of time and money for me."
4994,"According to the university authorities, this is the first such device in Poland. It was equipped with a state-of-the-art Centre for Medical Didactics and Simulation launched at the beginning of the academic year, where students learn on phantoms resembling real patients and in rooms modelled on real operating theatres, delivery rooms or ambulance simulators. Presented on Wednesday, the device looks like a traditional autopsy table. However, its upper surface is a huge touch screen the size of a human being. By touching it you can freely rotate the models, cut them in any plane, enlarge specific fragments, add or remove individual organs or systems - e.g. blood or nervous. The ""Library"" of the device contains anatomical model of a woman and a man and 100 detailed cases . Moreover, lecturers can upload their own MRI or CT scans and display them in 3D form. The system also includes two 80 inch televisions, so even a large group of students can listen to the lecture on anatomy."
4995,"The IPC PAS message indicates that changes in the concentration of oxytocin itself in blood do not clearly determine whether the examined person has a tendency to autism. Before a diagnosis is made, the concentrations of at least a few other substances (biomarkers) would have to be checked in a characteristic way related to the disease. ""Our chemical sensor for the determination of oxytocin is in fact only the first step towards building a more advanced medical device to diagnose autism predispositions. For some time now, we have been working on layers of polymers that react to the presence of two other compounds associated with autism: melatonin (which should not be confused with melamine) and gamma-aminobutyric acid,"" stresses the research project manager, Dr. Piyush S . Sharma ( IPC PAS ) ."
4996,"Both kidney implantation surgeries took place on Tuesday, simultaneously in Warsaw and Szczecin. In the capital city, they were performed by specialists from the Institute of Transplantology and the Chair and Clinic of General and Transplant Surgery of the Infant Jesus Clinical Hospital in Warsaw (under the direction of Prof. Kwiatkowski and Dr. Rafał Kieszek). In Szczecin, they were performed by a team under the direction of the Head of the Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation of the Provincial Hospital Complex Prof. Marek Myślak and Dr . Tomasz Śluzar from the General Surgery and Transplantation Department of the same hospital . The organs collected from donors were transported free of charge by LOT airplanes by persons authorised to do so. ""We prepared an emergency version in case the weather conditions did not allow for air transport. At that time, ambulances would be sent from both cities to meet halfway between Warsaw and Szczecin and exchange the kidneys donated by the donors"" - said prof . Kwiatkowski said . The idea was that after the removal of the kidneys their transport would not last longer than six hours until the implantation."
4997,"I agree with the negative opinions concerning the holiday stay 23 . 12 - 26 . 12 2016r Lack of hot water, unsuccessful Christmas Eve, ice rink closed, cold water in the swimming pool, reception desk absent etc . The only thing they do well is to charge a fee . I advise you not to go around this hotel with a wide arch."
4999,"Hello , Noise from the very morning 06 : 00 on the side of the massacre building site was not going to sleep ! ! ! We were not informed about the disruption. / Cottages without air conditioning after 35 degrees went to get a job in these booths. Failure is not recommended. ."
5001,"A guesthouse worth recommending to those who appreciate peace of mind and comfort of stay. Nice staff, tasty breakfast and a great atmosphere of the Manor House. Charming Manor House in fact is more beautiful than in the photographs of the gallery. We will want to go back there. Location ( Mountain ) forces to march effort or use the car ( in case when walking is troublesome ) . It is worth going back there !"
5002,"We are just coming from Zakopane and from poverty and hunger we were looking for something like an inn / restaurant. After leaving Radom, the first place that we saw (unfortunately!!!!) a hotel at a fat one, as well as a restaurant and bar. If we were interested in something for dinner with children, we chose a restaurant. A total failure. Maybe I am used to different standards, but every Chinese in Warsaw has shrimp with soya noodles on his card. The price of this dish is in the range of 15 - 20 PLN. What the ' restaurant offers ' - 100g / 35 zł . Choice of dumplings - tragedy . There are dumplings only with meat and cabbage . It is rare that there is not even one type of dumplings without meat. But it was done in time. Children, despite their love for this kind of food, have already given up, so even what is there, did not cause admiration. But children ate soup. Despite being served in splashed plates it was tasty. Bread for the soup was a little hard, but let's not get bogged down. I ate the toasted potatoes (tasty), my husband ate the loin (also ok). The salads were still good. And that's it. Fried beetroots - on average, but it is possible to eat them, while fried carrots are not possible anymore. The service stands out. Thank you for giving one card for 4 people! This comes closer to the family : ) Okay, no more jokes. No qualifications, no taste (greetings for a short leather skirt) . And at the end, 15 more minutes of waiting for the settlement . Husband had to take it himself, because the ladies suddenly stopped noticing us. . . Well, it's hard. I hope I never wish you that again! : )"
5003,"A perfect place for a short holiday. Rooms in the pavilions in Scandinavian style, clean and warm. Possibility to use the kitchenette on the plus . Underground access to the spa and restaurant forces you to walk a few steps, but is not a nuisance. The meals are varied, tasty and nicely served. Only the behaviour of other guests who simply cannot behave in such a place can be annoying. Maybe a sign in front of the restaurant door with information about clothing and appropriate behaviour could help. The pool is not too big, but you can relax in moments when there are no flocks of children in the pool. Lack of enforcement of adequate preparation from guests to enter the sauna - wet swimsuits are not the only problem. Despite some inconveniences, rather due to the guests themselves, the stay was successful. We will certainly return there more than once."
5004,"The hotel is very cool especially if someone goes with children a lot of attractions for them such as a monkey grove, 3 playgrounds, a swimming pool with very hot water, a room we had 2 people with an extra bed standard plus 17 meters. I do not recommend it for families with children is very tight but we booked it consciously. As for the weekly stay I have no major reservations about the food very good everyone will find something for everyone, only at the departure we had a small incident to the room I was credited with a deposit for the bathrobes that I have never seen before but the case was resolved positively. I recommend this hotel and I will certainly return there."
5007,"She's always available so far. For half a year she has been treating my 5-year-old child with good results - we can forget about constant inhalations, syrups and medicines (which she has been taking for two years). Now two granules a day are enough. It's a wonderful feeling when you don't have to run after doctors. I recommend it! ! !"
5008,"Unfortunately - probably 5 years of waiting for the next AC / DC album disappoints - it's not that the band is an advantage to play the same and the same for years, but what a return to the sources as long as the previous records I run with pleasure and on almost every one of them you can find the so-called . gems this here is about 35 minutes of boredom sounding the same / maybe in two tracks different / - no solos no idea - such a tasteless gum in the style of AC / DC. . . well bought 'em and put 'em on the shelf among the band's other records and I think this production will be very rarely played. . . . .other records remain: )"
5009,"The hotel looks pretty good in the pictures, but in fact it is nasty. It certainly doesn't deserve a 4 *, maybe a few years ago it was better, but now it needs a major renovation. It's not clear why I wasn't connected to the wi - fi. Poor breakfast. . . Luckily, I was only there for one night, surely I wouldn't last much longer - a warning against more prudent hotel choices for the future. The only advantage is the nice service and proximity to the central station in Bologna."
5011,"Unfortunately, Dr. Oplawski did not help me. I live in a small town, where the hospital has a bad reputation, so after the gynecological ultrasound was performed, a multi-chamber ovarian cyst was diagnosed (oh, my God, what is it! the doctor also asked if my children are already adults). ...decided to look for a good doctor to operate on me. Mr. Oplawski also advertises himself as a specialist in oncological gynaecology, and based on his good opinions she decided to entrust him with her own health. After a private visit, during which it turned out that the super ultrasound does not work, and on the second camera available, the photos came out worse than my gynecologist in the province, they made an appointment for a visit to the hospital clinic, she was supposed to have a thorough examination and set the plan and scope of surgery, i.e. whether it is to be radical, or whether we prepare the intestines earlier (in case of cancer) I will add that going to Krakow is a problem for me (and a cost) due to the fact that she raises 3 children on her own, including one disabled. On the fixed date of the visit, which lasted maybe 2 minutes, the doctor said on the basis of previous research, and I quote ""it does not look so terrible"" and set me a date for the treatment. She had to do all the tests at her expense before the operation and eventually it turned out that the operation was carried out by another doctor, he did not remove the ovary (????) although I am after the menopause and I do not understand why he did me, he just peeled out the cyst. Histopathology seems to be unsuspecting, but after the operation I still feel bad all the time, and after 4 months, the cyst was found on this ovary again!"
5012,"We came with a partner to see a doctor to confirm an early pregnancy. The holiday season, she got me stains, and we were away from home and my doctor. Unfortunately, during the examination the doctor did not find the embryo (30 days after the transfer). He was very empathic and tactful, he certainly understood what it meant to us after 5 years of infertility treatment and first pregnancy. We were broken down. Fortunately, 3 days later my doctor found an embryo and a beating heart. Dr. Hassan-Bartz did not inform us about the correct yellow body (on ultrasound it was measured as a gestational follicle and was measured on the outside and not on the inside). which, however, gives great hopes for a proper pregnancy, and this would be an important information for us because it gives hope for a correct embryo. The doctor also used it in the Doppler study, although, as he admitted, it should not be used at this stage of the pregnancy. I hope it won't harm our pregnancy. EDIT: Unfortunately, we finally lost the pregnancy in 10 weeks. And two more comments. The visit began with a comment that the doctor does not like the presence of partners at the gynaecological examination - I have not received such a comment for 5 years, and my partner, because of our many years of fertility treatment, often accompanies me in the office and I think it was an unprofessional comment. During the visit there will always be a moment when you can tactfully ask your partner to leave the office, you do not have to do this in the first sentence right after the couple enter the office. Secondly, she had a rather painful gynecological examination in my opinion completely unnecessary since she came to me for an ultrasound. The doctor didn't tell me why this examination was done or that it would hurt. I think it was unnecessary, especially since she reported me an early pregnancy and spotting. I think this is a big minus for the visit."
5014,"Conditions in the hotel very decent, view of the Giewont - a fairy tale! The service is nice (except for a young blonde girl from the reception, who seemed to be disturbed by customers). . For breakfast, you could request scrambled eggs (with additives at your discretion), which were fried ""in front of the eyes"" of the customer. Prices with Groupon revelation, except for him, hm, let each judge individually, because it depends on the wealth of the wallet, the location is great. Unfortunately, the swimming pool and other attractions in the hotel are open in hours that do not give the opportunity to take advantage of, because it is time to wander the trails. If we go to Zakopane again, it will be Hyrny. Marriage from Gdansk"
5015,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE ! ! ! The doctor prescribed me (which I found out after some time) for prolactime (pituitary tumor) without any head CT scanner because he found out that the cause of my irregular months is too high prolactin ! ! I ended up losing more than 15 kg in 2 months, I couldn't sleep, eat, function normally, which was moreover for me a period of examination session, but because of my zero functioning the case ended up for me with a compulsory one-year health leave. Luckily, after some time I got to a good endocrinologist who told me to stop the medication immediately and I recovered and I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm also fine, in no examination has I ever been surprised by the increased prolactin. IN SHORT, THE DOCTOR'S TREATMENT HAS ENDED FOR THE YEAR TAKEN OUT OF MY YOUNG LIFE. I don't understand how a person with the title of a doctor of medical science can make unproven diagnoses and expose the patient to health detriment. The only advantage of a visit to Dr. . . I understand now why."
5016,"I bought it at the store without listening. I connected to Klipsch RF 62 ( on 39m2 ) . And I can tell you that to watch movies of explosives shooters etc is OK. The problem starts with the music. Disco - upu - cup ok . but after 2 months of rehearsal (analog and through fiber optic or hdmi) of musician's clip, light jazz, blues or pink floyd on the sacd is just DNO and 6 meters of silt! ! ! ! I'll add that streaming or Internet radio works faster (in a friend on Yamasha) and on a 3-year-old Denon avr2000 (and this one, at least in stereo, was much more sophisticated)."
5018,"A terribly unpleasant service. The standard of the rooms is inadequate for the price, the beds are so soft that they easily fell off. There are children running around the corridors on the colonies and slamming doors. In the restaurant there were tables reserved for the colonies, so there was no place to have lunch. Despite the paid stay by the bookings, they demanded a fee for accommodation on departure, claiming it was unpaid. A terrible claimant attitude. On the day of arrival, they said that parking was free of charge, unless due to a regatta, a day later at departure they demanded a parking fee. We have a terrible taste left."
5019,"We have already visited this hotel many times. Everything is on the right level. We spend Christmas here, we come on holiday. No matter what time of year it is nice. Good breakfasts, only too few coffee machines (2, so with a higher occupancy, a specific coffee queue). There is also no fresh juice on breakfast, which is unthinkable with 5 * and prices for accommodation. Nice but small spa. Café with a beautiful view of the sea."
5020,"Kitchen Definitely NO ! ! ! Either heavy tempers (calf) or even heavier coatings. Generally, for someone who wants to lose weight the perfect place - I walked 'em 2 days hungry. The only little teddy bear in the food is the breakfast - they were still somehow positive compared to the rest. The room is nice, big, clean and tastefully decorated. But. . . . . .controlling the temperature in the room is quite a challenge. Television on most of the channels is impossible to see. It would also change the shower end for a more modern one."
5021,"The assumption was that the monument gains in value rather than loses in each year, and therefore the concept of depreciation in the common accounting sense is irrelevant in this case. I did not assume, therefore, that the money invested in the manor team will pay for itself in a moment. Kombornia Manor is certainly not able to give as much profitability as would be on any other business ."
5022,"Another stay in an Ibis hotel. This time Grudziadz . When it comes to cleanliness and rooms, of course, everything is in the best possible order. Unfortunately, there is one thing missing - the atmosphere in the hotel ""barbed wire"" comparing Gdansk, Torun is poor in terms of atmosphere! ! ! Another big one is the reception desk. Unfortunately, I did not notice the commitment of the staff, I did not feel like someone expected. I would like to point out that in Gdansk or Torun is 100% better. The restaurant at the hotel is supposed to be Ok but waiting for the bill or interest in the restaurant guest on a scale of 3 to 10. The food is not adequate for the price of a portion. ( very small portions ) . Generally Clean and rooms on 10 , atmosphere on 3 . Having a choice between cities definitely Gdansk and Torun . Ibis Styles Grudziądz of necessity"
5023,"She bought me and my family a Christmas package. We had 2 rooms on the first floor, one of which we had to replace immediately after arrival, because we were greeted by a big wet spot on the wall. The decoration of the rooms gives a lot to think about what is hiding underneath the wallpaper, which one night it was half covered with an innocent sleeping person. Bathrooms are ok, but the rest of us remember the game times. The corridors of the hotel massacre, everywhere makeshift, you can feel the moisture, not to mention the omnipresent darkness, which in the main dining room caused that you did not know what you were consuming. The food was good, not much, jagged: (and we had the impression that there was a lack of basic products, mainly for children. But waiter Adam full of professionalism and culture. Animations and games for children ok, Santa also. However, the whole hotel is screaming: EXCLUSIVE ME! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
5024,"In 2012, Dr. Bieniek did an eyelid correction. He was a nice man at the qualification visit and during the surgery, so I was surprised that after the nurse took the stitches off, he didn't find even a minute to see if everything was okay. The nurse had a problem pulling out the threads, so she brutally jerked off, which caused the wound to partially disintegrate. After two months the scars were very visible and although collagen gel should not be used in the eye area, she decided to treat the scars with an ointment and after using 2 tubes and more than six months, the scars are almost invisible."
5025,"I came to you with a chronic shoulder pain. She had an MRI plate, but the doctor said that without a description (which she did not have) she would not tell me anything. The first doctor who asked me for a description at all, usually everyone looks at the record. After a short interview, without any examination, he wrote me a number of referrals for various treatments. All in all, everything is cool, if someone is expecting referrals for treatments, I highly recommend it."
5026,"3 days stay in winter for business purposes with a group of colleagues . The location is quite interesting, close to the amphibians but sympathetic to the summer patients, as the windows of the center will hit the colonial center probably (cottages from the dictate, playground, fireplace, etc.). The food is terrible, scrambled eggs like powder, 20 minutes before the end of breakfast half of the dishes are not there and 10 minutes before the end of service is food. The service on one side ""servant"" kind but on the other side unpleasant, spraying and pretentious. Trying to talk and establish a menu for a group is practically impossible."
5027,"I recommend this hotel mainly to families with children. The swimming pools at the hotel are 3 plus to this Aquapark . As far as food is concerned there is also a choice for dinner every day there is a different theme such as Mexican cuisine, Chinese etc. The service at the reception desk is nice without any reservations. Rooms, i.e. bungalows with a kitchenette equipped with plates, mugs, pots and cutlery. As far as the cleanliness of the rooms is concerned, it could be better, although for 3 * the hotel was ok : ) If I was to fly to Lanzarote again, it was there : ) I recommend : )"
5028,"The advantages of this hotel, which I can name is: - location ! (from the gondola only a short distance from the road, which is very important for me as a mother of two small skiers. I already have such experience that even a 200 m walk in ski boots with children can be a nightmare ; ) I also recommend using the ski deposit at the upper station of this gondola - leaving the equipment there saves a lot of energy ) - renovated clean room and bathroom - very decent (the four of us lived in a top room and there was really a lot of space and comfortable beds and pillows, bathrobes, slippers, hair dryer, TV, WiFi, mini bar, very large and comfortable shower cabin, good cosmetics. . . ) And cleaned daily! ! - renovated restaurant and nice, fresh food - very friendly and helpful staff - supposedly a great renovated swimming pool, saunas and spa, but we never got there because the bathroom was so nice after those skis.) In general, I recommend it very much - especially with children! I don't remember the drawback :) Last year in another (four-star) hotel of the same family we had excellent food, so maybe I missed it a bit, but each of us always found something for himself!"
5029,"The Doctor gives you the feeling of being factual, pleasant and sympathic. She very efficiently performed the examination in a very small child. She was recommended by a friend who treats herself and the child with the Doctor. One star less for the chaotic organization of work and that we entered the office thickly after the agreed time."
5030,"I've had labs with him and I recommend as much as possible no trouble or nothing : ) As for the humour, it is a bit specific and not everyone laughs at it, it's mostly a bit of a trick or an attempt to make you laugh, you can laugh not only at the lyrics! At the lecture it's even cool, but it's always easier to have a second term, and it's better to go on improving it. I RECOMMEND"
5031,"Hello , The medical interview contains many elements that can help you to understand your medical history and make a more accurate diagnosis. The price of the visit varies from whether it is just a consultation, a consultation with an examination, a periodic check-up, whether an EEG, sleep EEG, QEEG and of course how long the visit lasts. For my part, because of the bias, of course ' No assessment ' : ) I wish you health: ) Piotr Sobaniec"
5032,"We spent a lovely week in the hotel in March. The service was as usual exceptional. It was our 5th visit and every time it gets better and better. Quieter than usual, because in the winter season, but the stay was equally successful. We met a lot of nice people here and we always liked to play boccia with them. We went to the à la carte restaurant and, apart from one evening at the Sofa restaurant, we were very happy with the service. Every day there were new animators, besides the usual band. The whole staff deserves the highest praise for their careful and friendly service. We had a very nice time and hope to come here again this year."
5033,"The hotel is smoke-saturated with cigarette smoke, is located in an old tenement house, no elevator, breakfast buffet with poor quality products. Despite the smoking ban, the Romanian guests there have smoked, the furniture is old, the air conditioner also. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone. The service staff, if they do not want to help, they say that they do not understand English. The coffee is a nightmare, it is best not to touch anything there."
5034,"I spent five days in the resort (I especially write - ""the resort"" because it is not a hotel). The first days were an integration trip - it was fun, Country Club met our expectations. A nice place, not the worst food, a lot of alcohol - generally it was OK, except that we were asked to leave at 12:00. . . . ( ? ? ) . That day, even the night did not bring bad memories: ) Breakfast - a Swedish table, quite poor but you could not complain. The next days were business meeting - and here the bad feelings began. The rooms turned out not to be cleaned for 5 days ( ? ??), not even changed the towels and did not bring the toilet paper (but as mentioned by em it is not a hotel). The bathroom leaves a lot to be desired - a mushroom on the wall, a falling board, etc. Not to mention the cobwebs on the balcony and at the entrance to the building. Dinners only until 7:00 pm - later you could not order anything to eat (with snacks to bite - of course your own spirits, only fried sausage). Billiard Club - what they left us one day was not touched (and most importantly cleaned) for three consecutive days. To the advantages should be added access to the marina, incredible surroundings, peace and nature around: ) For the price of a good hotel standard in the area we found an average colonial standard (apart from a TV set - 32 inches LCD, which did not suit us at all;). )"
5035,"You pay for DAB + , which in Poland is unfortunately still in its infancy. The tower clearly lacks some power. Apparently, all micro towers are limited to ok . 30 watt, but that's not much for such a mediocre sound. Although - as in the case of Philips - it does not go below a certain level, but now I regret that I did not buy em cheaper, but much better sounding mcm2350 (not to mention the higher models, also small). The bass is very flat and bland, sopranos like that. It can be to the kitchen - but in the bedroom, where you would like to listen to good sounds in the evening in silence, it fails. It's only suitable as a breakfast and pottery player. I advise other Philips (the same design line, but better playing). It should be noted, however, that remote controls are just as hopeless everywhere, navigating the usb files is tiring."
5036,"I am absolutely shocked ( negative ) by Mr . dr . She was looking for a good dermatologist for my two small children ( 3 and 6 years old ) . I was recommended to me by this friend of mine, who used the services of Mr. Dr. Dr. . Not only was the doctor extremely unpleasant, but also the way she treated my children and the way she examined them is criminal! She examined her older son as well, even though she made a wrong diagnosis, because it is already known from what she has had lesions, but this was stated by the paediatrician, she did not even advise the younger daughter to get up from behind the desk and look closer at her skin, touch it, etc . The diagnosis, as long as it lasted 2 minutes and it is only a guess, she was not even prescribed any medication. For these two scruffy diagnoses she paid m 200 zloty (100 zloty for each child), then she showed me her surprise about the price, and Ms. Dr. Dr. answered disparagingly that the two children were. Scandal ! ! ! ! ! ! Such an unprofessional dermatologist, a doctor she did not see in her eyes. It is said that this happens in the state, but to treat such small patients privately for 200 PLN is unthinkable! I am so appalled by this doctor's attitude that I will make an official complaint against her. It is good that I have a witness of her behaviour."
5037,"She was on a 10-day family holiday in August 2016. The hotel requires a comprehensive renovation! There is no star ! ! ! She had a large bunk room with a balcony, comfortable beds and a comfortable bathroom. And so much for the promises. Unfortunately tidied up once for my urges, towels replaced once. Even for toilet paper you had to go to the reception desk. No glasses or jug in the room. The spa - tiny, dirty, cold pool and musty smell; jacuzzi - didn't have the courage to enter. Mould in the changing rooms, lack of proper ventilation. We used to go to the pool to a nearby hotel. Recreation - bowling alley - 1 closed bowling alley, 2 broken; billiards - destroyed; dulcimer - broken; only good foosball - for a fee; the compensation was supposed to be vending machines with toy Chinese food set up all over the hotel. The only thing we used were beach volleyball courts. Outside the beach - not cleaned, not leveled, water bikes and boats available for a fee. The lake - clean . Restaurant - breakfast and dinner - simple menu quite monotonous but good and fresh. Unfortunately, there were some cups and spoons missing. One kind of tea and coffee. The biggest minus is the lack of restaurant and bar facilities except for designated meals. It seems that there is a bar, and when it comes to alcohols, out of the three she mentioned, there were none, and fries ordered at 15. At 00 we got the fries at 16. 00 . You can see that you save on everything, even on lighting - long and dark corridors, you can barely see the room number. And the best 80 - 90 % of guests are colonies. The only advantage is the weather, which made it possible to relax outside by the lake, and good mood: ) ."
5039,"I was halfway through the Doctor's yesterday (Medicover package) A seemingly good specialist, all that was due, but a terrible murmur, it is hard to hear what he says. I had to summarize it to my husband because he didn't hear anything at all. The customer service is rather poor - the subject matter. The visit lasted 15 minutes. During first trimester service I was with another specialty and I see big differences in approach to the patient. If I have a choice in the IIIUSG pregnancy package, I will try to make it a different doctor."
5040,"The hotel is located right on the beach, right on the border with Sopot, very close to Ergo Arena . Very good place for families with small children . Very nice service at the reception, for children small gifts. The hotel has a large playroom for children well equipped with various toys, xboxes etc. The hotel has a swimming pool, fitness center, two courts, outdoor playground. Food, rooms OK. The studio was spacious, with a wonderful view of the sea and a massage chair."
5041,"A very professional and nice woman. She approaches the customer with warmth. She explains everything in turn so that after the visit you know what it is about. The only downside is a little bit poor conditions in terms of decoration and equipment, although I do not know the equipment at all and I may be wrong here. . ."
5042,"The problem with the knee was quickly underestimated by the doctor who did not do any examination except inspect my shoes and found that I have flat feet and it is the fault of the knee pain. . . . .only that it's strange because of one, the left one ; ) he opened the drawer and took out a leaflet from a company producing orthopaedic insoles and handed it to me saying that they are the best and cheapest. . . I was missing the words for the whole situation. He left my office with the impression that LUX MED was pulling money from me. . . . .I won't go back to that doctor again."
5043,"Coffee is ok. The foam is also good. Unfortunately, while making coffee, water flows out of the tray. What's more interesting, not every time you make a coffee. I even made coffee without a tray with a plastic box and water flows nicely into it. When I put the tray in sooner or later there is water under the machine. In the shop they said to press the drawer but it doesn't work. They weren't surprised by it. I have no idea when and how the water flows out. Generally, the capsule maker is a failure and mature em is a mill and machine"
5045,"Despite the good opinions about the doctor, I do not agree with them. A very average gynecologist who does not stand out from the others . What's more, the doctor in my opinion is panicking, I understand the care of the pregnancy is associated with risk and responsibility, so I think that the doctor should be mastered. I have been advised to go to the hospital because of the higher pressure, which is why the doctor decided to give an early birth because of the good condition of the child. \ I was very unorganized in the hospital and I did not know what to do. After the diagnosis of another doctor it turns out that the child should stay in the foetus for at least a week. Maybe it's a slight increase and a lot of work for the doctor, but it was connected with a great inconvenience for the patient."
5046,"Very pleasant 2-storey hotel, nice service, very clean and cozy rooms. Interesting arrangement, you can feel like in the palace even though it is a 3 * hotel. Bathroom quite large, large shower, but poorly lit, lack of mirror lighting - problematic for women; ) however, makeup can be done with a large mirror in the room. In front of the entrance there are benches and a gazebo with a grill. Go to section 4 *, where the restaurant is located by a small guarded car park (payable). Guests of this facility can use the entrance to the swimming pool, sauna and not only for 25 zł. Free, monitored parking at the hotel. At the next visit to Silesia I will surely still visit this place. The price is very decent. With a clear conscience I can recommend this hotel."
5047,"The worst doctor she's ever had to deal with. He ran my pregnancy under a Lux Med subscription. At every visit he was chattering about things, and that daughter Kasia was coughing all night, that she was negotiating the price of the apartment in Wilanów, that the father's ambulance took away, that he got a bull's-eye poison and had to lie under an IV. . . The massacre, all my fears were underestimated, ""what do you know, you want to bid? ""I told him that my stomach is hardening very often, that it hurts, and that if it hurts, let it hurt, that if it hardens, let it hardens. . . The gynaecological examination never had a m, he kept saying ""when I look at you I know you'll be fine"" what is it? Doctor or clairvoyant! ? ! ? ! At each visit he regularly measured my pressure. She changed my doctor, who immediately referred me to the hospital, my neck is so shortened that I am in danger of premature birth, which is only 26th week. I advise against it! ! !"
5051,"Run as far away as you can. I unfortunately bought 'em out a day and it was a tragedy. In the room there was a broken window, streaks in several places, stench of feet, strong chemical agent, terrible conditions, a swimming pool with such chlorine content that I couldn't breathe, I was collecting me for vomiting. Never again. . . . . . ! ! !"
5052,"She was at your doctor's office 2 times and 2 times late for work. The visit lasts 5 minutes ( 120 PLN ). She is not very talkative and she felt like she was working for the punishment. I am 30 years old and I am pregnant for the second time. I already have a 4 year old daughter. She was treated like a 16 year old who had a fallout. She answered my questions with her voice raised, as if she had a grudge against me but I do not know what. I do not recommend it is cool and for 120 PLN I expect something more."
5053,"The doctor won't say the best. Directing to basic skin tests (I don't know why for inhalation, because I know perfectly well that I don't have allergies to things flying in the air and that's what she told me) . For food. . . I also know that nothing will come out of the basic. But ok. I'm not a doctor. Besides, she's nice and answers all the questions."
5054,"Until 30 years ago, if a man with a heart attack survived and was hospitalized, the doctors could only fight the effects of a heart attack and not stop it. The patient spent several weeks in a lying position, and after being discharged home, he was immediately on a pension because he was unable to work. ""In fact, in the initial stages of infarction treatment it was the doctor and the patient was vulnerable - in the early 80's the patient was lying down for a month, 2 weeks were not allowed to move. At this point the patient with an uncomplicated infarction comes home after a week if we make this vessel accessible, and it functions perfectly normal,"" - said Tuesday to journalists prof. Andrzej Lekston from the Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, formerly the Provincial Centre of Cardiology, where a modern model of myocardial infarction treatment has been developed, which has spread throughout Poland and allowed to save thousands of patients."
5055,"Another advertorial Dr. Samokar and Mrs. Ordinator - they got together like in a poppy cork - both unpleasant and arrogant. such times are gone that the doctor is Lord and Lord. A bit of understanding for us - patients - a bit of compassion, heart, pity. Father was dying in the Intensive Care and Anaesthesia ward in Lubin with Mr. Doctor and Mrs. Ordinance. Will you think that someone talked to the family, what is it about, why is he dying, how can you help? the opinion of the doctors in Wroclaw was completely different. it's a pity that so late she looked for help somewhere else. My father died. Nobody even expressed their sympathy. These are the correct parochial diagnoses. It's a shame that such teachers give such a fry."
5057,"My husband and I were organizing a wedding reception and rehearsals at the Tajty Hotel. Two stars for the location and beautiful views . Nevertheless, the rest, and especially the hotel staff leaves much to be desired. Vodka was not spread on the tables after 1:00, guests had to go to the fridge and take it themselves. Warm meals served on the table of the bride and groom at the very end. No one in the room was cleaning at all on the day of the wedding, and on the day of the amendments almost no one was cleaning at all. The hotel was 95% rented, and the lady at the reception made a scene on Sundays that the guests did not return the keys. These guests had just paid for another day at the hotel two hours earlier, as well as no organization. However, the biggest disgust leaves a situation where the witness asked the staff for help in cleaning up one of the guests. She was told to clean up herself and said that the bride and groom should take into account the fact that somebody can mess it up and they should clean it up themselves. The question then arises, why did we pay so much money for the wedding? I sincerely discourage everyone who is willing to do so. The views do not compensate for how we and our guests were treated."
5058,"I don't understand these negative comments. Value for money - a revelation . Very nice interior, the room may not be too big, but with a bath and a balcony, clean. Large selection of dishes in the restaurant, intimate drink bar, nice service. Possibility to use the swimming pool, sauna or bowling alley all day long. Plus a free ride on a horse in a saddle and carriage, even in the autumn weather, plus a bonfire and a feast table for the price. I really can't complain about boredom. The price is very good, and the conditions are at least good."
5059,"He was there with his wife and a two-year-old child. They chose this hotel mainly for her to have as little trouble as possible with her. And I can actually recommend it for families with small children. There is a very gentle descent into the pool so you can have a child who can walk and even crawl in the pool, of course without letting him out of your sight: ) . The food is all day long. It was a very cool Turkish night in the canteen. Sometimes it was tight in the canteen, but in other resorts it was also in the top with 'em. What I could complain about is that the dinners are from what I remember until 21, but often around 20:30 everything is cleaned. The alcohols and drinks aren't really great. But let's take this opportunity to remember that this is a Muslim country. It will always get worse there. The beach is close, but not enough sunbeds. To find some pretty close to the beach you have to leave early. What's worse is that the beach is narrow and sandy only in front of the water, after entering the water there are immediately stones. For an adult it is a little discomfort. Worse for younger or older people. For bigger children slides, some animation, evening performances. . . . The airport bus ride from the airport is almost 2 hours. A little tiring, but what did I know about it before buying a trip. The dominant language is actually Russian. To sum up, this hotel recommended me for families with children. Of course, I've been in better, even much better, but also the prices were correspondingly ""better"" then."
5061,"The hotel sells its offer in Groupon. If you buy and pay, don't count on your ability to book a place in this hotel. It's one big scumbag, like there aren't any more places, just when she called me individually, not to mention Groupon, these places were all for the date I was interested in. The company's sales policy is not about customer satisfaction. In a word, scammers and swindlers do not buy this hotel in Groupon."
5063,"They spent two weeks at the hotel and it was ok. The hotel is not the latest but has everything you need. Breakfast and dinner are good, you can have something interesting to eat every day. There is a possibility to get a lunch package, you just have to report such need at the reception. We took advantage of this opportunity when we went to the mountains before breakfast. The hotel has a nice location but you have to go up a bit, it is close to Krupówki. The hotel is quiet, which was very important for us. The service is helpful, cleaning without problems. I recommend it to anyone who does not expect luxuries but beautiful views, good food and peace and quiet."
5064,"We were here on vacation with two of our little children, who had a lot of attractions. They had animation classes with animators, during which they had fun and had no time to get bored. The rooms were not too big, but still we spent our days outside the room. The food was of medium quality. The location of the hotel is beautiful. Peace and quiet ."
5065,"I have a different opinion about this doctor. He was obstructive, he treated me in advance, too me, he didn't explain much, I have the impression that he looked at the research and didn't read much of it. The doctor should have written on the page in which area he will be exactly patientized. Deleted 250 PLN and no details of the condition. Unfortunately, I do not recommend it. I am a patient who has come out with nothing."
5066,"I was at your doctor's for a post-treatment check-up, which she did to herself because the previous doctor made me mycosis and other horrors. She found it on the internet, read my opinions and went to m : ) I'll be honest with you, doctor. He's taking as much time as he needs. He does not rush at all, he even says not to hurry, does not create embarrassing situations, the atmosphere is great. He explains everything, shows on ultrasound what and how, asks questions and gives advice. What is important is that he examines his breasts and encourages him to do it. He did not treat me so I can not say anything about the effects of treatment. I know that he will be my doctor because he is my doctor by vocation: )"
5067,"I do not recommend this doctor after the whole treatment with strong antibiotics for the alleged candida, my whole digestive system has been destroyed. He recommended me to all possible specialists privately of course. I was treated for several months. A lot of antibiotics . A few at a time. To this day I can't cure the effects after his treatment. . . She was sick of it, but this treatment was even worse. I was treated for a long time after the drugs that Dr. Potatoes prescribed. Unfortunately, he didn't think I was allergic to gluten. I warn you before you tempt yourself to visit Dr. Potato, consider if it is really worth losing a lot of money and most importantly, health! ! It's true that he recognizes candida in everyone, because we all have some."
5068,"I once had a chance to see the room and contact the owner. Level below criticism in both cases . I still remember the family celebration that I had to pass in the "" restaurant "" and not because of the sublime taste or other aesthetic feelings. To sum up: TOPORNELY on each level."
5069,"The dishwasher is easy to use thanks to the subtitle display. It cleans well. I think she preferred the cutlery basket to the top drawer, but it's a matter of getting used to it (more time-consuming arrangement). The middle basket is slightly misshapen (too small an angle) compared to older models - there is water left in the cup bottoms. I do not have a comparison with other brands - I do not say anything. This is my 3 Amica dishwasher, the longest one has worked for the first time - 10 years without the slightest fault! The second one was only working for 2 or 5 years - the wires on the door were constantly breaking. I hope this dishwasher will be as durable as the first one."
5070,"He was treated for stomach ailments by Dr. Granecki. The man is open, communicative, quite dart in his thoughts, not to say too darts. Okay, he cures, he knows, so he doesn't comment on it. I was just surprised to save me every week for an appointment, let's say a check-up, although this type of condition is cured practically once (opinion of another doctor). It's nice that the doctor wanted to see me at the check-up, but doing 4 or 5 checks is already a lightweight business and not a treatment. However, I am able to swallow it. Unfortunately, the ultrasound done on the doctor and interpreted by him as a liver enlargement has driven me a lot of unnecessary fear. The repeated examination on the new equipment in another place ruled out completely the diagnosis of Dr. Granecki. I understand that a mistake can happen, but since you're already working on scrapped equipment, you'd have to take the correction to make a serious diagnosis. In short, Doctor, if business is on good equipment, and profit generation is not necessarily through endless controls...) Greetings, Maciej."
5071,"The hotel turned out to be a huge profession. Its location in the Eur district away from the metro station does not provide comfortable access to the city centre. The hotel staff is probably still learning, and they are not always able to behave properly in relation to guests. The hotel corridors have broken walls. The door of the room in which we lived had our hands dirty throughout our stay and nobody cared about it. Small rooms . Our four-person family got a room of about . 20m . Two double beds were put there and the children had to sleep together in a bed 20cm from ours. We were assured that the room we received was quiet, while opening the window made it impossible to sleep. In the bathroom the broken shower door was repaired after two days of our stay. Breakfast was simple, but enough, without any panache. We are certainly not going to go back there."
5072,"In the morning, at the same hotel, I go to the reception desk to deal with the formalities related to the arrival of the group of tourists I expect. Behind the top a different receptionist, but the situation is as if the same: she is talking on a mobile phone, every now and then laughing rather little discreetly. This time I have no patience anymore. I start talking about what I mean by trying to interrupt the conversation. The receptionist pushes the handset away from the ear for a while, nodding her head and answering - but not me, but someone on the other side of the cell - she bows down."
5073,"I bought 'em, despite the store's opinion, to take something better. The price is certainly attractive, but the flash drive itself is reportedly a lottery. Different components are used so you can hit the pretty reasonable product or get wet. I unfortunately got 'em wet. The speed of writing is bearable and the reading speed is quite good, but only when you are dealing with large files. However, the time to access data in my model is a tragedy. The device can hang itself from browsing folders with large number of files . When copying a large number of small files the speed is embarrassing . It looks like that when you save after throwing in 20 - 30 smaller sets of pencils it hangs for a few seconds . I strongly advise against a model with 64GB capacity ."
5075,"Successful stay ( next ) . Hotel - clean, well equipped rooms. Hotel - quiet - despite a large occupancy, located next to the park (additional advantage). Very nice staff. Breakfast, dinner - tasty, varied breakfast. Massages - high level. Swimming pool - clean , hot water . Saunas - dry, steam hotel - worth recommending (for those looking for quiet relaxation, relaxation)."
5076,"During the conference entitled ""The future of the . During the conference ""Participation of Polish scientists in international projects"" prof . Jerzy Walecki , Chairman of the Committee of Medical Physics, Radiobiology and Image Diagnostics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS) in Warsaw, pointed out that the conference is to show, among other things, . He said that the conference is to show, among other things, ""how we are a scientifically talented nation"" and how important it is to maintain cooperation between foreign centres where Poles work and Polish institutes and universities. The specialist emphasized that Polish scientists make very interesting discoveries concerning, among others, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis. Professor Tomasz Trojanowski from the Medical University of Lublin assessed that regenerative brain medicine is a very important field. For many years the scientific community lived in the conviction that in the central nervous system there is no regeneration of those areas which are damaged by disease processes. ""Recent fascinating achievements of medicine indicate that there are possibilities to induce regeneration in the central nervous system, which is a great hope for patients who are affected by various nervous system diseases, including strokes,"" he said."
5077,"Reading the reviews, I'm glad that the Doctor has helped so many people. But I can't say he cured me. On the contrary. My mistake because she believed in the Doctor and didn't even ask me for a second opinion. Dr. Wszoła qualified me for the surgery, without any detailed examination. During the operation itself it turned out that it was not necessary. After the operation she had serious complications, inflammation of the intestines, haematoma, adhesions. It is more advantageous for the hospital to take money from the NFZ for the operation than to refer the patient to the examination. So far I have been suffering from postoperative complications."
5078,"We spent two nights in this hotel in July 2014. We decided to take a quick walk to the hotel because of the swimming pool, despite the fact that the hotel is about 15 minutes from the centre of Karlovy Vary. Unfortunately, there was no air conditioning in the hotel, so with a temperature of + 30'C, the room could not withstand. The advantage was a hearty breakfast, very tasty cold cuts and cheese. The hotel staff unfortunately has problems with English. The hotel is focused mainly on German tourists."
5081,"In 2005, the FDA, in response to a request from green tea makers, concluded that there was no reliable evidence that drinking green tea could be associated with the reduction of certain types of cancer: lungs, intestines, oesophagus, pancreas and ovaries. The FDA also stressed at the time that there was limited evidence that drinking green tea had a positive effect on breast and prostate cancer prevention. A year later, the same organisation reported that there was no evidence that drinking green tea could be combined with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. In the same year, however, the same organisation gave a positive opinion on the ointment made from green tea. According to prof . Amarowicz , there are, however, studies which indicate a positive effect of green tea. While carrying out animal studies, it was noticed that green tea was 50% more positive in mice. It inhibited the development of intestinal cancer. In Japan a group of 40 thousand people was observed for several years. It turned out that in this group the mortality due to cardiovascular diseases in people who drank at least 5 cups of green tea was 25% lower than in others."
5082,"The product is of excellent quality and is intended mainly for people with gum problems. Thanks to the thickened formula, a small amount (even half a cm) of paste is enough to apply to the brush and after a while, a rich foam forms in the mouth. The paste has a strong mint taste, smells good, and its salutary effect on gums can be seen after just a few days of use. The product, due to its small size, is worth buying if, for example, we go on a business trip for a few days (we can easily fit the tube into a beautician). However, it is not worth buying this product when we intend to use it at home. It is definitely more profitable to buy a larger package."
5083,"Great hotel. Everything at the highest level. Wonderful atmosphere . Wonderful staff . No shortcomings . Not even a problem. Such a hotel is a rarity. The attention to the smallest details makes us feel exceptionally good here. A restaurant and meals at a very high level. The hotel is not the cheapest, but worth the price. I highly recommend it."
5084,"The heart of the Pole starts to age earlier, about 30 years old, but this process is gradual, as is the gradual decline of the male sex hormone - testosterone. The heart of a 35-year-old is forty, a fifty-year-old is 60 to 65 and a seventy-year-old is 80. In women, the heart ages more rapidly. At the same age as the metric age, it is only in young women, generally up to 30. . . . .and at the latest by 44 years of age. In women aged 45-59, it is the same as in men of the same age, i.e. 60-65 years old. Then, after sixty, it ages faster than men. The heart of 70 years old Poland is already 95 years old, according to NATPOL research."
5085,"The hotel is located in a nice place. Around the forest, fields, meadows - especially now it delighted me a lot, because the nature looked beautiful. At the reception desk there is a very nice staff, comfortable rooms with sufficient equipment. Pool hmm in the pictures impressed me unfortunately in real life no longer (a definite disappointment). Jacuzzi well to renovate - ripped grilles which is and a little dangerous and certainly looks very unattractive. There were also active saunas - steam and dry. There are also 3 saunas available but during our stay was closed. When it comes to meals here a great bow to the cook. It's been a long time since I was so happy with the food. The meat just melted in my mouth, very big choice and taste it for me at 6. When it comes to the attractions for children, there is a playground outside but a little tiny one should definitely be made a real square because there were a lot of people with children. In the playroom inside for kids available "" cinema "" . . .toys and Xbox. In general, the stay is very successful and I do not exclude the return, and I will certainly recommend friends to visit this place."
5086,"She had a medical consultation with the doctor about my stomach problems. The second time she had a gastroscopy and an initial diagnosis - biliary reflux. Advantages: - factuality, - efficiency in carrying out gastroscopy, - courtesy Minus: - poor communication, poor history, at the end she had to ask me what was wrong with me and why; she found out very little m - lack of information on the part of the doctor about the further course of treatment (she received only a prescription for the drug even without any guidelines on how long I should take it). - lack of comprehensive medical advice on the need to follow a diet and avoid situations that may aggravate the condition - no referrals to other, further studies confirming 100% biliary reflux and/or excluding other conditions (ultrasound, faecal examinations, bilitec 2000 . . . )"
5087,"Dental service at the worst level . In a shortcut: she went to the dentist's office with upper right pain 5 . First, I was diagnosed, or may I be sure that 5, a panoramic picture (100zl) - I was not informed about the costs - I was even forced to do it. After about 15 minutes you still did not know which tooth to treat (despite the photo). After the diagnosis, a dressing was done (doctor's note). The total cost of the visit is 250 PLN - photo plus medicine. Total cost of root canal treatment in this office = 1 000zl - of course she had to ask me herself. As soon as she saw me - without sitting in the chair, she immediately found out that it is canal . Statistically, you make an appointment very quickly because of the very small number of patients."
5088,"""I think all my activities and activities are closely related. I strongly believe that a good lecturer and professor is when knowledge is firmly embedded in the practical and theoretical matter of a given field. In my clinical and scientific activity, endoscopic research and reproductive medicine are of particular importance. I also carry out intensive didactic activity, supplemented by work in the clinical field. At this point in time, my research in the field of endometriosis-related diseases is linked to laparoscopic operations and laboratory work,"" Professor Tinnenberg told PAP. Prof . Antoni Basta and Prof . Kazimierz Pityński in the laudation emphasized that Professor Tinneberg is a valued author and co-author of 136 works published in reputable scientific journals; he has a special achievements in the field of procreation research, endometriosis and endoscopic surgery and diagnostics of early pregnancy, as well as research on the impact of environmental pollution on the reproductive system."
5089,"After the first visit to the doctor I am very pleased. I got to him in 5 weeks of pregnancy with TSH 16. After studying a few articles on this subject on the web and in the magazines I had a lot of fear, how it will affect my pregnancy, baby. The doctor, in addition to being nice, has a sense of humor, he has explained to me reliably and competently what my condition is, recommended treatment, put out the internet fire. It's really worth it! After the recommended treatment, 11 days later the result dropped to 9, so I think I'm on my way. From the heart, and even two I recommend : - )"
5090,"The hotel is very clean, the service is very nice and professional. The only downside is that every day for breakfast is the same, there is no variety and fresh vegetables for breakfast. The hotel is in a great location, very close to the center of Warsaw and on the other side of Wislostrada you can rent city bikes."
5091,"He's been 'em twice, on business and with his family. Every time, without fail. Tasty food, clean rooms, nice service. Cool thing: they put a bus that you can take to the slopes. You have to pay extra for it, but it's still a big convenience, because the car stands on the hotel parking lot all the time, and it saves you time and money."
5092,"The room, decoration, position of the ratings objectively I can not, but the overall impression leaves a tasteless. Due to a sudden illness, we did not manage to get to Mountain Paradise. Until the last moment I was hoping to recover, but unfortunately, the night before, I was forced to call an ambulance. When I wrote to the staff, explaining the situation and asking them to postpone my reservation and the money I paid for a different date, I got the answer that I had been flooded for a long time about the illness. I am terribly sorry. For the future, I will try to plan for severe bronchitis more in advance."
5094,"Poorly trained staff working without commitment, not paying attention to guests. Lack of climate , atmosphere of cold service . Neither goodbye nor welcome again . Meals of poor quality as for the price and place . Dinner dish served cold, without the fancy taste and chic that we expected in this class of premises. General evaluation of the restaurant's work is low. I do not intend to repeat the visit in this facility. Or maybe that's the point, because the guests are here only once? This is not a place to which I will encourage my friends, nor am I going to come back here myself. Sad, but true."
5095,"The hotel, or rather a hotel complex, consists of the main building, several storeys and a few free-standing houses, forming a kind of open-air museum located on a slope. Down there is a lake with a muddy, neglected road leading to it. They got 'em a room in one of the cottages, something like a country cottage. The first impression after entering the room is an unpleasant smell, some musty smell, probably a consequence of omnipresent humidity. The room was large, spacious with a large bathroom of a good standard, but it lacked a few things that were standard four stars: no fridge, no air-conditioning (only a fan that does not give much and does not cool the room on hot days), no clothes hangers in the wardrobe and on the walls at the door, no safe, no satellite TV with good picture quality (there are a few channels, the picture is snowy not to watch). It's all a bit embarrassing, considering that the prices here are very high. In the room there are flies and mosquitoes flying and in the courtyard in front of the house you can stumble over apples that have fallen from the trees, which nobody cleans up. There is also no bench in front of the house where you can sit down in the evening. Generally, all this spoils the impression and underestimates the stay and it's a shame because the potential is. You just need to invest a little bit - the owner, whoever you are."
5096,"Today was my first visit. The behavior of your professor is specific. After today she felt a bit like an intruder. I will try to go to the next one and see if I will still have the same conviction. I'm not saying he's not a great professional. For the time being, it's still hard for me to say. I'm not a self-satisfied person but I'm just a patient. I have a right to ask. If I was a doctor of this specialty, there would be no problem. The visit was short and the effect is that ""I know that I don't know anything"". . ."
5097,"The wonderful doctor is very grateful for what he did. First I got to Sokołów Podlaski where the doctors gave me an MRI there it turned out that I have a very large hernia that presses on the spinal cord my right hand was getting inert. There it was stated that it is no longer possible to operate on it and I have to come to terms with it and in the near future I will be in a wheelchair (I am 23 years old). Thanks to my great happiness, I got to the hands of Dr. Paweł Wichrowski, who operated on me very quickly 4 hours after I started walking, nothing hurts me, the scar is almost invisible. I can only say that she could not have hit me in better hands. It is a doctor who works with the hands of God."
5098,My disease is glomerulonephritis in nephrotic syndrome. I went to see the Doctor directly after a 3 week stay in hospital. He wanted to consult both the recommended treatment and how to shape the daily diet. The doctor helped me to understand the mechanisms of this disease; he thoroughly discussed the conditions (good and bad sides) of the medicines that I have prescribed; as well as he indicated how to shape my diet in this disease. The visit broadened my horizons and strengthened my conviction that I can and will win with this disease. With all responsibility I recommend the doctor. Yours sincerely Grzegorz Rutkowski .
5099,"""Contrary to your intuition, walking through the forest, it is better to break through the bushes than to use the paths the animals walk on. There are seven times as many ticks on these paths as there are in the bushes! "" - remarks Dr. Krzysztof Dudek, who worked at the Institute of Zoology at the Poznań University of Life Sciences during the research. The only people who may be interested in encountering ticks are probably researchers of these parasites. The issue of where the largest concentrations of ticks exist in the landscape was addressed by a group of researchers from Poland and Slovakia: Pavel Jozef Šafárik University in Košice and Slovak Academy of Sciences in Košice, as well as from the Faculty of Biology of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan and the Institute of Zoology of Poznan University of Life Sciences. The results were presented in ""Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine"" ."
5100,A place worth recommending especially for those who like peace and quiet located far away from the center but nice forest surroundings minus the lack of mountain views rooms not large but clean service friendly but the boss herself could be a bit nicer food quite good enough and lacking finesse for example regional dishes
5101,"These are products in which tobacco is heated and not burned. In a traditional cigarette, the combustion process takes place at a temperature of about . 800 degrees Celsius, in the case of ""heat not burn"" technology (e.g. IQOS) the aerosol is produced by heating the tobacco to approx. 280 degrees. This produces potentially less harmful substances than traditional cigarettes. The research is conducted by the IQOS Institute of Experimental Biology. Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology. ""People have always smoked, today they smoke and will continue to smoke. If the Institute contributes to the choice of a less harmful form of smoking, it is worthwhile to conduct this research. We are not going to prove that cigarettes are not harmful,"" said prof. Joanna Szczepanowska from the Institute."
5102,"This hotel is a total failure. We got the keys to the room we were there maybe an hour and we had to change the room because we couldn't stand the noise from the street. The very nice receptionist changed our room right away. In the next room the remote control didn't work, the paddling pool was clogged, the stench from the sewer, dirty walls and curtains. After changing the room, I gave up because I was afraid to get worse. We were in the hotel for 2 nights and not once did anyone clean our room or change our towels even though they were lying on the floor. I called the reception desk and the nice receptionist said she was going to bring the towels, she did. When I was about to wash, I opened the towels that she had given us and they were bricked up. Towels with stains, holes, just disgusting. I let myself off the phone and went down to the reception desk alone, it was clear that the receptionist was exhausted with all the complaints and she wasn't surprised at all because it's not her fault, it's only the dear sir who can't handle this brothel. Breakfast is really bad, I've never eaten worse. The cleaners I met in the hallway on those days aren't very polite and don't look when somebody goes. I understand very busy because they did not have time to clean our room but to crouch in the hallway and sit on the phone it was time. Through the walls everything was hearing strange noises from the hallway as well as laughter and gossip of the cleaners. Tragedy. . . I'm not gonna say anything about shutting the door alarm and cutting it out. You could really write a lot about this ""outstanding"" hotel, but the worst thing I saw was a pawned-out emergency exit with a big truck with dirty rags on the lower floor right next to the conference rooms. I can see the safety of the guests above all. . Really embarrassing that the reception desk is overwhelmed and willing to help."
5103,"He also warned against tanning too much. ""Modern science knows that later skin cancers are particularly associated with sunburn in early childhood, childhood or preschool age,"" the expert said. That is why it is important to remember to use sunscreens (especially for the youngest) and not to stay in the sun too long. He added that elderly people also have very sensitive skin. On the other hand, in the case of bald people, the most exposed to sunlight is the scalp. ""There are very serious consequences of sunbathing, including skin cancers,"" he warned. Professor . Kardas reminds us of wearing headgear - straw hats, handkerchiefs, lilacs and even using umbrellas. This will avoid sunstroke and overheating, which may also result in, among other things, dizziness."
5104,"She could have chosen many of the shortcomings of this promise if it wasn't for the cold water in the extremes and the icy pool. But let's start at the beginning - read the reviews before you go somewhere. Completely unorganized at the check-in, which took bagatelle 1 . 5 hours . Then we got one of the rooms in the renovation, which was only replaced after the brawl. The rooms were cold and the smell of musty and mould was omnipresent in the corridors. In one of the rooms there was an unprotected electric socket. The doors to the balconies did not close, the carpet was stained. There was an extra heater in my room, so we didn't freeze. The elevator was getting jammed, bowling, too, so the carpet was broken down by the light. Dressing the Christmas tree so organized that there was no shortage of places for everyone. Santa Claus did not show up to give out presents. The rooms for 4 days of stay were not cleaned even once, not even nobody emptied the trash bins. The culmination was Christmas Eve, which overwhelmed the organizers (guests to eat something they did for the waiters themselves, there was no wafer, and at one of the tables sat a woman with a child, who was less defensive and if it was not for the kindness of other tables, they would have left Christmas Eve with a dry muzzle, there was a shortage of tableware, drinks, and many dishes from the menu of Christmas Eve did not see us in sight). As for the food on the other days it was a lot and very tasty. Christmas Eve dishes also (they have a good cook), but then there was total haos. It's a shame that the organization got so messed up, because when she talked to the people who were in this hotel, it wasn't the first time they said it was such a mess. In general, the atmosphere was very cool because the guests got very integrated through these problems. Most wrote complaints. The question is whether it will be taken into account. PS: This ""hotel"" has no stars, 4 appears on the page ""hotel"" is its logo. If they do not improve the logistics, they will not stay in the market, and it is a shame because this object has potential."
5105,"Terrible hotel, food every day the same, with dinner paid even water, hotel for not demanding, stinky and very dirty rooms."
5106,"I'm not happy, the visit was short and I had the impression that what she was saying to me was not getting to you. I was still saying that you have to rehabilitate yourself. exercise, go to the sanatorium and yet she said that I do everything and there is no effect and the pain in your spine is terrible. It was based on the description of RM and it had a plate as well. I am disappointed."
5107,"Strongly neutral . In OTC in a Merchant EVERY visit, despite the agreed time, is with a chute of at least 40 minutes. No one is able to inform you of this beforehand, nor to make major gaps between patients, so each time it blooms in the waiting room. Yes, the doctor devotes a lot of attention to the patient, it takes a lot of time for him to write down by hand any results, descriptions of the tests and write his own. Neutral due to the lack of ""substrate"" in the applied treatment. When she left the office she didn't know if the doctor prescribed me the medicine because I don't like the statement ""in some time we will see what comes out of it"" if she really has any idea for treatment. Only after the consultation in another place she was sure I was going in the right direction."
5108,"For the time being, only a certain range of activities that the consortium would like to address are known. ""We are talking about implementing a system of individualised medicine,"" says the director of IF PAS and explains that when standard methods of treatment are used, patients may react differently to them. For some, the therapy is effective and for others, it is not. Prof . Smoked explains that the patient's reaction to pharmacological factors is determined by the genetic background. Scientists are concerned with learning about this background and describing cases susceptible to typical therapies and atypical cases. ""Before prescribing a particular drug, an individual profile of susceptibility (of the patient - PAP) to particular drugs could be made. If we were equipped with individual profiles, we would be able to prescribe such drugs with great certainty, not other drugs"" - explains prof . Smoked . In this way the effectiveness of treatment could be improved. "" ( In Poland - PAP ) there are already a few centres which make such attempts. We would like to do it on a large scale and propose a new order in medicine as far as individual treatment is concerned"" - points out the director of IF PAS."
5109,"During the first visit she promised m that if the treatment works then I will build a monument to Mrs. Annie, but she said that enough comment so here it is: ) After a few months of wandering around the dermatologists, I finally found myself in someone who did not treat my illness (tears) as something incurable, on the contrary! She was focused on many tests and the worst, and here's a surprise! What kind of research, what for, is the ready treatment (already implemented during the visit!) and most importantly, there are already results! ! Contact with the doctor is great, even on facebook, quickly replies to the news: ) I strongly recommend to anyone who is struggling with the problem of hair loss and tears: ) the visit itself heals, because if you hear so many good words and even a guarantee that you will succeed, then it can only be better: )"
5110,"The lecture is interesting, the professor is ok, he speaks nice, he treats students like people and not like a mass. He often strayed from the subject, told jokes, talked to us. At colloquia, you can take off, although he walked around the room and talked, sometimes even took a piece of paper to read just like that. But generally a nice man, maybe because the lecture was ""mich a"
5111,"I highly recommend this hotel was in September. Rooms cleaned daily, to the beach 5min very close to stop to the beautiful city of Nessebar. Silence far from the busy street. Paradise for children's wading pool at the main swimming pool and separate children's care by animators in the playground. Eating good come monotony but still not to be eaten. Kantor in the hotel, gym even the hairdresser's Hotel very quiet big everyone will find something for themselves billiard ping pong. I recommend"
5112,"Hello , 1 , 5 years ago I had a nose operation - Cartilage and bone nose reconstruction with a shift of the wings of the nose at the base . I only wanted to get rid of the potato on the tip of my nose, the upper half of my nose was ok for me. She only wanted me to have a nice, shapely nose at the front as well as in profile [ now with profile nose long and pulled down like in a witch - with a macabre smile. Unfortunately, I regret now that, she has given up this operation to m . The potato as it was so it is so far [ she hoped it was swelling ] on the left side of my nose I have eternal rhinitis, and the upper left lip of the mouth is also slightly drooping, did the doctor violate my nerve? It's a pity. . . Dreams, money saved for a long time and hopes to get rid of the complex - she gained a silly joke and a knock on the head. I was very disappointed."
5113,"was on one and LAST visit to the Doctor. After entering, he ""measured"" me indifferently. I was on a private visit (not with emel med). I have never been so indifferently treated by the doctor before. Fortunately, she had the old tests from 2013 with her, because she didn't even quit to perform a thyroid ultrasound (it was an ophthalmologist's office!!!), she had the blood tests done, after seeing them she found out that they were ok . with the tsh 5 factor. 00 dropped me to 0 . 36 and Mr. Doctor claimed that it was very good. the only thing she got after 10 minutes was a note from a notebook on which it was written ""thyroid ultrasound"", so she paid 168 PLN for it! ! ! ! I have to go to an ultrasound in private and pay again. So why do we go to the doctors when they don't examine anymore? I advise against it !"
5114,"We bought our stay in OW Amadeus together with friends (3 families with small children) through the MYDEAL portal, but the conditions differed from what we were promised. The first and basic issue is the lack of cleaning the rooms during the whole stay, after entering the room bottles under the bed from the previous stay, for the whole 3 days not disposed of rubbish (we were with a small child - dirty pampers ' were ' together with us in the room for 3 days). . . .toilet paper supplemented after intervention at the reception. For the welcome we were supposed to receive a bottle of wine, which we received, but goodbye on the last day of our stay also after the intervention at the reception. Another matter is the use of the SPA, which we also had guaranteed in the package. Probably Mrs. Beata from the reception desk (black hair, stocky physique) tried to convince us that there are no vacancies for the Jacuzzi, which was a nonsense because the day before - in the evening another lady from the reception desk informed us that there are vacancies from 10 to 15. I would like to point out that there were only a few people in the resort so there was no possibility to fill all the places. Moreover, we were staying in the playroom next to the SPA from 10 o'clock. 15 and the lady told us that from 10 o'clock she had 2 sessions, but nothing like that happened because the jacuzzi was locked and there was nobody inside. When I asked why we could not take advantage of the offer from 10 . If it was free, the lady answered that the water is cold (how is it possible if there were 2 sessions before, apparently) and that after 2 sessions the water must be cleaned! When we wanted to sign up for a later time, you answered that from 17 to 22 you are busy (so I don't understand how it feels that after two 20 sessions the water has to be cleaned for a minute and in the afternoon you can use it for 5 hours without a break? ) . Other ladies receptionists are very helpful and nice. Breakfast is tasty and varied."
5116,"As he says, our little tenants help us to digest e.g. fat, protein, fibre or sugars. He adds that substances secreted by bacteria can e.g. change the action of e.g. digestive enzymes or bile, and it is very important in absorbing fats or vitamins contained in them. The set of genes of our small tenants (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites) are microbial. It is easy enough for a microbiome to be examined by analyzing a faecal sample and sequencing the genes contained therein. Each of us has a slightly different microbiome that works a little differently. This, among other things, makes it easy for some people to gain weight in addition to our own genes, and for others to make concessions in their diet."
5117,"Very courteous and forgiving service. The cleanliness of the facility is maintained in an exemplary manner . Very good kitchen ( food is heaven in the mouth ) . Location of the object very good - quiet place, away from the road and at the same time close to the center. I liked the most the massages (their excellent way of performing) and the pleasant atmosphere. The least - very chlorinated water in the pool. ""The small architecture requires some refinement. A big advantage is the possibility to stay with animals. I recommend visiting the beautiful city of Jelenia Góra!"
5119,"I don't agree with the last opinion. The doctor will always listen to the patient, he will advise and comfort when needed. He diagnosed me with the disease very quickly, the diagnosis was later confirmed by a specialist doctor. My family can always count on the help of the doctor and we have never been disappointed yet. I recommend the Doctor as much as possible."
5121,"The doctor makes a good impression during her first visits, which unfortunately passes with time. . . Errors in prescriptions (definitely too many / too few pills), problems with prescriptions in pharmacies (because the wrong dose was entered and the pharmacist could not spend a given number of packages) . This did not happen to other doctors at all! During later meetings the interview is collected residually (meeting max. 20 - 25 minutes) and is practically based on the therapist's records (not on the patient's relationship with the well-being and effect of drugs). The doctor has a lot to improve in her practice. I recommend choosing another doctor!"
5122,"I consider Dr. Sosnowski to be a doctor worthy of recommendation. Unfortunately, I was with him only on three visits, because the pregnancy turned out to be dead, but he behaved as he should - immediate referral to the hospital and words of encouragement, which encouraged me a lot. I will definitely decide on him at the next pregnancy."
5123,"My husband and I were planning to spend the weekend there buying an offer from Groupon. Right after the purchase she looked at the following reviews so we started to be skeptical about the stay. On the other hand, she thought to herself that maybe all of these reviews are just from the people who are so tedious. None of these things, going there, having low expectations I have to admit that such a nativity scene never worked m . We were supposed to spend two nights at the hotel, there were already dozens of people waiting at the reception, for whom there was simply no room! ! ! ! hotel (I'm not sure if this object can be called that) has no reservation system, reservations are written down on cards, and someone from the staff apparently lost a few cards, or maybe the people who took reservations, do not work there for a long time. I think that we didn't accidentally find ourselves in such a situation, only that such scenes happen every now and then. Fortunately, we were given accommodation in a nearby Kur Hotel and decided to stay there until the end. We lost our spa package and many other ""attractions"". but the conditions there are disgusting. I think somebody should send the Sanitary Service, Uokik and all possible institutions because the hotel is an insult to the hotel industry and a complete mockery of the client. Instead of buying groupon/grouper in this hotel, I recommend checking out other hotels that are the same price, or not much more expensive! ! ! and will save you unnecessary nerves and disappointments."
5124,"I'm not a demanding person. I also travel a lot with children. We often stay in 3 star rooms, but this hotel has disappointed us a lot. Perhaps the main building is different and we were accommodated in one of the additional buildings at the back of the hotel. The rooms are as clean as possible. The furniture is scratched, the bathroom door is overgrown with mould. A very small shower. Place in the bathroom covered with a curtain - do not turn around if you do not want to stick to it . The glass shelf hanging above the washbasin is tilted at an angle so that you will not put anything there because everything is going to come off. You keep your cosmetics in the room because nothing else will fit there. The family room is made up of two bedrooms separated by a door, but only one has an air conditioner. In the part without it, in the heat, you can not stand it. The air conditioner itself worked flawlessly except for the external unit which made the sound of a take-off plane. If you want to cool down the room before bedtime, you will not sit on the balcony and still you will only cool down one of them because nothing will get to another. The kitchen has a fridge and that's a plus, but also wandering food ants. When we happen to leave anything to eat on the counter. You had the impression that everything would come out on its own. Deep pool cleaned daily, no war over sunbeds. Breakfast, well, poor choice and poor quality all under English tourists. Eternal queues to the toaster, waiting for cups, plates and pieces. The constantly spoiled drinks machine. It overheated and had to wait for it to cool down. Very nice ladies serving, but they only two and the accumulation for breakfast from 9 - 10 so they barely made up. We spent all day long outside the hotel, but when he came in the evening, he did not want to go back there. They asked us to change the room, but we heard that there was no chance because the occupancy was full. The distance from the sea is over a kilometer. The beach was taken over by guests selling sun loungers 4 euros a day for one sunbed . When you want to lie on a towel you have a tiny piece of beach left. Generally a disappointment ."
5125,"We had accommodation between 4 and 5 pm. When we arrived at the owner's place there was no . We talked to a sauna worker, who does not have the keys to the rooms. He gave us the number to the owner, who wanted us to wait 30 minutes. It was a shame. They gave us up and we went somewhere else where we could easily find a place to stay."
5126,generally a large hotel plus daily rooms with beautiful views of the mountains food a little bit monotonous but very tasty swimming pools and slides is a very large plus of this hotel cool daily animations and mini disco for children I recommend for families with children
5127,"Your old date, so don't expect fireworks in your lectures. He's rewriting the script on the board. It requires absolute silence, I have absolute hearing and absolute sight, it will hear and see everything. And he remembers who, where, where, when he sat and when he wasn't there. He likes it when you come to her to consult with her tasks and in general, when he associates someone with his face and name it is milder for this person. Colloquia is rather simple, elementary tasks, it is enough to know the patterns, in addition to the tasks practically from the script, only changes the numbers (loves these books)."
5128,"The doctor is nice, she has gastrological knowledge but this is not enough to help a person with irritable bowel syndrome. 3 visits didn't give anything, wasted my time, resources and tired me unnecessarily. The doctor referred me to the examination, to which I can't give a discharge, to full happiness the patient finds out about it after the examination is already arranged and he started the diet. I recommend the doctor in general matters, but in the matter of ZJD I recommend looking for a doctor with experience of leading and treating such ailments."
5129,"Mr. Lewandowski, not only that he pulled a lot of money out of me, but he also talked about a serious disease, which, as it turned out, after the examination with other doctors, I do not have. When she was sitting in the gynecological chair, that is in the situation of my helplessness, he informed me that just in case he would download materials for the next examinations, he did not mention their high price. I think that the test results could also be falsified. I am very disappointed, for more than half a year she lived with the conviction that her life was in danger and she trusted Mr. Lewandowski as a doctor. I strongly advise against it."
5130,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. A nice room, large comfortable bed, flat screen TV, individual air conditioning. Bathroom is clean, everything is supplemented, towels and cosmetics. For greeting water in the room and a set of tea and coffee. There was no problem with finding a reservation. The reception desk helped, explained everything and at our request booked an ironing kit. Breakfast is very good! ! ! You can choose from flakes, yoghurts, fresh peeled fruits, cheeses, cold cuts, vegetables, hot scrambled eggs, sausages, sausages. . . Anything you want for breakfast. In addition, 2 vending machines with coffee and tea and fresh bread and sweet buns. The trip was a success and you wanted to go back to the hotel. We did not use the gym and sauna but it is included in the price. When we are in Warsaw, it is only here."
5131,"She was on so-called . . . weight loss holidays and never again . Food without taste . I understand that the diet is governed by its own laws, but the use of herbs is probably acceptable? The hotel offers catering options for vegetarians. Unfortunately, the chef/dietician probably thinks it involves eating only Greek salads and porridge for breakfast. However, the worst thing was when I took the pillowcase off the pillowcase. The pillowcase was all yellow in streaks. I'm afraid to think what caused it. Fortunately, I had my tourist pillow and somehow survived. The activities are super off the sticks, which are carried out in the forests where you can find worn out hygienic pads etc. attractions. The sea - wonderful, morning start, aqua fitness and classes in the hall - super . The rest is hopeless . I will certainly not return here"
5132,"We were in the hotel as wedding guests one great drama, we came a little earlier the room was not ready although we reported the fact. On the second day we couldn't stay until the beginning of the corrections practically we were thrown out of the room. In the corridor it was dark as in d . . . . e , small rooms collapsed with furniture could not be passed through freely. Breakfast was terrible, no choice, dry bread, undercooked eggs. I do not recommend to anyone."
5133,"I recommend Dr. Szymula, he has been my doctor for 23 years, he has been leading my two pregnancies and receiving births, he is always professional and reliable. He is characterized by great patience, he is nice and always has time for the patient to explain her problem. So many years of trust in the doctor probably proves something."
5134,"I'll start with the fact that there are two large cowsheds in the area (across the street), which give the rural atmosphere of the area: ) My room is the standard of middle-class dormitories, but it is suitable for one quick night's sleep. There was no problem with an extra bed for a child. Very cozy lobby with comfortable armchairs, fireplace and billiards. Food - tasty standard continental breakfast, in the Lobby-Bar excellent chef's dish at a reasonable price. Swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi - at 5 +"
5136,"We were surprised when we arrived that we got the key to the room occupied by the front guest. Then - the TV wasn't working, but the friendly staff replaced it. . Compared to previous stays, I regret to say that the food is broken - it is a lot but uniform and often repeats what was the previous day at dinner. For this reason my husband got sick and as we found out it was not an isolated case."
5137,"We've just come back from the "" rest "" at the "" Hotel "" Manor. The access road is a nightmare . The miracle that the car has not lost its suspension, a hole in the hole. The only thing left of the trip is the omnipresent smell of moisture. All the clothes stink of fungus. Worse, it stinks all over the body. The unpleasant smell can be felt already entering the object. The staff try to kill the smell of the fungus by burning a bonfire in the evening hours, which in combination with musty smell creates a deadly mixture. Breakfast could still be accepted, while dinner was disgusting. We came and went hungry. For 2 days salt in different forms was served. The ""salad"" they call a chopped leek with onions. The ""baked potatoes"" are in fact raw plates sprinkled with pizza spice. Water and compote and coffee from nearby sewage. For 3 days the dough was the same and smelled like a fridge. Relaxation zone is a mushroom zone. Stinking bowling alley with no working track, massacred gym (torn treadmill). But the worst was in the ping-pong room. The smell resembled a men's locker room after intensive training. The smell was unbearable. The place has very high potential, very poorly used. We do not recommend it to anyone, for sure we will never go back there!"
5138,"I recommend that you do not get too upset about asking strange questions, but always give you time to think about it (consultation with others :)) and go to the table next to a little bit of confusion is because you do not always know what to do not always everything works and then you are thinking because it does not work too well, but with credit there is no problem you give the protocol or if he tells you you are doing things at home."
5139,"Interestingly, in Krakow's hostels in these holidays the prices for accommodation in double rooms were higher than in 3 * hotels. For example, in the cult hostel Good By Lenin a room cost 150 - 160 zloty with breakfast and in the hotel Best Western Galicya you could buy it on booking.com for 124 zloty. And an air-conditioned room in a 4 * Swing hotel cost 200 zloty. And in the hostel there were no free rooms and in the hotels - yes . What makes customers pay such prices for a low, hostel standard? Location of hostels in the city center and the atmosphere in them. On the occasion of the study, the Institute of Hospitality also established TOP 10 of the interests of foreigners - hostel customers. Here is in order of frequency, what they ask about: 1 ."
5140,"I have a discoloration under my eyes, the doctor informed me that it is difficult to remove it generally recommend that if nothing can be done then what more can be expected, she wanted me to have a doctor show more interest in my problem and even though he looked at the discoloration he evaluated it up close. Discolouration can also be a symptom of the disease. It is difficult to judge generally I would give a positive assessment. Thank you very much"
5141,"Hello, I was persuaded by a friend of the owner of a car parts store. Futura died after 2 years. After reporting the warranty, ok I got a new one. I was satisfied, but it has the joy of lasting 2 months this time. The situation is the same as with the previous pseudo battery. The car does not drive for two days (weekend) and discharged . So again the warranty in hand and to the store . This time it was not so funny. The warranty is not recognized, the reason is the voltage consumption of my car. A friend of the shopkeeper admits to the center. It's hard, I bought a new U.S. Crown out of a friend's house and the furry centres will drive from me to the service and back through the shopkeeper's hands of course. The battery is almost new, so 3 years will go by but to the service and with . I have time ; )"
5143,"I was just about to get a good look at the equipment. After a short time the screen started blinking, which is repeated quite often. Several times it happened that after starting up the system there were no icons, it only helped to restart it. The manufacturer's website - tragedy! Some of the information is not translated into Polish, to find the phone number of a competent person you have to click - and you will not succeed anyway! The equipment came back from the service (German) completely unrepaired - they only performed a load test, which did not detect anything. The defect was not detected and removed. The service department wrote only that the equipment works according to the manufacturer's guidelines. That's why I don't recommend this equipment, because whoever likes it to blink the screen every few minutes. And I still have to fight with the manufacturer or the seller. . ."
5144,"My dear all of course depends on the attitude my trip was successful but only because of the team and sightseeing outside the hotel and I'm not talking about santa suzanna because she is small although very charming The hotel has left a disgusting taste Fee for drinks to lunch and dinner Adding chlorine to the pool, Jacuzzi with a carnival so to the eye while people enjoy it No entertainment at all and what funny music at the pool No nice service except for one only waitress named Marija The service knows poorly English pity. . . Spa or rather its lack of massage places as it later turned out lack of massage therapistsHarmful because the hotel has super predispositions"
5146,Professor W . Mulak Analytical Chemistry I - lecture [ / b ] under Itarilde's opinion I can only sign - nothing to add : )
5148,"It's my first trip to the sanatorium and I guess it couldn't get any worse. Pavilion B is a terrible old, long or even very long time ago not renovated. Scratched windows overlook the street, the noise of the cars doesn't let you sleep. Horrible small TV sets with five programs for which you have to pay 80 PLN lack of towels, you can of course rent them for an additional fee for changing bed linen you have to pay. For treatments you have to go to another building. The food is terrible. The diet is very often white cooked pasta for dinner. Eggs from ""Ladybirds"" and potato salad from lunch on the agenda. In the canteen, almost military rigour: the door opens punctually at the hour, the dishes are brought in, and the chairs are almost mandatory. Consultation with a specialist after a week's stay is definitely too late, in general I decide for myself which treatments I want because the doctor is quite specific to say the least. To sum up, this is a terrible place and I honestly do not recommend it."
5149,"This hotel / studio is an ideal place to go to Rotterdam. It is located right next to Bijenkorf and close to all shops. Here I really felt like home. You can cook and the bed is amazing. Slept 'em like babies. When it comes to the view, it's amazing. There were 'em on the 8th floor and we had a view of the city. Keep in mind that there is no reception around the clock, so if you want a direct answer to your questions ask before 5:00. But what more do you need? This place is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who would visit Rotterdam."
5150,"The prices have reached Ilawa but not the quality of service. The hotel managers have probably never been in a five-star hotel. Service at the level of a mediocre three-star hotel. The staff manager was unable to answer the basic questions. Faulty windows and loud air conditioning . Inconvenient mattresses . Dirty pool flooring . Total lack of help with luggage handling . Arrogant behaviour of the basic staff (no bathrobe in the pool, not working locks in the pool cabinets, bill served without an envelope - asking for a T-shirt or envelope caused ironic smiles) . Good food. Summary - the level of service as in a three-star hotel can not count on anything else: ("

5152,"Parking a small strangely organized general disorder but fortunately somehow managed to find a place each time ( ufff ) . For a good day porter not very sympathetic but professional ( maybe such a beauty ) . We paid for the stay right away ( he didn't find it strange only in other opinions I read that strange ( strange : - / ) . The room is nice but not entirely clean ( it is better not to look under the bed ) . In the bathroom the key was not working, but after reporting it to the porter's office, it was repaired, so it's okay. The swimming pool part was not big but surprisingly was not very popular, even the yakuzas managed to use (in winter it could be worse). The look of the rooms in the pool area for me bubble, some good decorator had to dip fingers in it. The food is delicious (I can only rate breakfast), big choice. In general, I rate the stay as a plus."
5153,"Hello, I'm a nineteen-year-old girl, another patient of Dr. Gryglewski. In February this year, on the last balance sheet, the family doctor felt a tumor on my neck. She got a referral for an ultrasound, which, as it turned out later, was misdescribed and had to do it again. The doctors told me that the tumor was already calcified and it was not cancer. After the biopsy, however, it turned out that I had suspected thyroid cancer. Dr. Gryglewski reacted immediately and the surgery had to be done about a week after receiving the results. My left thyroid lobe was removed. After two weeks, she got the result of the histopathological examination and found out that she had already been enrolled to the doctor. The result showed thyroid cancer. A few days later she had another operation and my right thyroid lobe and lymph nodes were removed from my neck. It was only when I received my second discharge from the hospital that I found out what she had actually experienced m . The card clearly stated ""malignant thyroid cancer"". After receiving the second histopathological examination, a stone fell from my heart. It turned out that there were no metastases. Now I have an endocrine consultation to find out if I have to have radiation therapy. The whole history of my disease went very quickly. The surgeries didn't turn out to be as terrible as it seems. All this time I was in good spirits. The first and second surgery was good for me. I'm a young person and she thought I wasn't affected by this kind of disease, and yet. I really encourage everyone to have regular check-ups and treatment myself. I am and always will be very grateful to Dr. Gryglewski for his quick reaction and help."
5154,"The neighborhood is very nice and also very well maintainedThe appearance of the restaurant inside and outside very nice Dinner - fatalDeser ( cakes ) - may beSpeed of service - poor service courtesy - good . The area itself is a great place for a walk and possibly for a cake. Dinner dishes are definitely not recommended. The broth was practically dark from the amount of Maggi and tasted as it looked. When it comes to sour soup in bread, bread was the best. The amount of sour soup was very small, the taste was weak but it was difficult to taste it at all because you could feel only pieces of sausage of a quality that is better not to mention. The pork chop with chips is better a bit better than soups but without revelation. The number of miseries for the lunch set - no words, I'm sorry I didn't take a picture of 'em but I didn't have a good lens to summarize, a great place for a walk and possibly a cake. For lunch, unfortunately, I do not recommend"
5155,"After the holidays in December, we went to Będzin to consult on the removal of III almond. We were accepted without any problems, the visit went smoothly, the examination also. The doctor is a NORMAL person, at the visit we talked about the state of health of the child, about the procedure, explained everything, wrote everything to us and showed willingness to cooperate in case of any questions after the visit. I consider the stay in the hospital in Bytom under the wings of the doctor as positive. The care of children really has nothing to attach to, Mr. Nurses all nice and polite, sincerely to help. The most important thing is that the treatment went well, after the treatment is much better. The follow-up visit went smoothly and we see you with the doctor in six months. I SINCERELY RECOMMEND! ! !"
5156,"It was a wedding anniversary trip. The staff was up to the task. Beautiful suite, dinner at the restaurant delicious, rose petals and live music. In addition, a place with a wonderful view of the illuminated castle. The location is great, leaving the hotel directly on the promenade on the Vistula. Clean, parking and smiling staff are available."
5157,"Dr. Dr. is a recommended dentist. He should heal thoroughly and carefully. Her fillings stick to the patient for a long time (she uses good materials) and she is very careful to finish them, trying to give them a good shape so that I can trust her, and the queues of people under the surgery show that I don't only have them. She has a great anesthetic to the teeth so that you don't feel any pain during the mud. She gives advice on oral hygiene, as well as to young mothers who want to take care of their little ones from the first months of their lives. It's worth adding that it's also a touch. After experience with other dentists, I decided to go only to it."
5158,"I personally recommend treatment with the Doctor. I didn't have my teeth curved terribly, at least in my opinion, but for therapeutic reasons I just had to put on braces. These causes are a bad occlusion and therefore excessive tooth abrasion, which in the future could end up simply by clashing healthy teeth. Now I am after the treatment and the teeth are really Hollywood: ) I hear a lot of compliments that I have really nice teeth even from people that I just met. Now the teeth are definitely one of my biggest advantages. Of course it wasn't easy. The braces have been wearing m for over 2 years. Visits every 4-6 weeks, sometimes quite painful in consequences, so you have to reckon with money and that it can be unpleasant. But it was worth it. The doctor herself is experienced, you can see that she has a lot of knowledge. She knows what she does. Maybe she's not dripping with icing on her patients, but she's also not unpleasant. She's just a woman doing her job, I think that's the point. She's a professional for me."
5159,"The first contact with this hotel, which did not want to give a 1% discount was not encouraging. Weekend price and the end . However, the whole stay was a band of positive impressions. What are the impressions that make me give the highest rating? 1 . I eat differently than 95% of people and usually in hotels I have nothing to eat Although it is very simple food, the kitchen somehow has this problem. This was the first hotel that prepared for me exactly what I asked em to do. Just: raw vegetables and canned beans. 2 . Every day, I changed the towels, cleaned the room and tidied up things that didn't necessarily lie nice: ) 3 . Espresso in an hour after breakfast for Free ? No problem ! 4 . Fruit bowl available at your fingertips ? Absolutely ! 5 . Instead of coffee cocoa ? Here you go. 6 . Late departure and the possibility of staying four hours longer in the room ? No problem ! 7 . Wifi , it's really wifi , not a pseudo link with no bandwidth . Super speed, no suspension. Bravo! Apart from that, cleanliness, interesting interior design, calm and very polite service. The hotel's a bit out of the way, but if anyone has a need, Lidl shop 400 meters away. Recommended!"
5160,A hotel is a good idea to stay overnight before travelling e.g. to Vilnius or Riga. Tallinn . we used to stay overnight for 4 days 2os.plus 2 children . Plus a fairly good breakfast . Cake is missing. The rest are as good as in a hotel. Not like in a Masurian guesthouse or a habitat with regional products. A business hotel rather than a guesthouse. A good brand in the winter capital of Poland . I do not know how lunches . Nice service at the reception . Possibility to use jacuzzi and fitness club . Quite a good hotel .
5161,"The choice of this doctor was made after reading many positive opinions about him, but in my opinion they are not adequate to reality. The doctor is not a very nice and contactable doctor. He may be a good specialist, but after visiting him I wasn't calmed down, I wasn't recommended a special diet that would help me with the medication in my ailments. In addition, when I was with another gastroenterologist, I found out that IgG blood tests for Helicobacter (which Dr. Tyszkiwski recommended to do) are meaningless because Helicobacter pylori is tested in faeces or by a urease test. I also did not get a printout of the ultrasound that was allegedly done and for which I had to pay."
5163,"A trip with friends to the MARINA CLUB a successful place Charming and beautifully situated Food very good As for the service: already at the check-in the receptionist treated us coolly then the waiter for dinner also came out poorly but after that the service was nice and always smiling, the waitress Mrs. Joanna deserves special attention who approaches her work very professionally and with dedication Room: generally very comfortable clean and pleasant except for : not working kettle dripping tap it was known that we would be with the child and did not prepare the cot The most was em unpleasantly surprised by the lack of possibility to buy options with full board , I bought 'em a breakfast and dinner option and on the spot it turned out that dinner was free but with a limit - funny Breakfast correct Cold water in the pool When I went to the Marina I was counting on 'em to taste it * * * * * * * * * * * But overall the place is beautiful and we'll definitely go back to the Marina Club"
5164,"Some time ago I was at a consultation, on the basis of which I decided that I will NOT undergo surgery with Dr Jarlinski. When I had an appointment for a particular hour, she approached the reception. You were more interested in a private telephone conversation than in directing me to the doctor. She was waiting for an additional half an hour, although I had an appointment for a specific one. When I finally managed to get into the office, the doctor was just getting ready to leave saying that he had to go somewhere and he would be there in 20 minutes. What am I supposed to do, that if he comes out now, I'll come out with him and I won't be back. The consultation was about breast enlargement. (she was m on two other consultations and this one was the worst.) The doctor was poorly interested in explaining the contraindications, complications after the procedure - he was not interested in the conversation at all. Having plans to spend 14 thousand zlotys, she expected me to be more involved. At the end she found out that I will not get a computer printout of the selection of implants, because it is impossible to print it. She paid me more for the use of this program than for consultations with other doctors. A few weeks later, she received a phone call from the clinic informing me that I have a date booked and that I need to make an advance payment, although she did not book any date. I am disgusted and disappointed with the level of service provided by the most recommended surgeon in Wroclaw."

Bed linen dressed in pillowcases from the deep Polish People's Republic, you can't count the mishaps, add a stink yet. For breakfast, a whole week of pancakes with jam, steam or sausage, cottage cheese in 2 - 3 kinds, cheese, the cheapest cold meat, coffee next to coffee did not stand, without taste and smell. Dinners with squalor plus lack of taste, a nightmare of some Russell. Once they gave me a underfried ground, potatoes undercooked every day. BleeeeeNever everI do not recommend to you, 1 - neck and the last time, for this money is not worth it, a tragic resort. The trip was compensated for by the weather, the beach every day, up to 200m."
5166,"Organization - through this pefective portal . Several reminders, and on the day of the visit sms and phone call confirming the time of the visit. = super . Mr. Doctor is trying very hard, but close to his surroundings; the environment - colleagues - support staff leaves a lot to be desired. The reception desk - the radio plays so loudly that it is difficult to hear what the receptionist says (hearing I have dory). He drew attention to 'em, then he heard 'em, that's not loud at all. In the people's waiting room as in the NFZ reception. ( Loudly, - the people and accompanying people are talking on the phone ) Nobody reacts to it. The records for a specific hour and you wait 50 minutes. Patients from outside the queue enter the doctor. Then the doctor hurries. . . . . . i . . . . . . . . .is nervous. . . ."
5167,"He was traveling to the castle with his partner. They checked in at the hotel exactly on 19 January 2018 in the afternoon. I work at the hotel myself and I know how important the first impression is. You greeted us? When my partner gave his name, the receptionist looked at us and said, ""But there is a double bed in this room. With such a huge lack of professionalism he has never met em before. Only because of my partner kept 'em calm and didn't teach 'em the manners of that receptionist, who with all due respect to the board should never have sat behind that desk. It was this very moment that made my partner not enjoy the trip as if I wanted to. I didn't think em that in a hotel as reputable as the Mercure Hotel you could come across such a lack of tact. I'll definitely never go back there."
5168,"Hello, I recommend Dr. Ziółkowska to anyone struggling with laryngological problems. Not only the large ones but also the small ones. The doctor removed my son's third tonsil, earlier the child had been treated by two other doctors but without success. Here, the doctor knew how to deal with us (especially with the child) and how to remedy it, she is a very kind person and probably always satisfied with life. My friend, whose child is also awaiting treatment, has already taken professional advice. Children with the doctor are not stressed so the parents approach the matter differently, I on the day of the procedure hearing the voice of Mrs. Magda always calmed me down 90 percent. I recommend it with all my heart."

5171,"It was my first and business visit to the Novotel . Very quick check-in (internet), the kind lady at the reception desk took care of everything literally in a flash. Checking out as fast as checking in. The hotel is clean and well maintained. The rooms are of high standard, everything is prepared for a flash. The room is equipped with a large number of towels, handy cosmetics and a large selection of sleeping pillows (which is a pleasant surprise). Buffet breakfast, very good quality and fresh products, nice and polite staff. I recommend it and I will definitely use it again. However, to make it not so colourful, quite a loud hairdryer which woke up half of the hotel probably: )"
5172,"She planned a trip to the Sand Hotel to celebrate my fiancé's birthday. We were greeted nicely from the very entrance to the hotel. Employees are doing their job perfectly. The room is very comfortable, cozy and clean. In the evening, we were guests in the restaurant, the waiter recommended us a very good dish. The meal met our expectations as well as the restaurant staff. There is also a cozy sauna. In the morning we had a very good breakfast. Hotel on a high level with nice service and a room where you can really relax. We will certainly still visit this hotel. We highly recommend this place . Kasia and Michael ."
5173,"The hotel is well located. . . 10 min . walk from the Market Square towards the entrances to the : Three Crosses Hill, Castle and Tower. Spacious rooms with nice bathrooms. Breakfast is delicious except for coffee from the machine. You need to devote a few zlotys to buy a professionally made coffee. Restaurant open till late evening offers 20% discount for hotel guests. Nice service . Parking lot of considerable size . Wi - fi good quality . Children's play area on the first floor ."
5174,"She used the services of many dermatologists, but it was only Dr. Rzepnikowski who advised me what treatment will help in the problem of falling out hair. I have been treating my thyroid for years and my hair is very weak. After performing the appropriate examinations ordered by the Doctor, I was recommended to use carbon dioxide carboxytherapy and my plasma. I am after 4 treatments. My hair slowly stops falling out. I can't wait for further results. There is no need to hide the painful treatment, but it is worth it! ! The doctor effectively distracts attention from the pain! I recommend Fabskin"
5175,"They bought us a weekend 2. 11 - 04 . 11 . 2012 - we stayed only for one night and only because we bought bedding in Olsztyn. This hotel was dirty and stinky. Maybe because the hotel is damp. A fungus on the wall is normal. We found the room cold, unprepared, with a buried bed. There was no hot water. The staircases were unheated - we had to use them because of the lift failure. The pool was cold and dirty. The food was monotonous, tasteless, cold, served on dirty tablecloths and dishes. Children's playroom with toys sticking to the dirt! Unpleasant, incompetent service. I advise against visiting the Manor Hotel!"
5176,"In a hotel that advertises itself as a spa there are no basic treatments, there was only a masseur. The staff declared that all appointments for 3 days of my stay are booked, but we were almost the only guests in the hotel and did not see me or any outside person. The decoration is very business and conference style and does not fit in with the historic building and surroundings. The service is all the same and nothing is possible. . . The hotel is badly managed, so despite the beautiful location and nice swimming pool I do not go and do not recommend it. In the SPA category you don't wash up to the competition. . . . Maybe it is suitable as a background for a wedding. ."

5181,"She also operated on her bust at Dr Kulicki's in the Clinic in Żoliborz. With the effect I am very pleased, I have large firm breasts. A great professional, before the surgery, told me about all possible methods of breast enlargement, the consequences and possible complications. You can see that the doctor has a lot of knowledge, he knows all the latest trends and really knows what he does. If someone is thinking about bust augmentation surgery I absolutely encourage and especially with Dr. Kulicki."
5182,"The thermometer was bought by us a few weeks ago. We are satisfied with it so far and can recommend it with a clear conscience. We tested the thermometer on 3 people. The results are repeatable - the deviation is about 0 , 1 - 0 , 2 degrees. The measurement takes a few seconds (during this time the thermometer should be moved 2 - 3 cm from the front). A very useful function is the ability to measure the temperature of the environment and objects . Thanks to that it is possible e.g. to check if the water in the bath tub has already the right temperature to start bathing the bean. It is worth to invest in a decent thermometer and be sure that the measurement results are correct. I recommend ."
5183,"We've been in this place once. Unfortunately, there are many things that should be improved and this is not the case. Where to start . Coffee for breakfast is a total dishwater. In this class of facility for breakfast there should be normal coffee machines and not some kind of heater. As soon as a few people left the hotel the temperature in the pools was lowered. I'm here with the children for them and it's just cold here. The staff lie that he has a problem but two days earlier everything is ok and at the weekend it's miraculously getting warm again. You pay the price and you have this level of service. Eating ok . Plenty and good, pizza in the restaurant at 5+. The worst part is that the sandra creates packages for different periods of the year. The problem is that you can't take advantage of the normal offer at this time of year. How can it be that you can not take advantage of a permanent offer, the more so that it is more advantageous than SUPER promotions prepared by the company . A promotion should encourage purchase and not scare off . And that's how it is . They are probably too good with German and Swedish patients and they don't care about changes and offer for Poles ."
5184,"Attention! I warn you about a fraudulent hotel. We reach Szklarska and are redirected to another address. The distance from the slope to Szrenica differs 6x ! The quality of the hotel is also different. There is so much dust in the rooms that at night I have asthma attacks which I do not suffer from. Trampled potatoes under the bed is such a detail. Unfortunately, the pictures do not smell "" smell "" . You can judge for yourself."
5185,"She got to the doctor's office by accident in 36 weeks and I advise against it. Before that she had three ultrasounds performed in another place, where for 100 PLN there were great conditions to perform an ultrasound examination (5 photos, precise explanation of what is happening with the baby, everything she saw in front of me on a separate screen, screen, etc.). ) . Unfortunately this was not the case with Dr Kunert. . . 120 PLN for examination without photos . . . . .she didn't see me exactly what he was showing because only he had the monitor, set up at an angle, so it was hard to see anything. Since I'm paying, I'm demanding. I won't go there anymore. This time she had to, because there was no time off at the other, checked place."
5186,"The service is clearly not aimed at random people coming to relax at the weekend . They are interested in quantity and quality. They booked us a package that spa, massage and miraculous spa itself, relaxed us completely. It's a shame it was only worse afterwards, dinner, at first nobody knew what to give us. Then came the lady who offered us the boss menu. Two groups in the area had parties, smelled like barbecue and good food, while we got some defrosted leftovers, worse than in the worst milk bar. Only one waitress tried to save the situation. Thank you very much, the rest of the staff was busy taking care of themselves, setting up the TV for the game and personal matters. We were waiting for food about 1 hour and we didn't have a chance to go to the pool because 20 minutes after waiting for dinner it didn't really pay off. Anyway, despite the request, we did not get our bathrobes. The hotel denied our request for a double bed and glasses to the room. I did not meet with such an approach either in Poland or in the world."
5187,"No more Saeco. Everything is beautiful until something breaks down. They bought us this company's machine, which worked for a few short months after which it stopped grinding coffee. After a complaint was lodged, we found out that we poured water into the mill (!!!!) As it turns out, it is a common practice of Saeco services. . . Making coffee creates steam that condenses into the grinder, but saeco service technicians tell customers that they are not smart enough and pour water not where it is needed. . The adventure with the repair of the super miraculous machine cost us 173,74 PLN, of which 110,7 PLN is the working time of the service men."
5188,"Suggesting opinions on the portal, a well-known doctor decided to use the advice of the Doctor (indications for a visit from a POZ doctor), unfortunately, I am very disappointed, but it is very disappointing after the visit. I was not examined, the visit lasted very shortly and did not contribute anything to the process of further treatment (fortunately, she found me a second specialist rheumatologist, who took my problem seriously). It is difficult for me to assess the expertise or knowledge of the doctor, for the reasons mentioned above, but I must stress the lack of professionalism and empathy. To sum up: the second time she would not have taken my advice and would not have recommended me to anyone."
5190,"When a friend recommended me to Mrs. Karolina, he was sceptical about the idea of ""another time, it probably won't work anyway"". And here. . . . Surprise. Mrs. Caroline was the first and I had already had several approaches, she made me realize that diet is not just ""husband"" . ! ! . She showed me how to eat less, but to feel fulfilled in the culinary sense and see the effect of her work. Of course the positive effect. Weight down ! Professional approach of Mrs. Caroline makes you want . A little self-denial and brick effect . I strongly recommend it, even to those who have already tried it many times. Greetings to Mrs. Caroline. Tomasz"

The lecture is also conducted in a clear and understandable way, giving examples to each statement, definition etc. etc . The credits are given through circles on the exercises, but when you roll up your leg and the doctor also conducts a lecture, you have at least 4 more chances to get a pass (exam, exam revision, revision, revision, revision, revision) People who do not get a pass at Dr. Jacak are people who did not come to the question simply You can express yourself in the very superlatives of support I recommend! ! ! ! ! !"
5192,"I rarely speak about doctors, but in this case I have to make an exception because I think that such people should be written about. Dr. Jakubowska is a person full of incredible inner warmth, incredible charm and great empathy to her patients. She is always very cordial, understanding and helpful. And what is the most important she is a very competent doctor. She always very carefully and with great care performs every examination. She has never underestimated anything, she is always very meticulous and what is most important, her diagnoses and the way of treatment have always worked. Besides, she has great contact with children. My daughter Doctor loves her! If you could award medals to doctors, it is Doctor Jakubowska who deserves GOLD! More such people and our world will really be better!"
5193,"Room prepared for Russian guests, very different colors and a lot of glowing elements in the room. The only very tasteful place was a dining room in old Georgian style. The hotel staff who received us was very helpful and communicative. The downsides of the hotel include communication between the changes in the hotel: we ordered an early breakfast (we were assured that there will be no problem with preparing an early breakfast), however, it turned out that the morning change knew nothing about it. The advantages include the quick reaction of the manager to the whole situation and the preparation of a quick hot meal."
5194,"I've already stayed at the Ekotel several times and I've always been happy. Very polite service in the languages, it is very clean and tidy and a lot of common space (kitchen, foyer). Internet access is good, but not in the rooms. It is possible to order meals in the café on the ground floor (unfortunately not the best place). A floor below as for rent conference rooms, goo line is a good place also for conferences and seminars."
5195,"The next step would be to show how changing the secretion (expression) of these genes can affect the development of Down's syndrome. Because maybe the effect of the excess proteins produced in the body by these genes can be stopped somehow. Scientists want to study the development of Down's syndrome in an animal model. ""The obvious choice here is a mouse,"" said Professor Tybulewicz. . . And he added that this mammal is not so far away from humans in evolution, and the genome of this rodent is already well known by man. He explained, however, that there is a problem. ""Genes from the human chromosome 21 are found in mice in three separate regions: in fragments of the mouse chromosomes 10 , 16 and 17"" - he said ."
5196,"This year's weather forecasts leave no illusions: the summer, or at least the first part of the summer, is supposed to be varied by rains, storms, lower temperatures. Unfortunately, such prognoses may mean that guests of many hotels and holiday resorts will be bored in their rooms. Creating a great offer of spending time actively in the area belonging to the resort or hotel does not require a lot of money, but an idea and consequences. It also requires employing people who will be responsible for time animation. Ideally and well perform this role students who work in the facility for two months. But beware."
5197,"I don't know what to think about him. she treated him for 6 years. she had 3 surgeries, after which she was very happy. for 3 years I have been trying to have a child and nothing. only a year ago he made a concrete diagnosis - endometriosis. he treated me for 4 months with expensive medicines and I am supposedly healthy. all possible tests went through, he stuffed me with medicines, without any results. I have another cyst and I do not qualify for surgery. and yesterday, when she pressed him, he told me with the best solution will be in vitro. after that, she came out of my office crying. She did the tests he ordered, but I don't know if I'll go there at all. and when I go to probably copy the results of the tests, it's probably high time to change the doctor. one more thing at first she saw me more interested and now she doesn't know where he is. and as for the money, he never wanted to take it from me even after the surgery."
5198,"Hello. Let's start with the fact that this is not a hotel just as much as it's a hostel through the little "" h "" . Why? Because the conditions in it do not allow you to call this building a Hotel. I don't want to write down so I'll get to the point: WINDY: there are two that the hostel owners just forgot about. First of all they smell of mushrooms, they drive as they want, that is . wait ok . 10 minutes to open the door and by the way they stutter - obvious lack of service . In this situation, booking a room on the upper floor makes no sense. So in the end the booking of a room in this hotel is not necessary at all because taking a room on the ground or first floor will be associated with purely post-war views. FAMILY WITH CHILDREN - not at all recommended! problem with elevators, mushroom, dirt, etc. WATERBASE - pathetic (water to the knees ...) ROOMS - all of them smell of sewerage. . I don't know how, previous comments were positive! The rooms are cleaned very superficially. On a good day you can see the dirt, destroyed and dirty pillows. Balcony - forgotten by the cleaning service. On the plus side of the daily exchange of towels (but it is rather no revelation only standard) WORLD - stopped probably in the 60s. EATING - the only plus point . The food was good, fresh and a bit monotonous. ALKOHOL - did not take 'em, but heard 'em that ""baptized "" LOCALISATION - to Barcelona very far. The rest of the cities can be reached about. 30 minutes. Objectively - I do not recommend! All the guests from Poland and some guests from the UK who were in the hostel at that time were of the same opinion. It's only a pity that 1 in 1000 clients decide to write a comment. If we had known what kind of ""hotel"" it was, we wouldn't have decided to go on vacation in this hotel and in this ruined area."
5199,"Unfortunately, a huge disappointment. Especially from a neurologist you can expect more empathy and commitment . The doctor who generally did not have any ideas whatsoever from which the huge pain results, the questions usually answered I do not know, it does not suit me to neurological ailments. After many visits to an internist, an angiologist, 3 outlaws, 4 neurosurgeons each said that the pain is neurological and after excluding other symptoms you should seek help from the neurologist. Unfortunately after the visit the man comes out even more sore with the doctor's approach to the patient. And he certainly does not want to go back there, despite the pain preventing normal functioning."
5200,"The reception is a nightmare when you booked in this hotel, I was not informed that the swimming pool and spa will be closed, but I was told that I must arrive at the hotel around 16 because the rooms will not be ready in advance and check out at 12 o'clock where the hotel day is. The rooms have no bathrobe, slippers, in the bathroom bathtubs where at this level of the hotel should be as standard I stayed in a room with a view of the car park. The hotel, in my opinion, has more of a business rather than family character, except for the pseudo-businessmen pretending to be wise men with slick hair during the day and in the afternoon turning into simpletones unable not to swear even with children playing in the nearby playground."
5201,"In the Institute of Experimental Biology of . M . Nencki PAS in Warsaw, mice with very precisely modified genome are studied. Thanks to the possibility of disabling a specific gene - called Dicer - in adult individuals, mice can be used to better understand processes related to such cognitive functions as learning and memory. Moreover, these transgenic mice may prove to be an interesting material for research on metabolism disorders resulting in obesity, the representatives of the Nencki Institute inform in a message sent to PAP . ""The knowledge about the functions of individual human genes is absolutely fundamental both in biology and medicine - says Dr Witold Konopka, head of the Animal Models Laboratory at the Nencki Institute. - But how to know the functions of a gene if we cannot make genetic modifications in humans? The only method is to create a suitable animal, for example an adult mouse in which the gene could be switched on or off in order to model the disease properly. This is easy to say, much harder to do. Especially when it comes to genes that are really important for every cell."
5202,"I've been to this hotel a few times already, last time in July 2015. Unfortunately, there is no air conditioning in the rooms and at that time in Switzerland were terrible heat. The room in the daytime was 32stC, at night 29stC. . . . .nightmare. The rooms were small, modern but very cramped. . . . .like a luxurious destination. Likewise, bathrooms. Plus for breakfast and very good coffee for breakfast. The price/quality ratio of a nightmare."
5203,"Being in this hotel we had a tasty lunch and dessert, a nice atmosphere until the time of the lady who was listening in the room with different ideas and nadazam and to the staff. Wanting to pay the bill they heard 'em that I have to wait because the conversation with the staff is ongoing. Something like that has not yet seen 'em. I waited 10 minutes and I won't be back. Arrogant behavior."
5204,"A visit like a time travel. A hotel should rather have 2 stars and belong to a chain of hotels for tourists with low expectations than be a position in a fair city. The only plus for a nice service at the reception and restaurant. Room 118 in question is a 2-person room with an extra bed inserted I do not know for whom because we have not booked it. The free space is so much that you can move the chair away from the desk which stretches along the entire length of the room . The lack of air conditioning, ventilation in the room as well as in the bathroom is to be helped by a whirlwind fan that sadly waits for the user of the room in the hallway. Beds are not very comfortable. Service in the restaurant is a nice pity that the matjas are salty as a barrel of salt and the rest of the additives are barely noticeable. Such a Novotel and a charm as in the communist times."
5205,"Super stay , apartment ok , comfortable beds . The food is great, for dinner every day a different kitchen, we tasted very Italian cuisine: ) to the beach soon 2 minutes. The stay was very successful, and my dog was very happy because he was with us: ) Only the pool requires frequent cleaning: )"
5206,"As Dr Łukasz Kozera, the head of the facility in Biobank, which is located in one of the buildings at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the Wroclaw Medical University at Borowska Street, said during the press conference, biological samples will be collected not only from patients suffering from cardiovascular or autoimmune diseases, but also from all residents of Lower Silesia aged 25 to 75 years. ""Currently, scientific projects are based on the use of research on a large number of patients, because it guarantees, among other things, good quality of their performance. Materials for this type of research are made available from biobanks. Each of us, for example, by donating blood to a biobank, supports such research and automatically guarantees better medical care for our children or grandchildren in the future"" - stressed Kozera ."
5207,"She came to see Mr. Doctor by chance, just through the portal Known Doctor when she needed a quick gynaecological consultation. From the very beginning you could see the full professionalism of the doctor. Third pregnancy of 39 years old - shock and fear for me and at the same time a kind of joy. . . dr . From the very beginning Pietrzak, sincerely speaking about dangers but also giving hope, has been leading the pregnancy for 5 months. Each visit is performed with a professional ultrasound, which in comparison to the one performed in a state institute gave a full picture of the child's health. The doctor does not have a problem with performing tests despite my fat; ) I recommend every mother-to-be to consult with your doctor - it gives a lot of peace of mind and a different perspective on her different condition: )"
5208,"The only positive hotel is a place in the very centre by the fifth mare ( market ). The good ends here. The service was not pleasant when we came at 4:30pm. The reception was closed after a while, a lady who seemed to be very disturbed by our visit. The room on the first floor is dark and we will not survive with a window to the corridor, so you need to have curtained curtains or else no privacy. No sunlight and fresh air. The only thing that can save the situation in the summer is air conditioning. Nice furniture looks like antiques. Unfortunately, the size of the bed as for a child person 1 . 85m has no chance to straighten up on it . The bathroom at first glance is fine but if you look at it is a shower cabin so dirty with not so pleasant to get in to wash. I do not recommend ! ! ! Unless the only selection criterion is to be located in the center."
5209,"Breakfast was ok. At first glance everything was ok but after a long time you can see many things to improve. The rooms were not cleaned as a matter of luck, as for me this is not acceptable. I booked a larger number of rooms because they were wedding guests. After the wedding the guests complained to me that the rooms were dirty, I was ashamed that we were so disappointed when choosing such a hotel. Not all employees know the price list of services and products. I asked for a pillow for allergy sufferers 3 times and I didn't live to see it, even though the second time I heard that I would get it and the whole stay had to sleep on a decorative pillow. The owner does not pay attention to what he says, left and right. Criminal behavior. During the stay insulted my mother several times commenting on certain things, the worst of which she quotes "" . . . . .if it's your child,"" she says, ""it was about a daughter who is 5 years old. How can you say something like that. The advantage of the hotel is the location and the breakfast. And you have to ask for a regular bill because the hotel is not in the habit of giving out a bill. The wedding guests extended the day and at an early price they paid 50 zloty more, which I had to explain, well, I had it all in the mail because the lady working at the reception claimed otherwise. I often travel and spend the night in hotels of different classes so I have a comparison. The hotel does not deserve 3 stars. Cleanliness and service in the hotel is the most important thing but here someone forgot about it."
5210,"That's the doctor! She's not actually talking to the patient. Looking at the computer, she says something under her nose and it is necessary to make an appointment for the next visit! ! She's not nice or nice, she's not that kind, she's not that personalized! As far as competence is concerned, I don't know, she can't hit me with a dose of this thyroid jumps in different directions! The doctor can't explain why that is ! !"
5211,"Best Western in Poland has joined the Best Western chain offering 24 rooms, a 3-star Best Western Poleczki hotel located on Poleczki Street in Warsaw's Ursynów district. Thus, the number of hotels operating under the Best Western brand in Poland has reached 12 facilities offering a total of 1288 rooms. A simple calculation shows that Best Western, present in Poland since 2001, has statistically increased by 1.09 hotels per year. In practice, in the years 2001-2010, the chain once more hotels and once less. A more stable and dynamic growth was observed in the last year. r . A more stable and dynamic growth occurred last year when 6 hotels joined BW. According to the earlier announcements of BW representatives, the chain wants to maintain the dynamics and end 2012 with a potential of approx. 20 hotels . The official announcement of the hotel at Poleczki Street joining the BW chain is to take place on 26 April."
5212,"On-line bookings from your own website are more effective (cheaper) than bookings from booking portals and telephone bookings. Hotels, which are active in social media, are experiencing an increase in the number of bookings, while hotels ignoring this type of media, are losing bookings. Social media campaigns encourage bookings much more effectively than traditional e-Mail campaigns. The most profitable for hotels are bookings made via mobile phones.

5213,"I was at this doctor's about a year ago with a problem of blurring the image in my eye. For the visit for which she had to wait about an hour longer than planned (well, it happens), she found out to me that my eyesight is perfectly fine (she paid over 100 PLN), only there is something at the bottom of the eye. Two weeks later she went to see another doctor (where she had to pay again) because it didn't leave me alone and it turned out that I just have astigmatism, which was confirmed by one more ophthalmologist because I was desorbed by two ""diagnoses"". If it wasn't for the fact that I was looking for an ophthalmologist for a routine check and again here she accidentally found me, she probably wouldn't even have written me that opinion. I don't have any other comments to the doctor, I don't have any less knowledge, experience or sympathy, although I was disappointed."
5214,"I warn everyone against using the services of Magic Dental Studio of Mrs. Lipko-Leśniewska. The doctor acts extremely unfairly towards patients! Taking advantage of her reputation, she arranges the patients to each other, and then the patient goes to the doctor's office! She spent some time looking for a specialist orthodontist for her daughter and decided to treat her with Dr Lipko-Leśniewska. She made an appointment for her daughter. During the first visit my daughter had all the examinations done, as I was informed. Only the next visit was to take place at your doctor's place and on the basis of the research the treatment plan was to be discussed. The husband went to this visit with his child. I was surprised when he informed me when he came back that the daughter had been examined and only at the next visit will the treatment plan be discussed. She was also admitted by a completely different doctor. She called me at the office to explain the situation. The lady at the office couldn't explain why not all the tests were not carried out at the first visit, as it had been established before. Only now she advised me to inform that the doctor was changed because Mrs. Lipko-Leśniewska has no time and will not treat my daughter. In order to treat the child with anyone, she did not have to look for an office 100 km away from her village, so she gave up the treatment in this office. However, then it turned out that Mrs. Lipko - Leśniewska will find time and a new date of the visit was set. She gave up the subject of a completely unnecessary visit, which was carried out as a result of sloppiness on the part of the office and under-care to make sure that all the tests were done on the first visit. For the next visit we waited a month. One day before the appointment, I received a phone call from the office, but Mrs. Lipko-Leśniewska has no time and they are prescribing my child to the doctor who took her last. In this situation, she definitely resigned from treatment in this office demanding reimbursement of the test results and the cost of an unjustified visit. The results were given to me after repeated phone calls the day before the visit in another office. Reimbursement of the costs of the visit was refused ."
5216,"I've had volleyball with him for three semesters. First class guy. He knows what he needs, and he sets requirements for each group individually. I compare it with him because I have already passed at least 6 WF - ow . He puts 5 for max 1 unjustified absence and he sticks to it. I think that you can safely recommend him to people who want to improve their game because his approach to work with us is professional. The remarks are correct, the activities are varied."
5217,"The hotel is nice. It fits into the area in which it is located. And in my opinion it is one of the main advantages of Masuria. The food in the restaurant is fresh and tasty. It is good that in the hotel, which is by the lake and by the forest, you can eat fish, mushrooms and jam from the lambs: ) Nice service. I was there the second time. I consider the stay to be successful, although once again the impression remains that someone could take care of such a beautiful hotel better, better keep an eye on the order. Sticky stains from the carpet in the room can be easily removed, you can sometimes check if the pool table is not flooded and covered with chips and you can fill up the soap dispensers in the bathroom in the room and at the restaurant; )"
5219,"Good value for money - as if by the roadside, but like a room on the other side it is quiet, clean, tidy, nice service - a tidy motel - I recommend! Breakfast is decent - good coffee - from the coffee machine at the cash desk - a little flies annoy - but well - this is the standard."
5220,"As the guest of January 10, I still maintain my opinion. The doctor was not caring and responsible. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I'm not the type to panic, and my judgment is not retaliation for Dr. Dr. . Maybe she treats patients who are privately pregnant differently. My two negative experiences give me the right to maintain my opinion."
5222,"In March we booked a room for August ( 4 days ). The price was to be 90 PLN per day. On the spot we were informed that this room costs 170zł, but will be rented to us for 140zł. Moreover, the employees did not even know for how long they arrived, in the system they had a one-day stay. They asked us to contact the manager, which was met with a categorical refusal of arrogant and insolent staff. They asked us for the official price list, but we were also sold. We were informed that the manager has the right to do whatever he wants because it's his hostel, he doesn't have to inform us about the price change, because it's our duty to call 2 days before arrival and ask if this reservation still exists at all. He added that the small print on their portal was given about the price change, however, when they asked us to show it, the employee said that he did not have access to it. When they told us that we were going to lodge a complaint with the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection, an employee said that in that case he was going to ask us out of the hostel. Unfortunately, we were not the only ones affected, and we were accosted by many people with similar problems. Avoid, and if you have been cheated by the hostel (or hostel at the fish market - > the same owner), report it by email to the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (http://www.uokik.gov.pl/), it is worth that someone takes care of this problem."
5223,"The best place you can choose in Podhale ! For the second time I had the pleasure of spending a weekend in the guesthouse ""My Tatras"" . I am delighted with the climate and charm of this place. Spacious, clean, well-kept and beautifully decorated rooms, a living room where you can relax by the fireplace and play table tennis or watch a movie with friends, a place to play for the kids, a great home kitchen that can easily compete with this grandmother. You may find most of these things in a few other places, but you certainly won't find the atmosphere created by the owner, who takes care of every guest, who cares about the well-being of everyone, who is willing to talk about the local culture, who will recommend places worth seeing, will lift hearts of everyone. It was my second weekend here, but I hope there will be many more."
5224,"I recommend lunches in this guesthouse, inexpensive and very tasty. It is about accommodation, it was not yet a guest of the guesthouse, but she saw me have a family room. Very nice, clean and cozy. I will definitely come there one day for a longer stay. We go to Krynica with children every year for 12 years but only this year she used the restaurant and I regret that so late, because it is really worth eating there."
5225,"Delicious food, very big choice, two restaurants - regional Greek and international, who will find something for everyone, the choice is big so you can eat something different every day if you like variety. The rooms are elegantly furnished, very clean. The service is very nice. The only downside is the beach, near the street - a rocky beach we gave up using, the more so as it was very small. The rooms are on the hills so for some may be a disadvantage, but for the lazy, the hotel provides a taxi: ) we'll be back there for sure, a great place to relax completely."
5226,"I was at your doctor's in February on an ultrasound, he said the pregnancy was dead, with a mockery in his voice and a smile on his face he said 'this is how it is when you're in your thirties' he referred you to the hospital. after a teaspooning and 1 period went m for a check-up visit, and he told me he wouldn't accept me because they ran out of money from the fund and I have to come for 3 weeks. Currently I am in 16tc . she was in the clinic because for a few days she did not feel my son's movements (and she felt them for 2 weeks regularly) ladies nurses jumped over me for half an hour with the detector and checked my heart rate, unfortunately they did not feel anything. The doctor did not examine me for ultrasound, he did not even look at my stomach. . . . .because he had an interview with some newspaper! ! ! ! He didn't have time! He just told me to go to the hospital for the E.R. My husband is angry, I'm desperate for the situation."
5227,"The hotel is quite high level, although a few details are missing. The bathrobes in the rooms since there is an enclosed swimming pool, coffee, beer and drinks in all inc. could be in any bar and not just in the all inc. zone. This can be solved by reading the hotel card data. This is just the details. The worst is the company of guests. We went out after the season to leave Gdansk not far away because with two small children. In the week a cataclysm started very pleasantly. The butterfly that arrived here is mostly ""belfry"" who had a day off on the occasion of the teacher's day and surprisingly did not behave like teachers at all. On the contrary. Seeing something like that, you can have a grudge against young people in schools. . . . : - ) It was completed on Friday when the remaining vacancies were filled by ""Warszafffka"" this proverbial. Most of these people seem to be let out of the cage for the first time, enough for the first time they were allowed into the hotel. I understand the hotel's approach that after the season there are promotions to fill the vacant rooms and make money unfortunately this reflects on the holiday for guests. On the contrary, the children's zone was quieter than the adult zone which was filled by the mob. He doesn't write it as a typical outsider or boredom. On the contrary, I am 33 years old and I am a very entertaining person, but seeing such ""guests"" I am not surprised by the opinion about Poles in the world. : - ) : - ) : - ) To sum up the hotel after the season revelation. From Sunday afternoon to Thursday to 12 pm. 00 ."
5228,"Positive impressions, worth recommending, however, 5 stars should not be set for it is Turkish something around 4 . Purity as in the Turks ; ) service without any problems . However, the most important thing was the weather and the beach - here the expectations were met - the beach is clean, the water in the sea also. Hotel swimming pools clean"
5229,"Lack of respect for guests, even rudeness from the mouth of the hostess. In addition, ""throwing away"" guests at 10 o'clock. 00 00 from the room even if the reservation form states that you can check out by 12 o'clock. 00 ! Really lack of professionalism and pure understanding for people (traveling with a 4 month old child is not so easy and I think it wouldn't bother m if m checked out an hour later! ) . The housekeeper is only seemingly nice, she has bad bad bad things to say and she is very feisty. It was the worst holiday she could have imagined! I wish you, dear hosts, that all guests will finally stop greeting you!"
5230,"At once, from the entrance you can see the terrible dirt and wear and tear of the building, the incredibly dirty stairwell, old carpets, a terrible lift. The price is absolutely inadequate to the conditions. Rooms although cleaner than the hall do not encourage. Instead of a shower cubicle curtains (unlike in the pictures of the official object) I do NOT recommend"
5231,"My health problems started in 2007. Initially I was looking for help in conventional medicine, but unfortunately it did not bring me any relief. The health problems were really big and painful. In 2011 I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis - an incurable disease in Western medicine. In the meantime somebody told me about acupuncture, dared me, benefited me and convinced me on my own skin that this is something wonderful. He used em to use acupuncture with a few people, but nobody helped me like Dr. Nguyen Van Tuyen. He got 'em from the very beginning, as soon as he appeared in Poland in the beginning of 2014 and to this day I still go to the implantation treatments - Katgut . Compared to traditional acupuncture, this is a much better way of treatment because the doctor introduces short surgical threads into the body at the appropriate points on the human body (depending on our illness) . This treatment is repeated once a month, so it is much more convenient for the patient because in the traditional acupuncture treatments I went for 3, 4 times a week and here it is only once a month and in fact throughout the month are stimulated by the threads and not as in the traditional acupuncture only when there are needles. And now a few words about what I've been suffering from: serious immune problems, eternal colds, sinus pains, cross, buttocks, back, thighs, legs and chest pains. Today, thanks to the Implantation - Catgut method, I no longer have these problems and pains. I highly recommend Dr. med. Van Tuyen Nguyen is a man of great knowledge and skills. I recommend that you try this method at least once in order to assess the influence of Eastern medicine on your body. I don't know a better specialist."
5233,"Amazing doctor. His commitment is incredible. I've never met a doctor with as much empathy and kindness as Dr. Sarosiek. I called him in February that I have 15 cm of semen. He invited me to visit him the next day, Saturday (! ) because he said it couldn't wait. Throughout the whole period of treatment he took care of everything for me: referrals, examinations, doctors, stays in hospital. He told me to write to myself if I would run out of medicines or even feel worse. He said that the most important thing for him is to cure me. I admire him, where he gets his energy from. There are 40 people queuing for consultations and he doesn't refuse anyone. He treats everyone individually. Today the results came - I am healthy. He has guided me through the whole treatment as best as possible. Tomasz Sarosiek is the best doctor you can dream of and additionally he is a fantastic person."
5234,"The rooms at first glance are fine, however after a while you can see how much you need to improve. The cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired (fern on the carpet), the quality of service is mostly fine, however, not all the staff is friendly to the customer and treats him as an aggressor. The standard of the room is tragic, broken window sills, broken and not working lamps, outlying sockets. The price does not correspond to the offered standard, based on experiences from other 3 star hotels and guest houses."
5237,"Hotel very neglected. Our stay lasted 15 days. During this period the room was cleaned once, despite the intervention. Requests for cleaning made at the reception were not successful, only a conversation between the travel agent and the manager helped (one-time ""wipe"" of the floor). Towels exchanged daily, dusty, stored on trolleys that stood outside in a total mess (photo). Dirty linen, not replaced . Mattress on the bed stinking of fungus and moisture, the sofa in the room so dirty that we did not even sit on it. Often dirty glasses and glasses in restaurants and bars. Around 7 p.m. there was no hot water, and in the morning we had to wait for beach towels because there were not enough of them (a hotel not suitable for such a number of guests). Hotel staff not speaking English: neither the reception desk (except for one lady), nor the cleaning crew, nor the restaurant staff. The only plus: varied and tasty food."
5238,"Warimpex Finanz und Beteiligungs AG, a hotel and development company, is planning to sell its 50 per cent share in the InterContinental Hotel in Warsaw in 2012 for an amount above the carrying amount, the company announced in a press release.

The transaction will have a very positive impact on the company's 2012 results and liquidity"". as shown in the message ."
5239,"In fact, maybe I won't say evaluate this restaurant because there aren't many things I've tried in it and I only evaluate it from a service point of view. At 1 p.m. 00 they tried to find a free table in it but they were all booked and the waiters found no other free place for us than the bar . They sat down, ordered us beer, wine, coffee, salads and started to watch us. Within 90 minutes, many potential guests passed through the restaurant, but because of the reservation, no one used its services. At the same time, within 90 minutes, the customers who booked it did not come to any table. O 14 . 30 we had to leave the restaurant and we don't know what time the whole show ended. I don't know what is the policy of this place but for me it is completely incomprehensible."

The first hotel created by InterContinental Hotels Group in February this year will have 230 rooms and will be located near Grand Central Station in central Manhattan. The hotel's rooms are designed for exercise and equipped with hypoallergenic linen and antibacterial wipes. The hotel will offer gyms for indoor and outdoor exercise, as well as a catering facility with a special healthy menu. There will also be conference rooms in the building. The investor is a developer company CWC , Inc . . IHG expects to sign 100 franchise or management agreements for running Even hotels on the key US markets within the next five years."
5241,"The nightmare here was a real nightmare for me and my husband ! ! ! ! The room had a strong feeling of mould, bedding, blanket, everything even though it seemed to be freshly painted. However, the worst thing was the fear, when at night in the adjoining rooms there were scenes of Dantean drunken bums, screams, threats! The company was very suspicious. Hearing it all, she just felt like running away from there in the middle of the night! ! ! With a hand on my heart I do not recommend, I strongly advise against it. There is a murky company going down there, and a man instead of resting is lying in fear at night. To this day we still remember with horror this unforgettable night, for no small price!"
5242,"We've never had to deal with such an arrogant and rude doctor. This lady and our 2-month-old daughter, suspected of immaturity of the nervous system, were taken to this lady. At the very beginning of the visit we were discouraged by a bored and offended doctor's face. Then it only got worse and worse. She accused us of carrying the baby wrongly and assumed in advance that the problems were due to my bad feeding technique. During the whole interview she treated us as bad parents whose mistakes made the child have such problems. At times, she undermined and mocked our knowledge of infant development. But the worst part was the research itself. This doctor doesn't have the right attitude towards children, she is so insensitive, that then it was hard for us to calm our daughter down. I'm surprised at this lady's approach, because the visit was private and we were not there for free. I don't recommend it to anyone and I don't wish to be in contact with this lady."
5243,"Now I will present - thanks to the help of Tambourine - 25 elements and properties which are indicated or even necessary for the website of our hotel to sell effectively. Read MORE > > > > 25 desired functionalities of the hotel's website - cz . 2 The choice of 25 functionalities comes from Tambourine, their development and description is my own. The hotel as a company has to make sure that it owns the domain of its hotel! It is necessary to renew it. That is why it is important that it is taken care of by trusted and professional people. If only because the ""offended"" employee does not want to forget to extend the domain or in an extreme situation, take over the ownership of the domain. What about the access to the domain data is very simple. The site must load in three or less seconds. After this time there is a good chance that the user will escape from it."
5244,"I don't know how you can take that doctor's hand out for more money, not to mention your actual health. My mother treated her for 4 years, 4 years going to private visits, giving her money to save her life. The doctor can never be found in the hospital, she runs all the time, hides in the doctor's room with all this company. She killed my mother by giving her morphine a year before she died, if it wasn't for the doctors at the Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital she would have died earlier. She didn't try to treat her, and still sent her to her husband's private service, where the description was never consistent with the facts, which unfortunately she found out too late. I don't recommend it, and I'm afraid, Doctor, it's terrible that such seriously ill people have to go to doctors like Dr. Zielinska or Dr. Pietraszek."
5245,"No revelation for me, but maybe I've got some kind of product missing. . . I have had the device since December and used it maybe with 5 times. Each time the apartment was smoky and stinky (like a burnt cable or something). The food can't be completely out of sight even for a moment because, due to the lack of temperature control, it burns quickly. As for the non-stick coating, my Panini probably gave it up - every time something sticks and cleaning the tiles is a nightmare. The only thing I can praise is the appearance ; - )"
5246,"From the very beginning the Czech film and water in the mouth of the staff. The hotel service except for the cleaning ladies at an embarrassing level, you have to pay for everything in advance before the service is provided and if you are dissatisfied with the quality and demand compensation, they refer you to the regulations in which it is said that everything is written and ""you had to read""? ! The reception desk is not competent in any way - they do not inform about anything rudely - they do not react to the problems of the customersParent manager of the hotel probably does not know what the name of her position means because her work cannot be called management In the hotel jacuzzi water at 30 degrees - after 4 days someone graciously reacted to our requests and raised the temperature to 34Lux rooms? ? ? Only by name they are a little bit bigger and that's the only thing that's weird about the daily cleaning in the rooms. Despite the strange smell - probably due to very poor ventilation - it's impossible to dry things on the beach because the radiator in the bathroom doesn't have an option to switch on if necessary Eating as much as it's okay - it's just weird that there is no menu for the daily dinner option - if you come to eat at 17, you have 50% of other, usually worse dishes than at 18-18. 30 (dinner till 19) and the staff never knows if for example the ribs that have just finished will still be or not. This hotel is NOT worth its price It should cost 50 / 60 % less than nowadays and then you can only wonder whether to go - I discourage you"
5247,"In most cases, the Doctor is really nice and pleasant. However, if she has no sense of humor, she's spraying and unpleasant. E.g. she refuses to perform an ultrasound of her ovaries for a fee because something has messed her up. She doesn't want to examine her breasts. She misinterprets the hormone test results. Advantage: she often sends for tests."
5248,"Course: Physics 1 Lecture , Physics 2 Lecture Will Go, but better to avoid [ / b ] A very humorous woman. Unfortunately, the classes in which she reads slides are not interesting, you can also download from the site and read by yourself at home. At the end of the course, the colloquium, or exam, usually heavy, and the grading system leaves much to be desired. I also recommend that you sign up elsewhere if you have a choice."
5249,"""Non-specific MMP inhibitors - 9 have been tested in other disease entities, such as . As a result, there is a large pool of drugs not tested for epilepsy. The aim of the project is to analyse such substances in the treatment of epileptogenesis,"" said the researcher . She added that it was planned to obtain the most promising substances and then to test their penetration through the blood-brain barrier and their inhibitory effect on the development of epilepsy in appropriate models. Dr Kozicka stressed that despite the introduction of a number of new antiepileptic drugs in recent years, still about 40% of patients remain drug-resistant. For these patients the search for new antiepileptic drugs seems to be the only way to control their epileptic seizures and enable them to function normally in society."
5250,"So we could use the general charm of Lidzbark in winter to a limited extent. The Castle has many attractions: a swimming pool, saunas, massages, fitness equipment, good cuisine, a lobby bar for evenings, a tower with a library, an inspiring adaptation of the facility for hotel needs, etc., etc. . . For the celebration of the common relationship a very good place (there is also a room for the little ones and the possibility of hiring a temporary babysitter for those who do not have anywhere to ""sell the children"" during the romantic trip; - )"
5251,"Amazing 3 days in the hotel, the staff took care of us exceptionally from the first minutes. The rooms are very clean and modern inside. The room ladies very forgiving when it comes to cleaning hours. The hotel has a lot of entertainment. Night club bowling, windsurfing school very clean lake beaches . Very modern spa with 4 types of jacuzzi 4 different saunas and salt wall . For active 3 swimming pools and many water attractions. Delicious food, very sophisticated dishes. All from local products. Restaurant and Hotel worth recommending for every occasion."
5253,"The hotel is generally well-kept, clean, probably one of the oldest in Krakow, but the facade of the building is being renovated, and the interior is very modern, especially in the lobby and restaurant. In the corridors between the rooms there is actually a little ""stinks of the Polish People's Republic"". But the rooms are relatively modern and new, the big downside is the small ""openness"" of the windows, because it is very hot in the room and the air conditioning does not work, which is a strong surprise in May. Service good. Breakfast is good, fairly rich, just a pity that there are no fizzy drinks just juices. Bus stop ""Przybyszewski"" in sight from the exit of the hotel via line 501 / 511 3 stops to the interchange center ""Plac Inwalidów"" . Location to the centre is far away from Kraków as it is in Bronowice. Generally I highly recommend this hotel. At the moment it is 3, 5 *, but after the ongoing renovations a strong 4 *."
5254,"Any such sales transaction transferred from an individual to an automated online sales process saves us time and resources. Paradoxically, we don't run away from contacting a visitor, but we have the opportunity to spend more time on the right service for people who really need it. Often the revenue management is associated with the price management itself. However, this is a more complex process. Especially for our online sales, we should consider it as a proper management of distribution channels. The main goal of course is to transfer sales to direct channels. Whether online or traditional ."
5255,"A private visit. She has no approach to babies. We were with a 4-month-old child. She did not say a word to her daughter, she did not smile. Treating the child objectively made him cry. Despite this condition, she did not interrupt the examination, did not wait for the sedation of her daughter. Therefore, I find the result of the examination unreliable. None of the questions asked were answered by me. Instead of advice, information, interest, we were referred to the hospital as a result of the doctor's ignorance. The doctor gave the impression that she was not talking, hurrying, not interested. I regret this visit."
5256,"She was visiting me with my daughter and I'm very unhappy. Another doctor focused on making money . He showed no interest on his part. He only looked at one place that had been changed to the child's body, the one she pointed out to me, and when she asked me to look at the other places, he said that today we are only looking at the one she pointed out to me first! I mean, with each spot I have to go to the next visit? ! He prescribed medications which, as it turned out after buying them, we cannot give to the child! Generally the doctor's tragedy ! I DO NOT RECOMMEND !"
5257,"Research will help to better understand certain mechanisms that lead to hypertension. Perhaps in the future this research will also help in the prevention and treatment of this disease. Wojciech Kopeć, a Polish PhD student at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, together with his team studied the sodium and potassium pump, and especially one of the proteins that make it. ""It is present in all human cells. Its primary task is to properly maintain the difference of sodium and potassium ion concentrations inside and outside the cell,"" says Wojciech Kopeć in an interview with PAP. The task of a protein is to remove excess sodium from the cell and inject potassium into it. The researcher explains that a protein is so common and necessary that it seemed that any mutation in the gene encoding this protein would cause cell death."
5258,"He was generally able to do it. Unfortunately, after 11 months the vacuum cleaner went crazy. A little drive, a little bit of a squeak and either returns to the base or gets lost somewhere (room 20m2) and nothing comes out of vacuuming. Unfortunately, Secnor (sencor.pl) only services those Sencor vacuum cleaners that come from their distribution. Bought in Polish Internet shops unfortunately do not necessarily fall into this category. It is probably better to add to the proven solutions of serious manufacturers who can organize the service, or let go and sweep the broom."
5259,"A family holiday in this hotel is pure pleasure. Numerous swimming pools (some with heated water during the ""winter"" period), lots of greenery, enough sunbeds. An all-inclusive option is a sensational one! Throughout the whole stay something was happening every day so there was no question of boredom. The surrounding area is quite decent, nice cross-country trails. To the beach a little bit but a nice walk."
5260,"Two years in a row we were here for Christmas and New Year's Eve with a group of friends. The hotel is unrivalled. New, clean, fragrant. The cheapest, in Zakopane, Bialka, Bukowina or Poronin even guesthouses are more expensive. Here we have a large swimming pool (as for hotels in Zakopane) jacuzzi, bowling (two tracks), billiards. Meals (breakfast and dinner buffet) tasty and uncluttered. Restaurant a'la carte is some kind of madness (although the waiting time b . long) . The service is very friendly and nice. Rooms very large . Located very high up (it is worth having chains just in case), which makes the air here is sensational. Taxi to the center about 30zł (hotel guests have a permanent discount) . Next to the hotel, a cult regional restaurant "" 7koty "" On Christmas Eve - fusion cuisine - and each dish decorated with a different edible flower!"
5261,"She was in the economic part. Small rooms with a small bathroom, clean and tidy. A small TV and small towels but comfortable beds and despite the proximity of the motorway very quiet. Very tasty kitchen! I especially recommend regional dishes. Nice and helpful service. There were a lot of foreign language clients and they did not notice any communication problems. Both the reception desk and the restaurant staff speak English well. The hotel is situated on the outskirts of the city but at the A4 and it is about 15 minutes walk to the centre. There is a large shopping centre near the hotel. The surroundings of the hotel leave a lot to be desired: a strange courtyard parking lot, some hashes around, unpaved paths leading to nowhere, some fairy tales, architecture also some clumsy and looks more like a workers' hotel from the 80s but already inside is quite pleasant."
5263,"One of such important genes is the Dicer mouse gene, which Dr. Konopka has been researching for several years. This gene, whose analogue is found, among others, in the human genome, has its share in regulating the work of other genes and its activity is essential for the proper functioning of the cell. The Dicer gene cannot be switched off in zygotes, because it will prevent the proper development of embryos. However, scientists have developed a way to cut out a specific gene from the genome of a suitably genetically modified adult mouse using pharmacological means. ""The first mice in which the Dicer gene could be switched off at any time were given 'em a few years ago during a postdoctoral internship at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. Now we also produce them in the Animal Model Laboratory of our institute. But creating the animals themselves is only part of the work. If we want to conduct research with the help of mice, the animals must be properly characterized"" - points out Dr. Konopka ."
5264,"In 13 weeks of pregnancy the doctor recognized the sex of the child (girl), which was confirmed after the birth. The pregnancy was conducted super, although she was not an easy patient and often panicked, she trusted Mr. Doctor absolutely. I wish everyone such a doctor, to whom you can turn with any doubts, and to those women who are looking for advice on Internet forums I advise to change the doctor to one who has knowledge and experience. Thanks to this, I have been able to survive until the solution and my husband did not get neurosis? ? ? "" if I could put out 6 stars? ? ? ?"
5265,"We were dining with our husband and son a few days in a row just before the season, because we lived next door. We ate dinner sets. Average food. Two days in a row, a bottle of bottled water, the second day was fucked up. The child didn't want to eat it, a lot of small things were swimming there, weed, chopped garlic, etc., I also liked it on average. The soups from the set cooked ""on wine"" and some untypical ones - e.g. there was no tomato soup in the set, which we would gladly eat. Russian dumplings artificially yellow in the middle - why colored, I do not know. . . only tasty pigeons. Fries are hopeless and you never know how much you will pay for them - if you order a separate portion, because they weigh the portion they want. The service from the eastern border is not very easy to understand. There is no waitress service, you can't find a waitress service, you can't get a dish from the window. Menu contains dishes ""from sasa to las"". , Polish , Italian , fish . . . . .it's hard for them to have good food if they can't focus on a particular kitchen. Generally I am glad that in the second week of our stay we changed our eateries to a bar with typical homemade food (bar Szpilka mniam : - ) )"
5266,"I've been treating you for over two years. I have hypothyroidism. She seems to be a nice person on the level - but I witnessed the patients leaving the office talking to her and commenting on their behaviour behind their backs. At the beginning it was ok . Although the Doctor made one of the first visits when choosing contraceptive pills (earlier the gynecologist changed them twice as an experiment; she felt bad, she had e.g. dizziness). She said that in total we can do an accurate hormone test, as she put it, ""we'll do well, because normally she would pay m for these tests over 600 pounds. "" I won't even comment on such a statement to the patient. . . Anyway, I got a hypotension, she got a Letrox m, checked herself regularly and at one point it was time for the baby. After the checkups, the doctor said that we can act with the husband. We succeeded ""after the first approach"" and of course, being afraid of thyroid problems and complications because of that in the child, she asked the doctor if she would be able to lead me in pregnancy - she agreed. And well . . . . . .I'm 7 months old, even once I wasn't examined, I didn't have a cytology done. If she hadn't been seen by another doctor she probably wouldn't have had enough basic tests done by now. One of my visits lasted over half an hour - and she didn't have a chance to ask the doctor any questions because after 5 minutes she apologized politely and made a private phone call to a friend and talked to her for over 20 minutes in the meantime writing prescriptions and drawing the phrases on a piece of paper. Then she left the office with me with the phone at her ear, came up to the registration, stamped the prescriptions and said goodbye. I would like to add that under the office there was a crowd of patients. I confirm that she leaves the office and disappears for 15-20 minutes and then comes back with some friend under her arm, with whom she closes for half an hour, regardless of the fact that under the office there are women waiting for a few months earlier and often rushing to work. . . Recently, in her pregnancy card, she discovered with amazement that I am after infertility treatment - which never happened. . . . . .of course, she had my tests done, but she had no problem getting pregnant and she didn't take any medication either. . ."
5267,"The hotel is located quite far from the sea and has its own beach. The rooms are quite small, with an extra bed it gets quite cramped. The rooms are clean and comfortable despite their small size. Breakfast is not very tasty. Not very diversified. The hotel is more for a weekend trip than a family holiday."
5268,"I have 2 remarks to the doctor, notwithstanding his knowledge (on the basis of several visits we have made): - during several visits with about 15 minutes 10 consisted of a phone call, then rushed to write a prescription. . and the next one. - When my husband had a palpable heart after administering a desensitizer, it turned out that in the doctor's private office there was no efficient device for measuring blood pressure - since then she wore her own device for desensitizing just in case."
5269,"Maybe there are better places in the world and it is hard to find a place where people are as friendly and cordial as in Novotel Krakow City West. Already during the very welcome we were surprised by the cordiality of the service - we felt really like the people the hotel was waiting for. . . . At the reception desk, the very nice and smiling faces - Mrs. Ola : ) greetings, at the pool super - Mr. Marek was really very nice - he exchanged a few words for the safety of children. . . . . . .it was nice and pleasant. A very comfortable room - clean and well equipped - everything neat and nice. The location of the hotel - it is not in the center but something for something - the free bus went even on holidays. As far as breakfast is concerned - standard Novotel : ) but the staff is nice and very helpful - the waitresses are always smiling and resistant to children's whims : ) . Special thanks to Mr. Janusz - deputy chef - the guy with whom the conversation itself is a great pleasure, not to mention the omelets they make in the kitchen of the dog . in Krynica snow was already : ) . Bar very well equipped - it was nice to sit . Mrs. Ania - a very warm bartender person - the son even drew a laurel - we talked about various matters - all this made us want to go back to this place . Thank you ! ! ! I have Gold status in AccorLoyalitty . . . . . . . .I know the hotels of the chain. . .) I can safely say - one of the best hotels of the chain in which em was: )"
5270,"The room was unprepared despite an earlier check - in online, the room smelled of cigarettes although it was supposed to be for non-smokers, airing did not help. The windows were so dirty that it is a shame to comment. Parking space stinking of sewage and stuffy. I absolutely do not like the approach to the issue of parking charge - the charge per day does not mean that you pay for 24 hours only part of the hotel day. On the second day we parked at the competition and paid for the actual parking time. The room wasn't cleaned - the staff knocked on our door in the morning, told us that we were already leaving with the children and that she should come in about a minute. 15 minutes, unfortunately you did not come back. Despite paying in advance for the stay with breakfasts at departure, the receptionist wanted to charge me for breakfast - although she had a printed reservation on which there was a note to be paid 0 PLN - she did not know English? ? It's a good thing she had a picture of my reservation confirmation (in Polish) on my Iphone."
5271,"Choosing a New Year's Eve package in this hotel for gigantic money (as per the proposed conditions and ""attractions"") is one of our biggest mistakes. We were guided by ads, ads and the image of the hotel, which is created as a mega luxurious. . . After 4 hours of travel with a child and a cat we received our hotel room card. . . When we entered the room, we were impressed by the bed, covered with crumpled, crushed bedding. In the room. . . . . . .dirt. . . Carpet stained, one window in the room, balcony window, leaking, problem with opening (how to ventilate the room, with one balcony window which cannot be opened when you come with a cat? ) on the windows, water condensation, curtains are creased, pulled out, not cleaned. Bedside table with a broken drawer. Lightshades of lampshades strongly after passages, walls disgustingly dirty, stained, no air conditioning. And a cherry on the cake - the bathroom. Oh. . . . .on a towel-drying heater a thick layer of dust, shower. . . . . .with a powered mushroom. I think that no confectioner would be ashamed of such skills of decorating cakes as the person who silicified the shower a few hours before we came (characteristic smell), a bathroom mixer that only qualifies for replacement. Lighting in the bathroom tragic, making makeup in such light, only with a flashlight from the phone. So much for the room - Mrs. ""manager"" or ""manager"" did not even defend herself, because and how? If she had this dirt in front of her own eyes? The room was changed. We waited almost 2 hours for it. At that time no one offered us to go down to the restaurant for coffee, we went alone. . . Another room was cleaned quickly, a little cleaner, but the amount of air freshener caused us to vomit. . . After some time, it turned out that the thermostat at the radiator in the room did not work and the radiator at 25m2 heated the whole steam. . . Also no air conditioning. I don't know how people survive there in summer, we had to lock the cat in the transporter on average every 2 hours to open the window on the doorway and cool the room. The night was terrible. Generally small, uncomfortable, non-ergonomic rooms. The food was very poor. Pigs ""from a bucket."" ...a typical underdone pot. . . New Year's Eve menu calling for vengeance to heaven . If someone has been tempted by the noisy BBQ ribbs, I think he broke his teeth on them. The advertised ""walk"" on the red carpet in the flash of the flashes had nothing to do with reality, there were no flashes. . . The orchestra playing at the New Year's Eve party prepared a strange repertoire, and when the DJ was playing during the break and it was already thick after midnight, people started to have fun, the orchestra entered again. People asked him not to play anymore, to stay with the DJ, they were told that the orchestra must play. . . Only after a few people intervened at the reception desk did they get rid of the orchestra. The open bar offered five drinks, and after 2 o'clock at night people started to refuse to prepare them. Waiters served clumsy jokes when asked to bring vodka to the table. . . There were no fizzy drinks on the tables, they had to be asked for them, and the waiters were reluctant to carry them. A New Year's Eve party was organized for the children, but the animators did not control the group - the children left the room where and when they wanted, and yet the hotel is located by the lake. . . The hotel staff . . . . .nobody knows anything, all the under-informed. Nobody told us that the zoo and seal room tickets are in the room, that if we wanted to go, we had to take them away, and when before we left, we were asked at the reception desk, we were told that enough at the entrance to the zoo to say we were at the hotel. At the zoo box office, however, nobody knew anything about it. . . ehhhh. And the waiters. . . I had the impression that for 3 days, from breakfast to 10 p.m. and then on New Year's Eve to late at night, the same people served us. After talking to the guests, we know that we were not the only ones who felt uncomfortable because we were served by just tired employees. After New Year's Eve it turned out that although they informed us that we were coming with a cat, the first room we were offered was exactly on the side where the fireworks were played. . . Billiards in the bar (one table) paid. Bowling alley (two lanes, high price, beaten balls, a malfunctioning bowling machine that would lift the bowling alley back even the ones that were beaten). A swimming pool with very strongly chlorinated water, for 90 hotel rooms, tree cottages and a fishing pool far too small. One jacuzzi. . . . .eternally occupied. The total stay for 3 nights with the New Year's Eve ball amounted to about 3500 PLN. . . At this price she was expecting me, for example. . . . . . .cleanliness? And good food. . . I'm very disappointed, I won't go there again. If it hadn't been for the fact that we were with a tired child and a cat, we would have left as soon as we saw the room."
5273,"I agree with the previous opinion, Mr. Szmuda may not be too effeminate, but we come to the doctor to be treated and not tied up friendly. And he really knows what he's doing and in addition he does it very well. And if I had to ""use"" the services of a neurosurgeon again, he would choose to have an AMG clinic again."
5274,"I will start with the fact that Wroclaw is my beloved city and every attraction in this city is worth attention. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights ( 31 . 12 / 03 . 01 ) and I remember it very well. The service is very professional and friendly, breakfast is delicious: ) We warmly greet the Lord who was on duty at breakfast on Sunday 3 . 01 : ) The big advantage of the room that we had was the bath in the bathroom . A small mini-sik is a door in the bathroom that does not close and does not fit well in the toilet, but after a few attempts we managed to close it. I highly recommend the hotel has quite a large parking lot and relatively not expensive. It is directly connected with the city centre thanks to the tram loop at the back of the hotel (near national 5), tram no. 17 runs often and in about 20 minutes we are in the centre of Wroclaw (where the hotel is about 5 km away from the market square)."
5275,"In order to do this master's exercises, unfortunately, one has to learn, it is best to solve all the letters that he gave. The tasks on the colloquiums are similar to those of the letters, so it is worth to redo them! on the first date of the group of 50 people passed the exam. 10. the tasks to be corrected were arranged by Mrs. Hajdusianek, so everyone has already completed them: ) He takes to the board ( the willing and unwilling ones ) if you can't do it "" minu s"
5276,"I'm definitely not. This person is very arrogant, very critical of other doctors and I don't like it the most. He tells you to stop the drugs given by other doctors and gives you your - "" better "" . When I heard that I have an allergic child, he had all the carpets thrown out of the house and checked for mould in the walls. Ladies and gentlemen, let's not get crazy, after all I won't keep the child in a real sterile house as he or she will go to the sandbox and take the sand in his mouth. One more very annoying thing is that this doctor tells himself to write down what he says about the dosage. This is the first time I've seen such treatment of a patient who pays 100 PLN for the visit anyway. In such a case you will never have any objections because ""together with what"" you can blame the patient for wrong recording. I think that someone should take a closer look at this case. Of course I advise against it."
5277,"Plus: Free garage, clean bathroom, very close to the center. Minus: We got a twin room, even though we asked for a double room in the reservation. Hot in the rooms, noise until late hours from the restaurant opposite. Poor breakfast - fruit and vegetables not fresh, obviously prepared much earlier and stored in the fridge. The rooms are not very nice. In the pictures the hotel looks much better."
5278,"I think your stay in this hotel is good. A few days of rest passed without any problems. I confirm other opinions that the food is very good, every day different, tasty, to choose from several hot dishes, lots of vegetables, sauces. As for alcohol - as described, these are local drinks, you can taste or drink and wait for the effect: ) The rooms are clean, cleaned daily, the air conditioning system works for an extra charge. Something from mosquitoes will come in handy - but they only cling to those sitting after dark in the bar :) There is no crisis - no queues for cash machines or petrol etc. As for the refugees - none of them have seen them when they were in several towns, including Kos . The Greeks, as usual, were helpful and satisfied."
5279,"You can see the old object, you can also feel it at every step - the smell in the corridors. The interiors require a thorough renovation. Both corridors and rooms. Elevator in a lamentable state. The room in which I stayed one night was clean but like the whole hotel requires a thorough renovation. These 3 stars are too much."
5280,"The bottom ! ! ! A muddy swimming pool, black jacuzzi with dirt and spoiled, squalid and unclean rooms, next to the train route - as the train passes, you can't hear your own thoughts, generally stink and poverty. The surroundings are neglected, no grass, patches of sand, in the rubbish forest, a window in the balcony door in my room with bird celebrations, and in the corner on the balcony a mountain of poets. I was fooled, naive, I thought that in a civilized country such things do not take place, but the reality has outgrown the worst imaginings. People avoid this crap from afar."
5281,"On the weekends, we went to the Black Cos site after reading the description. The description is very catchy, but it feels cheated. Modern interiors - Hahah . Crazy tiled visions . Cathode ray tube TV, which can not be watched . Rooms decorated completely tasteless - a combination with entanglement . During a 3-day stay, nobody cleaned or changed towels. Dust in cabinets per centimetre. But the worst thing is that the owners and employees completely do not react to rude and mega loud behavior of guests who spoil the stay of the rest. The peace and quiet, the communion with nature is not possible. Breakfast, medium or rather weak, has nothing to do with slow food cuisine, which is delicious and deserves praise. Just like the cheerful bartender and the price of alcohol at the bar. Unfortunately they close quickly and after 20 you will not eat anything. Without a car, you won't go anywhere. Taxis won't come if you want to drive to the town next door for a beer. Prices of accommodation are clearly too high for this standard. Old furniture will not let you forget where you are and how much you paid for it."
5282,"Lectures at the doctor's office look standard: he writes quickly, often wipes off the boards but keeps up with it. Almost all the material is from her scripts. Credit: within a semester of 4 circles, then a written and oral examination, possible corrections and the possibility of extending the session, it is also worth to be active on the exercises and somehow lock-in with your doctor, it makes the credit easier. Attitude to the student: it's all right, you can talk about a lot of things, sometimes it tells stories from the past. For those who want to study algebre I highly recommend! A little bit of effort and you can easily pull out 5 at the end. hmmm it's me who will introduce you to some arcana of exams at Mrs. J . It is also possible to get a set of sets (especially those "" ratu n"
5283,"Course: Labour Law gives advice [ / b ] Generally, a nice lecturer. You can talk to him after class, ask questions about the law (he is probably a lawyer too, somewhere he heard 'em). Attendance in class is sometimes checked, on average every 2 - 3 classes. At the end of the colloquium. If you've learned this seriously, you'll pass. If ""you taught"
5285,"I have very weak teeth, or rather she had m, because I've all been cured, and the doctor took care of them so that I wish it all. She kept hearing that my teeth are weak, that nothing can be done with them, that it is best to remove them. And the Doctor, not only did she quickly come into contact with me, but she also made me believe that dentures are not my destiny. It turned out that I have strong roots, no periodontosis, only weak enamel. She motivated me to take care of them, and now I have beautiful teeth, my own, because she got used to the crowns, and most importantly, she stopped being afraid of dentists, because they are also people. It lasted six months, but now I don't have a visit for the second week, only in six months, and I miss it. The doctor is a very warm and kind person and everyone who works in this way also wanted to thank me for my care and for the power of optimism that she received."
5286,"Nice 3-day stay. The weather was terrible . but the hotel was lovely and nice service - especially the ladies' staff compensated me for the lack of sun. The food looks much nicer and tastier on advertising materials, but I'm not a foodie so no problem. However, I won't forgive you for the complexion under the sheet, so I subtract one star,"
5287,"A wonderful place in the Knyszyńska Forest to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Rooms are very tastefully decorated, well equipped, I did not miss anything. A place worth recommending for trips and walks. The hotel has a quiet atmosphere, the ladies are discreet and take care of details. The nice thing about the hotel is that as a guest we did not feel embarrassed, the hotel is located in a place where the silence is around, which suited me and my loved ones very much and left nice memories, the waiters service very professional, discreet. On the occasion of my business trips I always find time to visit this unusual place even for coffee Congratulations to you, Z . P . S . LIKE S . A ."
5288,"Course: Differential equations Assessment: I highly recommend This gentleman is amazing, non-compulsory lectures, tasks on colloquial banal. To the circle itself can be learned in 1 h, even shorter. The list of tasks is given earlier, you just need to assimilate them, then on the wheel it turns out that I give the simplest of them, and what makes some more simplifies! ! Just a fairy tale. Finally, the 4.5 and 5.0 alone. Sign up if only possible : )"
5289,"During the weekend stay with friends in the hotel there was a larger group of ladies who played loudly in the swimming pool / spa area, preventing the peaceful use of these parts, also in the evening the whole catering service was focused on the reservation service. I have no objections to the work of the reception and cleanliness of the hotel."
5290,"The location of the hotel ensures easy access to the city centre by subway - line no. 8 will take us to Concorde Square, the Bastille and near the tower. The room is clean and well equipped kitchenette. French breakfast so it's much better for the same money to go shopping in a nearby shop (near Liberte metro station) and taste various French specialties. There is also a large shopping center nearby. Underground parking is available for an additional fee, but it provides security."
5291,"Fantastic location of the hotel and a nice architectural body. It was a little fun to get there. I got 'em, but there's nowhere to park. He parked 'em on a nearby street because you can't get under the main entrance. There's not much room for a blocked driveway anyway. Nice service at the hotel and probably so much fun. How does this hotel have 4 stars? It seems as if tomorrow it is going through a major overhaul after the socialist vision of an elegant hotel. No air conditioning - a windmill, and outside 30 degrees target. The temperature in the room is high and stuffy. You have to open a window - it's a bang from the traffic. The view from the window - to the top of Gellert's mountain - so it's actually on the bushes. There are rooms overlooking the Danube - for how much? After an hour. 20 : 00 pool closed . Only in the morning from 6 : 00 . Breakfast OK . Bathroom does not correspond to 4 stars . Ugly . Furniture and bed - headaches! Price extremely high . Finally a curiosity - the car remained for the night on the street adjacent to the hotel among other parked there. In the morning, only mine was standing with a blocked wheel by the Budapest city guard. After almost an hour of waiting they arrived and with a smile on their faces deleted 11500 forints and wished a pleasant journey. He thanked 'em for their hospitality for a lot of money and with a smile also drove 'em out of the hotel. This hotel is > LIPA"
5293,"He took 'em out of the ""lazy Sunday"" package. that extended me an extra day. Wonderful room, comfortable bed, beautiful bathroom. Breakfast to the room very tasty, warm and very large, you can order whatever you want! The hotel restaurant and the drink bar in the hotel also keep the level! The rooftop pool is impressive because the view on the boat is beautiful! I recommend you to break away from everyday life!"
5294,"A guesthouse located in a beautiful place and a large room are probably the only advantages. On the floor a beautiful carpet - underneath the floor moving protruding parquet staves. All sockets hanging from the walls . Cold water in the shower . The towel dryer did not ""fire"". On TV 5 programs . No parking lot, the car has to be left a little further on the floorboards. You have to put your suitcases on the stairs, there is an elevator in the pension. They ordered a room with breakfast, which was forgotten, we had to go to Henry I for breakfast. We went for a weekend with small children and expected more facilities for 200 PLN per night."
5295,"Organizing a wedding reception in such a place is the best decision that we have made, everything is at the last button, not replaced manager Mrs. Maria organized us the best reception in the world, she was our support, she was our advice and patiently answered all the questions that bother us sometimes even trivial but for us so important for organizing such a day. The food was delicious, the service was nice and professional, the room was beautifully prepared and the wonderful owner of Mrs. Elizabeth, a volcano of energy: ) An incredibly climatic place, brilliant decoration, professional service and still something interesting is happening here, concerts, fashion shows, conferences and great cosy dance evenings. We will definitely come back here. . . A . G ."
5296,She went to this doctor at the beginning of her first pregnancy and quickly gave up m . Little patience and no good attitude towards patients in my opinion. He answered my questions only briefly and I often had the impression that it is best not to ask him anything because he does not want to answer me. She changed my doctor to Dr. Dariusz Zaryjewski and finally she started to visit me willingly and was not afraid to ask questions.
5297,"I recommend it! He lectures quickly, sometimes you can get lost, at colloquia medium difficult tasks, however he has a good approach to students. . . ""Stud e"
5298,I had 2 courses with Mr. Bednarski: B 1 and B 1 / E - a sense of humor and attitude towards a bdb student and at the same time you can learn.
5299,"Even platforms connecting interested parties with bloggers - influencers - are already being created. I personally know two such sites: SnapTraveller and Polish Hash . My own blog has the greatest potential of all free channels in the Internet. Efficiently and with an idea, it can be an almost unlimited source of traffic to our site. Not to mention more extensive functions such as direct communication with guests and employer branding. Going even further, it may become - especially in smaller towns or tourist resorts - another local medium. The world's biggest brands are developing the journalism brand seeing the potential in it. So I see no obstacles why hotels should not do it. Anyway, they are already doing it - e.g. Mamaison chain and Polish Puro Hotels."
5300,"This was my first visit, so it's hard to assess the accuracy of the diagnosis and treatment. However, the visit as well as the doctor herself made a very good impression. The doctor is a very nice person, inquisitive and clears all doubts. Compared to the previous gastroenterologist I can recommend this doctor."
5302,"Always nice and smiling. Unfortunately, after every visit I get the impression that ""art counts"": (He pays less and less attention to the person and the problem and focuses on cash. Just a few years ago I wouldn't have said a bad word about it, now I'm seriously considering changing my doctor. . ."
5304,"""It's a man's close neighborhood. If there are no or too few bird hosts, and if their populations grow excessively, the hungry fringes can infiltrate the dwellings and attack people, mainly during night-time rest,"" - said PAP prof . Solarz , who heads the Department of Parasitology of the Faculty of Pharmacy with the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the UUM in Sosnowiec . Pigeon ticks prick very painfully and their victim feels pain and itching for a long time. Skin lesions may persist for up to 1 or 5 years. As the parasitologist emphasizes, it is very dangerous to attack the face - it can cause swelling or tick paralysis making it impossible to breathe. The stabbing may also result in inflammation of lymphatic vessels, and in sensitive people - allergic reactions. ""In extreme cases, repeated stabbing of the edges in sensitive people can cause anaphylactic shock and death, such cases have been reported in Poland"" - warned prof. Solarz ."
5305,"Wlaź said that he could function well for many years, but at one point his health deteriorated with every month. ""Even at the end of June this year I was able to walk 400 meters and before the operation even 100 meters was a big challenge for me,"" he said. Prof. Mariusz Kusmierczyk explained that the patient had been waiting at the Warsaw Institute since March 2018 for a suitable donor from whom a heart and liver could be taken. ""He was heartless and we were afraid that something might happen to him at home. We also wanted to make sure that he is well prepared for this difficult operation, that there is no infection and that the kidneys work properly,"" he added."
5306,"Hello, was 'em in this hotel in 2013, booked 'em by trivago. In my opinion, because of the internet reservation we got us a room on the top floor. The room was untidy, generally for these prices very poor, the bathroom was muddy. At night there was unfortunately no hot water: ) supposedly it was 4 stars, I would have given m 1 star and unfortunately I will never return there. I think that's why I got em such a room that I booked em over the internet. Some hotels have such a patent that the ones from the Internet sell for a lower price in Much worse conditions."
5307,"Biology 1 , lecture: ok ! The doctor is always well prepared for classes. Computer presentations brought by her are always legible, and lectures, although conducted at a very fast pace, give a lot and are worth going to. I highly recommend . . ."
5308,"The hotel is very nicely decorated and looks like it's in Morocco. The location of the hotel is good because it is located near the most important monuments in Brussels. As for breakfast very modest . Hotel equipment a little lack of kettles in the room, and would be useful in the autumn and winter."
5309,"For a family with children I sincerely recommend.maybe 4 stars are not, but full of 3. meals for a rich - I have 2 kg, flexible eating hours.full of attractions inside. no fungus I have not seen a swimming pool clean.a little small beach.for renting water bikes and kayaks. The price includes bonfire, carriage rides and horseback riding, fairy tale shows. there were a lot of children of different ages. for such a price it's really grazing. I'm sure I'll be back. I don't know who writes these negative opinions - probably the competition, or cunning dreams, which want to have luxuries for free."
5310,"Hello, I do not have a lot of experience when it comes to gynaecologists - midwives (at least for now - I am childless), but the Doctor will help me a lot with another disease! I have had two doctors before, one of whom completely ignored me (and worrying symptoms), and the other - from a public hospital - proposed methods of treatment from the early 1980s. When nothing helped, I went to Dr. Rubik, who was recommended to me by a friend, with great effect! I go now regularly, do a check-up of cytologies, ultrasounds, etc, always a nice atmosphere, very clean office and answers to all questions. Cheers."
5311,"He was 'em on a visit to pick up an eight. The procedure itself went quickly and painlessly and that's a plus. However, the fact that the doctor did not prescribe me any antibiotics or even painkillers, did not inform me about any postoperative recommendations deserves to be taken. Unfortunately, I had complications and I had to take two strong antibiotics later, so for over a week I could not eat or drink."
5312,"A beautiful resort, clean rooms, close to the beach and very varied food. Access to sun loungers by the pool as well as on the beach did not require getting up early. Resident Mrs. Monika Tekin did her job at 6! Her immediate interventions made it possible for us to spend our most beautiful holidays. I recommend a holiday with TUI and necessarily a trip ""Underwater World of Alladin"" . They wanted us to go back there one day!"
5313,"It was like I read in some people. At the beginning ""WOW"" the super doctor knows so much about me here after touching it hurts and sleeping with one leg under control is not healthy etc. I naively swallowed everything and even adjusted to the diet. Cones and tamoxifen were also. A year of treatment and, of course, lost. A friend of mine, a lot older and a good friend, after my praise, also landed at the doctor's, of course, the same talk and medication. Unbelievable what kind of talk she has and how she can convince us. I wonder why such a good doctor only takes it in private? ! Don't get carried away by the fantasy of getting pregnant will make us believe what he tells us. I recommend to consult with some of the specialists who work best in public! ! ! !"
5315,"The only advantage is the low price, but for business travellers this is not an argument. 10 minutes from A2 , on the main route . The hotel is noisy, you can hear conversations, kitchen sounds, etc. In addition, in the room from the side of the road you can hear the noise of cars. The food is rated as 2 / 5. Milk bar level . Breakfast is included in the price, but he preferred to pay extra and eat like a man. Breakfast: 3 slices of ground meat, 4 slices of bread, butter, a piece of cucumber, tomato, coffee or tea. Just add yoghurt, sausages, jam, cakes. Parking is free. Room in economy version. Quite clean. Bed linen for several years. Small TV, multiplex available. Bathroom small but fairly clean . Available towel is suitable to put under your feet . To sum up, I propose to make the offer more expensive and to suit the tastes. Overall rating 1 but some people are looking for really cheap accommodation."
5316,"Hotel nicer in the pictures than in reality . The advantage is the proximity of Chorzow park, planetarium and zoo. Toilet with bathroom by the glass door and sink in the room may be 'designer' but if it is practical for guests - I doubt it . Medium cleanliness, I have the impression that it was not vacuumed very thoroughly. The first time I met was also when two people were staying with just one glass of water and one plastic cup to help wash your teeth. The first time I met two people with only one glass of water as well as one plastic cup to help with brushing teeth. The surprise at check out was also a request for a surcharge for the next breakfast, even though we ordered it only once. The cards were also demagnetized. Quite a decent hotel kitchen. In general, I have the impression that the hotel is a bit chaotic."
5317,"The hotel is fantastically situated, quiet and peaceful. Amazing, unforgettable view from the window to the lake. High standard of rooms, order, attention to detail! Very nice but incompetent service for a hotel of this standard and five stars! The swimming pool did not operate ""water attractions"" and some saunas. Breakfast is very good, fresh fruit and vegetables. . Transport from the car park and reception to the hotel by melex. Prices in the restaurant are very high minus. No butler. Generally recommended, especially with a view of the lake. Fantastic surroundings and the hotel itself. We are very happy to return to Hotel Mikolajki."
5318,"I do not recommend the Novotel in Katowice. The price for accommodation does not correspond to the standard, the hotel has grown old and requires field refreshment. So what if there is a gym if ""the treadmill has broken down""? The sauna is very tight and despite the advertising only dry. The staff very kindly, good breakfasts, expensive parking. Close to the Museum of Silesia and the seat of the National Heritage Sites."
5319,"I travel with a large dog, about which she informed me during the reservation, asking about possible difficulties for the pet, such as difficult stairs. ""No, there isn't"" . After entering the guesthouse a surprise - we were greeted by a very steep and very slippery staircase, as it turned out, quote . : "" all dogs are afraid of them "" . The hall was clean, tidy, the room (number 21) was already less. Kettle strongly stoned (request for descaling ignored), cups covered with a layer of dust, teaspoons not yet cleaned. There is some coffee, no tea, no sugar, but a mini fridge. Bathroom with shower - silicone in the cabin covered with pieces of black mould. White towels, clean, rough. No regulators on the radiators, as a result it was either very cold or very hot. After opening the window she was stunned by the loud noise of the restaurant ventilation and intoxicated by the smell of fried oil, so she immediately gave up ventilation. The bed was very soft, the pillow was big, soft, the duvet was thin and cool - fortunately she had a blanket with her. Above the door in the room, a lamp indicating the escape route lights up strongly, making it impossible to get darker even when the curtains are drawn - impossible to switch off. Decent wifi . Reception desk is open theoretically from 7 o'clock . 00 am, but at 7 . 05 service was still ""on the way"" . Probably far away, considering that the nice receptionist appeared only after 07 . 15 . Parking is free of charge, close by, but what if it's clogged to the borders? In general - a lot to improve ."
5320,"As a specialist without reservations . However, she did not expect me to attend a philosophical lecture. I was underestimated, judged by one measure, my doubts were not dispelled. The only benefit of this visit was ultrasound, which I could have done in my clinic and not pay so much for it."
5322,"An ideal place to relax . A very quiet place . A large clean swimming pool with plenty of deckchairs and places (there is always something). A lot of greenery and an amazing view of the bay. Charming descent of the footbridge to the private beach. The sandy beach is clean and well maintained in the sea stones, deck chairs and parasols free of charge. Food very good, breakfast - you can attach with no changes, lunch and dinner - every day other very tasty dishes (different cuisine - meat, pasta, seafood, a lot of vegetables salads, etc.) service super nice and efficient food addition and care about the cleanliness of the room. One bar by the swimming pool where drinks are served (by the staff - not by themselves) tasty drinks not overflowing bar open to 23. The second bar is located on the beach but is not included in the offer - additionally paid. Rooms - minimalism is probably a good and gentle term - rooms are probably the biggest minus of the whole object, poor equipment and ever-wet bathroom, air-conditioning works oki, clean. WiFi available in the lobby (near the reception) in the rooms and other places no free WiFi (only paid). The object during our stay did not organize any animation, peace and quiet. Nearest civilization 5 km taxi about 6 €, not recommended on foot (very busy and dangerous road). The hotel is definitely designed for total relaxation - swimming, sunbathing, food, views. Our trip considered successful, we are athletes and a week of such total relaxation away from the world was something we were looking for."
5323,"Someone who expresses himself in the very superlatives about this hotel has not seen another of this standard. The service is not pleasant / the receptionist outside of the hotel. Peter's not ready to give comprehensive information, without a smile; I had the impression that I am persona non grata /, the cleaners do not know why they work there / they only changed my towels, I had to ask for vacuuming the carpet - the stench in the bathroom, not once were the taps were not washed, not to mention the toilet seat, on which she saw a large layer of urine from the inside for a good day - moreover, during my stay was also not washed /, on the furniture found two weeks of dust. Non-special meals, rotten, flabby grapes also happened. Only cakes were good. On the beds there are feather quilts / at 30 degrees of heat in the rooms / . Animations for children aged 7-10 years; for the younger ones too wise, too little interesting, for the older ones too boring. The greatest joy for the little ones were inflatable castles, on which they could jump at will. Beach with ugly sand. No umbrellas. The hotel advertises itself as pet-friendly, so people come down with dogs that go down to the water at the same stretch of the same time. 15m as the children and bathe with them. Nightmare. Besides, she saw m dog droppings on a clearing where the kids ran. In the Góralska Chata, the prices are inadequate to the size of the portion / e.g. a cup of soup for a child 15 zł or a handful of salads with a tomato 23 zł / . Only the area is really large, well-kept, varied greenery, pleasant lamps and lanterns."
5324,"I often have meetings in this place, the hotel and restaurant correct but not crazy. The dishes of the card are tasty but not surprising, you can see the lack of ingenuity, originality of the chef. The place is mainly focused on conferences and mass food."
5325,"The Groupe du Louvre, which consists of the economic part, i.e. Louvre Hotels Group and the luxury part, i.e. Concorde Hotels, grew by 1.5%. This was a decrease of almost 7% in 2010. It is now in 4th place. However, the last year's results were not as good as those of the previous year. However, last year was connected with cleaning the portfolio before this year's merger with Golden Tulip. Two Spanish groups in ""Top 10"" MKG Hospitality: NH Hoteles and Melia Hotels International, did not record last year's merger with Golden Tulip. The two Spanish groups in the "" Top 10 "" MKG Hospitality: NH Hoteles and Melia Hotels International , did not record too much growth in last year . This is due to problems in the home country and the search for new capital ( NH Hoteles ) or industry ( Melia ) partners."
5326,". . .in a word, failure. The ladies at the reception desk are not very friendly. . . . .at breakfast total emptiness. . . No bread, empty trays and plates, no juice glasses. Dirty tables, no interest at all. . . The gentleman came to collect one plate on an empty tray and left the cups. . . The lady was supposed to bring a glass of juice but somehow she didn't manage. . . . .and the beach. . . . . . .what kind of beach. . . .by the hotel, some poor piece of sand, squeeze and all that. Another minus the lack of a swimming pool where you could swim in bad weather. It should be a hotelik 2 * no more such Ibisik. . Even a beachside restaurant with umbrellas where you could sit down was gone. Oh, thin, thin. . ."
5327,"A great doctor and a phenomenal grandmother. Mega human approach to the patient, she listened to everything she had to say and she asked a lot of questions. Professionalism at 5, and a huge plus for attitude and character! You can see that she cares about the patient, she did not count me for the ultrasound she made to make sure that she made the correct diagnosis because she said that she would feel bad about it! A total alien, but in a very positive sense. I recommend to everyone, especially those for whom a visit to the doctor is a great stress."
5328,"Let's call it ""business opportunity"". The invitation to check the offer of the Bukovina Hotel was also accepted. Compared to another hotel in this village, the description is done without a comparative scale. But objectively, it is not difficult to make such an assessment when the scale of differences resulting from the price list itself speaks about it directly and clearly. Range of services, rich offer. For those who like luxury and have unnecessary financial resources, yes ."
5329,"Very good location, close to the market. The rooms aren't too big, but it's not about sitting in a hotel, just taking advantage of the accommodation. Nice climate, clean room, bathroom, very comfortable bed, garden view, tasty breakfast, very nice service. Everything at a decent price. I sincerely recommend and in the future I will gladly use again."
5330,"The location of the hotel is as fairy-tale as the fairy tale land that is already there. Actually, it's hard to hit, although there's a sign there. I was helped by the phone instructions given by the receptionist. But once I got there, I was disappointed with it. A large room, nicely and warmly furnished, stylish furniture, clean. Restaurant and delicious dishes, rich breakfast, helpful service. I have used them with several local attractions: a spa, or more precisely an exotic massage and I recommend, bowling because I like it, horse riding, walks because the area is nice, visited them also the zoo. To sum up, I recommend that you spend a nice holiday in the Charlotte Valley especially for active people. I wasn't bored of 'em."
5331,"A great specialist, but be patient. She treated me for 3 years with him. A few times a week she was on a visit, she did all the recommended tests, she took different combinations of the lakes. Finally, thanks to my determination and the professional care of the professor, these efforts were successful. I am in the desired pregnancy. For the rest of my life I will be grateful to him for that. It was not easy: long hours spent in the hospital corridor, frequent, fruitless visits, moments of doubt. It happened that the professor did not associate the case, but he always supported himself with his card and conducted an interview. He has a lot of patients and often positively is called for consultations to other cases, He may give the impression that the patient does not care, but you have to be understanding. He is a man of great knowledge and authority, but only human. Great respect. I recommend to everyone, especially the most persistent ones."
5332,"A very nice and contactable doctor. He talks a lot about the disease and willingly answers questions . Two years ago she had my knee fluid pulled off and thought I would die so much pain. Dr. Madeja felt practically nothing in the same procedure. She is scrupulously informing about the course of further treatment. Although the visit was not within the framework of NFZ, Mr. Madej informed me that the orthopaedic equipment I want to buy is refunded and what should I do to get 90% refund. I was also surprised by the length of the visit - 20 minutes, the doctor was in no hurry and you can actually see that he cares about the patient and a good quality visit. I would recommend it. I will definitely use and yet persuaded my sister and husband. You can see respect for the patient is the best advertisement."
5333,"An increase in transplantation in our country will not be possible without increasing the number of organ donations from the deceased. In this respect we have been stagnating for several years. In 2012, 615 so-called real donors were reported, i.e. those from whom organs were donated. In 2016, the number of these donors decreased to 544 , although it was already slightly higher than in 2015. In 2016, the number of these donors decreased to 544 , although it was already slightly higher than in 2015 when 526 donations were reported. ""All promotional activities related to organ procurement rest with kidney transplantation centres. In addition, it is mainly based on the passion of the teams involved in these transplants. And that is no longer enough. Donor recruitment should be centrally coordinated and nationwide, as it is organised in Spain. Promotional activities should receive greater support from the Ministry of Health. It should also be helpful to set up in 2016 by the Institute of Transplantology Polish Society for the Donation of Organs"" - explained prof . Kwiatkowski ."
5334,"The hotel is located in the center of Rybnik - a few minutes to the market. The first entrance is from the market - it is also the entrance to the night club. The second entrance is from the back of the building. The entrance is not closed and everyone can enter the building. There is also a small car park . This entrance is from the side of the trashcans . There is no information where the reception desk is . No lift, lots of stairs . Rooms with keys . The carpet in the room wasn't clean - lots of drugs, lots of hair. Leaky windows, you could hear what was going on outside - the headquarters of the Main Post Office. The only plus is the very comfortable beds and bedding. As far as the bathroom is concerned, the toilet bowl was broken, the doors were leaking. The hotel has breakfast included. Unfortunately you can't call it breakfast. Cold sausages floating in the water, old dry scrambled eggs, a few slices of cold meats and cheese. In a word, I do not recommend it!"
5336,"I highly recommend staying at Hotel Kopieniec everything at the highest level - very tastefully furnished rooms, superior hotel with incredible views of the mountains - I think it is difficult to find a second such place, relaxing bath area, qualified staff in the physio zone, very good cuisine - breakfast and dinner, charming restaurant with views of the mountains. The mountains usually drive alone so I get an extra plus for the availability of single rooms. Thank you very much for a wonderful stay, I will definitely be back there. One small minus is that the walls are not muted."
5337,"I've been in this hotel several times in the last 3 years and I can recommend it. Rooms and bathrooms clean . The beds are comfortable, although the mattresses could be a little harder. The room has a coffee and tea set. There's a problem with wi - fi - not always working. Breakfast is very good, wide range, fresh products, some unusual for Polish hotels. Besides that the kitchen (restaurant) serves also very good lunches and dinners. There is a large parking lot (paid) at the hotel, so there is no problem with parking the car. Besides, the hotel has a very nice conference room and serves a nice catering. Generally I recommend."
5339,"Dr. Oliver Gautschi of Lucerner Kantonsspital ( Lucerne, Switzerland ) presented e.g. a paper indicating that a small group of patients with lung cancer and mutation in the BRAF gene (about 2% of patients) may benefit from the same molecularly targeted drugs used to treat melanoma patients with BRAF mutation. Prof . Solange Peters from the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne pointed out that the use of molecularly targeted therapies in lung cancer patients is hampered by the fact that cells of this cancer, like melanoma cells, have much more somatic mutations (i.e. formed in body cells rather than inherited - PAP) - on average approx. 200 - than is found in the cells of other malignant tumours."
5340,"It's okay, but no crazy. First of all, a terrible moloch - a huge room, mass of people, noise, noise, something terrible! Because secondly, the walls are terribly muted. She heard the lady in heels above me walking around the room at 3 a.m. and some couple next to me were spending time passionately. Thirdly - advertising, promotion on TV and God knows what, as if this hotel was some Eldorado. The service was very weak and rude. The food is very average, and the huge dining room at the beginning scares. Okay, the bass is cool, but maybe you had to do a water park and not a hotel?"
5341,"Hotel located on the east coast of Madeira , close to the centre of Machico , ok . 25 km from the capital (Funchal), approx. 5 km from Santa Cruz airport. In part 10 floors and in part 3 - a bay view pavilion (note some rooms, at ground level, without sea view). 24 hour reception, bay-view restaurant, buffet meals, free internet access only at the reception. Ok . 100 m to the pebble beach behind which is the second sandy beach one of the two in Madeira (the second in Calheta)."
5343,"He chose me Dr. Paduch as his POZ doctor. After the first visit, I can say that he is a very nice man, calm, helpful and helpful in explaining things he was not asked about. I won't give you an evaluation because he hasn't used his help with any problems so far; he just asked me for a prescription for the medicines I have to take. It's interesting that it turned out that he can prescribe much more than I was told before, to make it last longer - that's what made 'em very happy. I think the pharmacists in the pharmacy were also very happy that they didn't have to guess what the doctor prescribed me - he wrote the prescription on the computer and printed it out. A little bit, but after visiting doctors in smaller towns, you start to have a little faith in the fact that maybe we are not technologically that far behind the Negroes; ) By the way, the whole Dolmed seems to be quite a medical center. It is said that in some time it will be possible to register online. For now I can recommend if someone is looking for a nice and helpful internist. The information at the office shows that Dr. Paduch specializes in diabetology. I hope you don't have to check his knowledge in this field."
5344,"I hope that both my opinion and that of those who have spoken about this centre so far will contribute to the fact that you will not make a similar mistake and will not book a stay there. Let the situation of many deceived people be a warning to you. At the beginning I would like to mention that after the breakthroughs that were made by the owners of Eco-Vita or Novatim Eco-Vita because they operate under different names, the owners continue to advertise on possible websites offering a stay in this ""miraculous"" resort. My New Year's Eve package has not even started. The owners have collected the money for the whole stay with the New Year's Eve party and to this day they have not given away the money . they have sunk underground . they do not answer the phone in one word they have in respect all and all people cheated in the same way as me . I mention that the day before New Year's Eve on the way to the place I found out that because of the accident neither New Year's Eve nor accommodation will be and the money will be returned on the first working day. Unfortunately this did not happen. Also noteworthy is the fact that the website of the resort is constructed in a completely hypocritical way. I was personally bothering myself to this place and to my surprise it turned out that from the outside the resort does not even resemble to a minimum what you can see on the photographs attached to the website . Fraud ! Fraud ! and once again, Fraud ! Mr. Pawe³ek S . the great manager would have the courage to inform the invited guests on New Year's Eve that it wasn't the failure that caused the cancellation of the event but the closure of this place after the failed Christmas Eve by the sanitarium. Mr. Pawel and Mrs. Joanna, people are starting to talk more and more about you and not only in Sianożęty Koszalin Sianów Kołobrzeg or Ustroń Morski. With such scams that you do, I think that soon you will also be able to watch TV. Give money back to people!"
5346,"On January 14th, Monday, the President of the Republic of Poland Bronisław Komorowski will visit a four-star Bania Thermal & Ski Hotel in Białka Tatrzańska . The visit to the Bania Hotel is part of the President's visit to Podhale . The purpose of President Komorowski's arrival are places where the highlanders, cultivating local traditions and using the potential of the region, have achieved success. For example, on the premises of the Bukovina Terma Hotel Spa in Bukowina Tatrzańska, the President will meet the local community and entrepreneurs from the Małopolska region and give a speech. This year President Komorowski will bypass Zakopane. ""President Komorowski's visit to Białka Tatrzańska is certainly a historic event. Such a distinguished guest in less than 3 weeks from the opening of Hotel Bania is, we hope, a good sign for our investment"". ...says Paul Dziubasik, the owner of the hotel. President Komorowski will also visit the Bania Ski Center and Kotelnica Białczańska ."
5347,"He wanted me to confirm very good opinions about Dr. Wolf. For a long time I was struggling with the pain in the right knee joint (believe me, for a young man active in sports it's not a problem). ...until finally my unparalleled girlfriend spoke to reason with me. So we went to Parkowa 25 where, in a nice and calm atmosphere, I was thrown through the latest issue of Newsweek, just like several other magazines made available to patients waiting in line. However, I couldn't concentrate too much on what I was reading because I was very excited about the upcoming meeting. The doctor's office, furnished with a sense of small minimalism, didn't push the patient (as they used to meet 'em in other office spaces), but introduced them into a cheerful atmosphere reminiscent of Asian meditation methods. The doctor's person - at first glance you can see that he is a top-notch professional. A thorough examination, conversation and after a while everything is clear. For a month now I'm not in any more pain, I'm coming back to the sport at full speed! Thank you, Doctor!"
5348,"Dr. Matthew was coming all the way from Gdansk. For some time she has been thinking about breast reduction, she visited a few doctors but none of them has won my trust. She was very afraid of the surgery when she heard that it was a very complicated procedure. The doctor told me very well what will be done, what are the risks and benefits. He showed a lot of pictures. She was worried about the scars. I am 6 months after the bust reduction surgery, my breasts are beautiful and the scars are getting less and less visible and I feel light and attractive. I recommend you to Dr. Zachara and the whole professional, nice and helpful team of the clinic. It was worth going over 600 km! ! !"
5349,"Let's not exaggerate with these paeans. Dr. Rokicki is a very good surgeon, but a bad doctor. He is not suitable for long-term treatment. When the patient gets out of the hospital, he stops interested in it. So what if the next procedure is very well carried out, if the doctor has done it too late, without considering the changes that have already taken place. Besides, Dr. Rokicki very quickly loses interest in the patient, treating sick people like intrusive flies. He is busy because he likes to live at a certain level. After a few years of experience with Dr. Rokicki's treatment, I advise you to be careful and, in serious matters, to consult with orthopaedists from other institutions. I recommend Szczecin and Cracow."
5350,"We bought the iron in August. Even though it was Bosch, we were disappointed. From the beginning, we noticed that water drips from it, and every now and then the iron dirties clothes. The decalcification and anti-condensation function does not work at all - we used distilled water - even though the manufacturer allows tap water. Limescale was gathering around the water inlet. In October they sent us back to the service and after a week they sent us new ones. Unfortunately, after the first day of use the new iron also starts to get dirty and the water still drips. Completely underdeveloped line of Sensixx irons . The instructions recommend pouring out water after each ironing. Until now they had Pfilips' and Braun's laughs and nothing completely happened. I discourage you from buying."
5351,"PLUSYMING , professional service . Possibility to leave luggage before check-in . Spacious room with kettle, hairdryer, possibility to switch on the heating in the bathroom . Location in the center - by the main promenade, next to Biedronka : ) MINUSLY long stairs to overcome (from the main hotel entrance to the reception). Electricity is available only with a card - key left. Window "" no view "" . High price for breakfast ."
5352,"It is difficult to say at this point how long this recovery will last and whether it will result in a clearer increase in secondary trading. It may weaken once the economic situation emerges from uncertainty and begins to stabilise. In each case, it is an opportunity for those owners who have been trying to sell their facilities for several months or so. The facilities - which should be emphasized - are smaller . In the group of larger facilities, having several dozen rooms, offered for prices over 10 to several dozen million, there is no revival. The prices are going down and those willing to buy them are not visible on the horizon. This may be evidenced by a clear overestimation of the ""buried"" construction of the former Hotel System in Zakopane. In May this year, the facility was offered for nearly 52 million - currently for 39.9 million PLN."
5354,"I have no objection to the merits. What annoyed me, however, was that the doctor had a grudge that the child after entering the office did not tell her ""good morning"". Normally, yes, but at that point, she was dealing with a fucking three-year-old with a high fever and sore throat. When we came to the control, the child was already feeling well and, of course, he cried out ""good morning"" from the threshold. But I didn't like the earlier remark, as a mother I come to the doctor with a sick child for medical advice and not to learn savoir vivru ."
5355,"As far as I'm concerned, I have very bad memories of this Mr. Dr. . Well, I had the opportunity to see him every day at St . The families after my 1st birth. As she had m much more bleeding than the other ladies, she reported it to me on the rounds and I was asked to see him at the Services, after ok . 1 hour. First I had it done by another Dr. and then, leaving the office with the result, she came across this doctor, who cancelled the previous result and ripped it off, and then he did the vaginal ultrasound, which she was afraid to do, namely the pain around the wound after the birth. Not enough of that this gentleman invited me to a gynecological chair, not telling me what he intends to do! Nothing wrong with not expecting anything, she slowly sat me down on the chair, then the doctor put my whole hand inside the uterus and literally threw blood clots on the floor in the office, trying to get to the trash, and I break out! the vagina from the pain, lifting the pelvis up. . She was in total pain shock and could not recover for half a day. The consequence of this procedure is for sure that in my current 2nd pregnancy I have a cervical and musculoskeletal insufficiency, I have a circular suture on my cervix because I had a dilation in 25 weeks, I take terrible Fenoterol tablets, after which my arms and legs are shaking and my heart is circulating (sometimes my pulse jumps to 148 / min). I have to lie down to the end, that is 3 m - ce, I cannot work or take care of my older child. To prove it, you can find it on the Internet, that : ""The following factors are mentioned as the causes of cervical and musculoskeletal insufficiency: injuries resulting from past gynaecological procedures, e.g. manual extraction of the bearing. I will add that my 1 - gray pregnancy was perfect and doctors wonder why in 2 - giej is completely different . ."
5356,"He booked 'em this hotel and was a bit worried after hearing the opinions of other travellers. . . ...and I'm not sure why people are writing all these terrible reviews. . . . This is one of the best places we've ever been in Venice, it's a small jewel in the heart of Venice, just a few steps from the Rialto Bridge and about 10 minutes walk from St Mark's Square. The staff were very helpful and loved our room, which was very Venetian when you come to Venice, you spend most of the day walking around the city, so the hotel was ideally located in the heart of the city and there is also a boat stop next door. Hotel Locanda has very reasonable prices compared to very expensive hotels in Venice. . . I want to thank all the staff who made our stay and our honeymoon so special."
5357,"I regret to give a very negative opinion. She did not expect me to have luxuries, but it was a night in worse conditions than the worst hostel . A terrible smell in a tiny room, no table, no chair, stinky toilet seat, uncleaned carpet, could not open the window, a terrible smell. The bedding looked unchanged, people sleeping in the building smoked cigarettes all over the place which was very inconvenient. It was really better to add a few zlotys and stay overnight in a different place under normal conditions. Avoid the wide arch is a strange place."
5358,"Course : Mr. Wilczyński is very nice to the students. Lecture very nice conducted Wheels : First wheel : easy . If you don't have enough points, go for a consultation and you'll always get 1 point, it just saved me : P to get 3 x 5 points = 15 Dear wheel : easier Dr. Che to get as many people as possible passed read the newspaper and sometimes just watch what people do . Where everyone pulled off : D 3 x 5 points +1 x 4 points ( extra )"
5359,"First of all, the man, right after that doctor. In relation to patients, it seems to apply a similar principle: first of all a man, immediately after the medical case. As a general practitioner: great. He is objective, committed, open (he can listen and is inquisitive), patient. I like and value the man for his professional and human approach. ) I recommend it."
5360,"A doctor definitely worthy of recommendation and above all by vocation ! : - ) Our son had an operation on a nuclear warbler. The doctor's approach to the child at the highest level . It was the first time Cuba wasn't afraid of the doctor and he willingly went into the office alone . The course of the operation, communication with the parents before and after the operation was also at the highest level, so that we could be sure that Cuba is in good hands. The scar is beautifully healed. The day after the operation Dr Marek Kornet called to ask about his son's well-being, which also impressed me very much. Once again, we would like to thank the doctor for his professional care and recommend him to all parents who are looking for a very good pediatric surgeon. James' parents : - )"
5361,"As far as the restaurant is concerned, it is worth noting the very nice interior design, the very location of the hotel and its terrace. We did not use hotel services. The food itself is very nice looking on the plate, unfortunately, at most average in taste with small portions. Similarly, the staff did not follow some of the basic customs of a higher class restaurant. The restaurant is definitely not worth its price."
5362,"The doctor is not nice, I don't like visiting her (we are only in emergencies, because we are the closest ones). It is not true that the doctor is tired, he is an arrogant physician - we have a very keen pediatrician and she has never been so unpleasant. . . I have the impression that he is not looking at his daughter accurately and the only recommendations we got were smecta and elimination diet (which had nothing to do with the problem we came with). Despite this I am grateful to the doctor for taking the time when we needed a referral and she didn't let us go, she just made sure she couldn't give a specific one."
5363,"Margaret . 16 . 03 . 2017 Mrs Magda has found herself with an obesity problem . In the office I was greeted by a very nice young woman who immediately gained my trust . She did not feel embarrassed talking about my problem . After a thorough interview about my health, lifestyle and eating habits Mrs. Magda prepared a diet for me. The diet proved to be easy to prepare tasty meals. She also gave me a shopping list, which made my ""life"" much easier. The most important thing is that when I am on a diet I do not feel hungry and most importantly I do not feel like eating between meals. I highly recommend Mrs. Magda as a dietitian."
5364,"She was at your doctor's office with my baby. I cannot comment on the doctor's diagnosis as this will be verified by another examination for which I am enrolled, but I think it is necessary to pay attention to the uncultured and tactless behaviour of the doctor during the visit. I would like to point out that this was a private visit, for which I paid for it. The doctor was clearly in a hurry somewhere and took my child only 30 seconds of his precious time to make a diagnosis. She felt as if I was bothering him unnecessarily. He was spraying and wanted to get rid of me from the office as soon as possible. I am disappointed. It's probably important to treat the patient humanely. Children are not things."
5365,"""Professor Bandmann described the slow disappearance of the neurons that produce dopamine. This is exactly the same mechanism that causes the progression of the disease in humans. When 80 percent of such neurons disappear in a certain part of our brain, Parkinson's disease appears. In fish you can trace these pathological changes,"" explains the professor. So scientists are looking for ways to prevent them. They dissolve various substances in water and check whether they can stop or at least delay the disappearance of dopamine neurons. For many years there have been no new drugs for Parkinson's disease. The doses of the classic medicine must be gradually increased, and after a while they stop working."
5366,"The hotel is nice renovated, the water park is also nice only a pity with a bar on the water park area, animations - they try but as for me they are on a very low level, aqua gymnastics as the name says it should be in the water, the worst conducted activities I have ever been in my life. The repertoire every week is the same so don't eat for 2 weeks. Rooms, pool floor dirty. ( Somebody fell down the ice by the pool and dried up the bed for another 3 days) they seem to clean but the way of cleaning leaves much to be desired. The food for the first two days is ok but in the long run you can't eat it. It seems to be all but the bar is only open until 22:30 and not a minute longer, if you ask the bartender to make you some sweet drink from off-card, he will show you a jar for tips (if you give it to him and if not, you can only choose from a card and there you can choose from 5)."
5367,"It's basically more of a house than a hotel ( or rather ' bed and breakfast ' - B & B ) . Lonny and Thomas invite you to their house to live with them for a while. They create a family atmosphere and give the opportunity to relax and unwind. They will share their stories and give advice on tourism. The place is rather for socializing, the formalities of the hosts are kept to a minimum and they are always looking for opportunities for contact and conversation. As they themselves emphasize, they run ""the bed and breakfast"" because they like it and not for money. Prices for Switzerland are moderate, the rooms are clean, tidy with lots of shelves, drawers and lockers. Like the whole house kept in the old-fashioned style in its own climate. The room has a coffee machine, fresh fruit and chocolates. A small kitchen available to make tea or toast. Breakfast is full of choice for everything. You can ask your host for something special on hot. Various kinds of cheeses, muesli, flakes, nuts, bread spreads and the same bread, always crispy and fresh. Location well connected, bus station, railway station nearby, marina, market, restaurant nearby."
5370,"The lady at the reception desk, on the invoice signed as Edith. . . . . .unless she doesn't like her work. For a smile you probably have to pay her, because it doesn't come easily to her, no heat, customer service - very poor. The hotel is in the very centre of the city, so for screams until 4 am I won't complain because that's what you can expect. The room is clean, but when it comes to the corridors, the cleaning ladies could do a little more."
5371,"The doctor has a ""professorship"" approach to the patient - calm, balanced, and he seems to be well acquainted with the problem that the patient comes to him and knows what he does. The research has been carried out in a very thorough way, the doctor's friendly assistant is trying to reduce the patient's stress. For ok. For about 6 months, I've been struggling with a problem, there were 4 doctors with no great results. After the first visit to Dr. Brown. Walesa unblocked myself mentally, so much so that I feel less of my previous ailments. I still have to undergo surgery, but I believe that this will be the end of my problems. WZ"
5373,"Researchers from the Jagiellonian University have been monitoring more than 500 pregnant women and their children for dust exposure (in the form of particles with a diameter of 2,5 micrometers and smaller, PM2,5) since 2000. Such contaminants are particularly dangerous to health as they penetrate directly into the lungs. In recent days in Poland their acceptable standards have been significantly exceeded in many places. Newborn babies, whose mothers during pregnancy were exposed to higher air pollution, weighed less - on average by 128 g - than children exposed to lower pollution. The researchers noted that in this group of children, the so-called ""wheezing breath"" was more frequent in later periods of life, which is often connected with the appearance of asthma later on."
5374,"""The KZM is underestimated because the majority of the diseases occur in the eastern part of Poland"" - says prof. Zajkowska . Meanwhile, due to, among other things, climate warming - milder winters and warm humid summers - the expansion of ticks to new areas is observed and the related increase in the incidence of KZM. This applies to both Poland and other European countries. In 2015 there were 150 cases of this disease requiring hospitalization in Poland and in 2016 there were already 283 . According to prof . According to Professor Zajkowska, there were certainly many more cases of the disease, but not all of them are registered. When winter is mild, the season of tick activity starts already in March. ""When the temperature rises above 10 degrees Celsius. C all the characters of the tick feed simultaneously, and the youngest characters are even more dangerous,"" the specialist estimates."
5375,"She was occupying a room in the main building. The standard leaves much to be desired. Bathroom is very small, does not even have a shower cubicle, only a small shower tray with a molded curtain (I attach photos). The drain in the shower tray was clogged and while using the shower stood m after cubes in the water. Despite the fact that this problem has been reported to the receptionist, the drain has not been made accessible! Towels are not changed every day, but THIRTY DAYS! The beds are uncomfortable and are equipped with old, hard mattresses with springs. The advantage of my room was a nice view - a beautiful lime tree grew in front of the balcony. My room was adjacent to the reception and thanks to that I could use wireless internet. The location of the hotel is good. It takes about 5 minutes to get to the beach. The food is not very varied. The biggest problem was the very long waiting time for dinner. The dishes are chosen from the card. After almost an hour of waiting, the waiter's attention was drawn to it. Only after my second intervention (an hour and 15 minutes passed!) I received the ordered dish! The food was cold and the waiter forgot to bring cutlery! She complained to me at the reception, but instead of apologizing, the receptionist suggested that I contact the resident of TUI in order to ... change the hotel ! I do not recommend this hotel !"
5376,She's very sympathetic and willing to help and knows what she's talking about in this chemistry. The pass is easy .
5377,"Introduction to computer science, lecture Multimedia computer techniques, laboratories [ / b ] I recommend For formal reasons, my contact with Mrs. Radojewska was limited to the reception of the index with grades 4, 5 and 5, 0 which was no major problem even without special effort. Mrs. Beata, although she rarely smiles, has a sense of humor noticeable in the slides of the lecture or the content of the labs. I think she is completely fine."
5378,"A competent doctor and you can see that he is experienced. A factual and concrete approach to my case, i.e. listening, asking, analyzing the documentation and examining and clearly giving his opinion with an indication of what to do next. At the end I'll add some irrelevant information, but it's also worth mentioning because it doesn't ""sweeten"" it doesn't promise any miracles like that other people screwed something up and he'll do it well and such nice talking to the patient. That is, realistically - appropriate to the available possibilities, he assesses the situation and tells the patient what further action he sees. I think it was worth it, thank the doctor for the visit and I will continue to use his medical potential."
5379,"This hotel in reality looks different than in the pictures ! The floors are dirty stains of different color, under the bed of garbage such as: broken pen, bottle caps, hair comb, it found m under the bed! ! ! The bed is not comfortable mattress is soft sleeping in the hole, broken window which cannot be opened only from the top and you can suffocate yourself in the room from the heat! ! ! Bathroom is not hygienic fingerprints on the toilet paper flap I don't know if anyone has been poking their nose in before but it looked terrible! ! ! ! Breakfast is cleaned up under the nose where you have not yet eaten such a breakfast I have not eaten in any fucking hotel! ! ! Cards in the door don't work, you can fall asleep under the door : - ( I don't recommend it to anyone"
5380,"Very nice rooms, especially white and in the new part overlooking the park. Very well equipped, with bathrobes, cosmetics, coffee and tea making facilities. Location outside the center but in a charming place. If I'll ever be in Wroclaw, I'll come back there."
5382,"Dear Guests who came, we had a wedding in the restaurant Three Worlds Wedding and I really don't recommend this place to anyone. Admittedly, the building itself and the interior beautiful, convenient location - behind the fence of the church, but the staff is indescribable! You can safely say that we were robbed. We paid 220 PLN per person, so not little, and the food was as if it was a ""saving option"" - this is how one of our guests described it - which was a huge humiliation, because the ladies managing the building complained that it will be IDEALNIE! There was so little food that some guests shared the roulade! And for others there was not enough meat at all. They went hungry. We got almost nothing after the wedding, the staff was tragic, after the wedding we found our alcohols buried in the corners, the managing ladies are brazen! After a few days it turned out that on the day of the wedding there was no chef! ! ! ! How is it even possible to book a room a year earlier? ! I could write endlessly about their shortcomings or frauds, but I'm afraid there wouldn't be enough room. I also strongly advise against spoiling the most important day of people's lives and to spare the humiliation of parents organizing weddings."
5383,"Income from renting a room, apartment or house to tourists may be exempt from personal income tax under certain conditions. It is necessary that the building is located in a rural area, on a farm. In addition, no more than five rooms may be rented. If all these conditions are met, then you can benefit from the personal income tax exemption. If there is also food for tourists within the framework of these services, income from these services may also be exempt from tax, believes Katarzyna Rola - Stężycka, Tax Care company expert. What is important, all the above mentioned conditions must be kept and fulfilled together in order to be able to benefit from the exemption. This means that, for example, if a taxpayer bought a house with five rooms in the mountains in the countryside, but does not have a farm, he is not entitled to exemption."
5384,"I was at the doctor's after an accident with an aching spine, the doctors in the hospital found that it was a contusion but could not function normally. Dr. Breathalyzer ordered an X-ray and it turned out that there was a lowering of the circulatory disc between the corpuscles. . . And he gave me a referral for rehabilitation and explained what I can and can't honestly recommend this doctor"
5385,"I do not recommend this hotel. Dirty, poor food every day the same or what's left of yesterday was processed into some other dish and served for another day. I would have given this hotel 2 * I regret that I took all inc. Because even a drink we couldn't normally get just colored syrup. Alcohol's the worst and not drinkable. If I wanted a normal drifter, I had to pay. The pictures of the hotel are very different from reality. A very weak hotel really."
5386,"Course : Patent Information Evaluation : All right [ / b ] Mr. Kotarba is a very friendly and walking lecturer. There is a colloquium or work consisting in assessing the patentability of a selected invention, which takes a few hours and from the head. The lectures themselves are boring, and the pleasant voice of the professor + the afternoon hour made a lot of lectures slept with em: ) Presence is not checked . General: I recommend it, especially as it's human for 3 points: )"
5387,"Hostel in an excellent location at a very low price. The service is nice and helpful, there is no problem with leaving your luggage or checking in early. The Internet is flashing, nicely decorated common space with TV, nice and clean bathrooms. The price includes free flakes for breakfast (and free always cool:). The room is modest, but nice and clean. From the courtyard under the window a beer garden, which is a bit disturbing, but at the reception desk you can buy ear stoppers (great plus!). If you stay for a longer period of time you may lack a cabinet for hangers (there is a chest of drawers), but we just didn't need it. The only downside is that the bed is creaky with the slightest movement and the bed linen is a little bit longer. These are small downsides, I highly recommend to everyone!"
5388,"I was on a visit to Birkenau and I am pleased with the Doctor's approach. He carefully reviewed the results, answered questions and did not underestimate my ailments. He directed additional examinations to confirm the diagnosis. This is not the first visit to a gastrologist (I was with another one earlier), but Mr. Stańczyk made a professional impression on me."
5389,"Hello everyone , Dear patients it is good that in these times we have something like the internet thanks to whom if we want to express our opinion in this case finally about the people who save our lives. I value it and believe that no one would have any interest in writing untruthfully. Luckily, this lady didn't have to save me, but if she was in a difficult state and I would see her right away I would think I would be dead for a long time. I think it is important to warn each other and I have found out many times that the entry in the forums saved me in various areas of life, but I consider the health and treatment of patients to be more than just a building or a ""malfunction"". This lady should take an interest in the owners of the clinic, taking care of the expertise and professionalism of her department as well as the health of her paternity. After visiting this lady I will certainly no longer take advantage of the advice of the Doctor, we live in a civilized world and overlook the fact that the health service in Poland, which doctors commonly blame all the blame is something like understanding pacjeta, human approaches, medical ethics. I do not see any of the characteristics in this lady's actions, so my assessment is not in this ranking. Measurable, pathetic it just comes to my mind. I advise against it, I hope somebody will cheat their time because health for sure."
5390,"A hotel day is 20 hours. Extension to a full day cost almost 200 zł ( ! ) and we arrived at 18. 00 . ( We could be there till 11 . 00 ) . At the reception desk they are talking on the phone all the time and waiting several times for a few minutes we did not live to see the staff. She sent me an e-mail but got my answer after 26 hours, when we were gone. We couldn't sign up for morning classes and the salt cave. The saunas and pool were open at breakfast and dinner time. When we went to the pool after breakfast it was closed because the technical break was till 14. 00 and so on every day . . The saunas are closed until the evening. I chose the hotel that because of the pool but we were not allowed to swim. Small rooms. The bathroom smelled terribly smelly of cigarettes and the non-smoking room I made a complaint but they beat every argument of mine ( not very professional ) and did not apologize. In the garden, huge branches almost fell on our heads. For 430 PLN per day I definitely do not recommend! ! !"
5391,"I do NOT RECOMMEND, for me the phone is a failure, she bought it because she has read it on many forums that it is so mega cool, even excellent, usually good reviews and here for me it is a linden minus: camera hmm strange noises on the display after taking a picture as for 12 mpx very poorly, my galaxy s3 (8mpx) is taking beautiful pictures in comparison with this, mega cut touchscreen cap, not very intuitive phone as for a samsung, and about the battery not to mention fatal 1 day is a mountain with minimal use, The colors on the display are generally over-sweetened, very quickly and strongly heated up, and it's practically the whole back - as if it were normal, too light for me, such a toy, this aluminum frame around the hmm a little bit uncomfortable, problem with range, fingerprint scanner underdeveloped to the end often did not catch the advantages: Internet was going fast and smooth and texting was also faster, a cool option with pulse, steps and calories, she had 2 days and got rid of it :)"
5392,"The last time she asked me to see this doctor. He's a spray-headed, unpleasant, not very competent. I am in the fourth month of pregnancy, and the doctor for diarrhea ordered me to take 20 charcoal tablets at a time, for a cold he ordered me to drink as he expressed it with lime tree septica. When she asked me to be released with indignation, he answered so that she wouldn't go to work because pregnancy is not a disease. When she asked me what pills I can take for very severe headaches he was outraged that he wanted to take any medication. I definitely do not recommend this gynaecologist."
5393,"The hotel has clean but tiny bathrooms, especially shower cabins. The food is not tasty, a very small choice in addition to the cold and for supper, a beaker of dan from breakfast and lunch. Dirty dishes, we have repeatedly come across dirty glasses with tea deposits or lipstick. The staff at the reception desk is not very nice, especially such an old grandmother. Only friendly and smiling bartenders. I generally do not recommend this hotel because of the service and the hotel itself that is suitable for renovation."
5394,"He was expecting me, as usual, to be something like a hotel. However, the nice staff at the reception desk made me feel better. The more so as the hotel has a large parking lot not only for cars but also a separate space for buses. 50 m from the hotel market globe. The hotel is quite ""substantial"" in terms of size. The room that occupied em turned out to be worth 4 * and at 100% 3,5 . Clean, warm internet ' HULA ' TV standard for Germans respect each other, Italians and Russians. I sincerely recommend and so far the hotel is in my top ten, my modest ranking . On a scale from 1 to 10 large 6 ."
5395,"Encouraged by positive opinions, she decided to spend the night in the Ritowisk, expecting tasty, homemade food, interesting interior design and pleasant atmosphere. For dinner we were given dry bread and cooked poor quality sausage, for breakfast dry bread, calculated slices of poor quality cold meat and a small portion of scrambled eggs. In the room that we received, the heating was not working and it was very cold, the lady from the staff was reluctant to change our room for another one. Both rooms were dirty, with random, not matching furniture. There was an unpleasant smell everywhere. Aesthetic and dirty rooms. Electricity and plumbing in the rooms were made very amateurishly, live cables on top, everywhere extensions and switches and sockets installed in quite accidental places. Everything for a price comparable to much higher standard hotels in Supraśl. Only late arrival time and tiredness of travel caused me to decide to stay there for one night. I strongly advise against it."
5396,"No elevator, cramped room, uncomfortable bed, stink in the room, no shampoo and, attention, attention - no hot water! ! ! For breakfast a small selection of dishes, some cold meats not fresh. Tasty scrambled eggs for consolation. It is not even about the ratio of price to quality, I simply do not recommend at all!"
5397,"We were in this hotel twice during the winter holidays in 2017 and 2018. I have the impression that from year to year the hotel is even better. The rooms are great, cleaned daily, clean towels, delicious food in huge quantities. The opportunity to enjoy a wonderful spa and salt cave . Great swimming pools and saunas. Very good location of the hotel - close to the beach. Possibility to enjoy a lot of entertainment at the hotel - bowling, billiards. Daily activities for children and adults. I highly recommend the Grand Lubicz Hotel."
5398,"""The uniqueness of this room is that it is entirely for children. It is also unique that it will be able to perform interventional cardiology and conventional, typical surgical procedures at the same time, which will shorten the time of the procedure"" - said Maciej Kowalczyk, Director of the University Children's Hospital. He expressed his belief that all the hospital's more difficult patients will be admitted to the hybrid room. In turn, the head of the hospital's cardiac surgery and intensive cardiac care ward, prof . Janusz Skalski emphasized that ""thanks to Radio Zet Foundation the hospital can have the most modern hybrid room in Poland and probably in Europe"" . ""Because there are such rooms, but they are designed for adults. Not for children . It was not believed that a hybrid room for children would be needed. At the moment we know that for the most complex defects in children this hybrid room is even more necessary than in adults, and maybe most of all for such patients it is necessary because thanks to these modern devices you can do less harm and help more"" - said prof . Skalski ."
5399,"A child of this age can also try a little bit of Christmas, roasted meats and cured meats, provided that they are cooked on their own, with a little salt. If we give him/her stuffed eggs, the filling should be for example roasted salmon, boiled fish or vegetables. Dishes with raw eggs, e.g. cold cheesecake or homemade mayonnaise, should also be avoided by pregnant women. A safer solution will be hard-boiled eggs or eggs in the form of heavily cut scrambled eggs, eggs stuffed with fish or vegetables. ""Eating raw eggs, meat or fish carries the risk of Salmonella infection. All diseases requiring pharmacological treatment are too risky for the health of a child in the womb"" - stresses the PAP interlocutor."
5400,"Neutralin, I'm approaching the evaluation, Doctor. . . She is not very nice, you have to ask her about everything, otherwise she uses professional, unclear terms and you do not know what is happening to a person. . . . . She is also spraying, obviously she doesn't want to help the patient, she wants to sell her out and get out of her head."
5401,"Hotel in a very neglected standard. Dirty and sticky. Breakfasts are terrible and also dramatically served in an unaesthetic way deterring the guest. Rooms with moving vermin and definitely to renew the bathrooms . The service is very nice and helpful although it can not compensate for the whole hotel. Even the location or maybe even the location is also unfavorable. Away from the center and the rest of the city . On the railway, the main route . Loud and far away. I don't recommend it to anyone."
5402,"Greetings! She wanted to share her opinion on Dr. Fudalej. I must admit that from the very beginning, Dr. Fudalej has a fully professional approach ! He immediately presented me with a treatment plan, including how long it will last : ) ) ) She was wearing two braces (top and bottom) and went without tearing her teeth out - where other doctors first wanted to do it! Among people dissatisfied with Dr. Piotr's treatment, there will always be some ""black sheep"" - so I advise you to go and see for yourself how the doctor really treats - I am very satisfied! ! ! I recommend it with a clear conscience !"
5403,"She's been treating me for several years. Unfortunately without positive results . I am not a simple patient (a serious chronic neurological disease) and it takes at least a little effort to treat me. Mr. docent Milewicz never remembered to treat me, nor which patient I am, what to watch out for. He prescribes me a dozen or so packs of the medicine immediately, regardless of the effects and interactions. After the packaging was finished, he stated that it did not work and he prescribed another one, and I was left with a spare for the whole regiment! After an extremely complicated operation, which he carried out really fantastically ( ! ! ! ! ) this time he forgot to prescribe me the medicine and the whole effort was taken by the devil. At the check-up visit, irritated by his own mistake, he still shouted at me and wrote me out more miracles in large supply, falling asleep three times during the discharge of my wedding. I strongly advise against it."
5404,"I recommend , course interesting : ) At the end, a speech in front of the camera (on any subject, no longer than 3 - 4 minutes.), which is later analyzed in 4 eyes with the leader. Learning everything you need to communicate. These are exercises, so you need to speak and do something, but the classes are cool, interesting."
5406,"There have been changes since the last stay, a little for the better. New piers, hard quay, barbecue shed. So much is being done but let's get to the details: - The rooms are cleaned only after the guests leave - that is, a trashcan full of toilet paper - poured hangers for toilet paper - no shelf (torn) under the shower - unwashed bed linenWere concerned about the standard room. Lighting in the room is probably from two 25W light bulbs and the end - half dark - tiring. One key to the room and if you are two, what then? - Problem, you have to walk together everywhere. The food is said to be tasty but I did not like it. You have to wait for breakfast to fill the Swedish table. You can see the enormity of work and since I was there 3 years ago, I can see the difference. It is certainly cleaner . As a starting point very good place . One found if someone would come there I recommend the apartment only not in part over the kitchen - too loud."
5407,"On the website of the Primavera Hotel I found a holiday offer for senior citizens as the lowest price - 1043 PLN - 7 nights in a double room. It was a very attractive offer so she decided to book a room. She called me to the hotel . The lady at the reception informed me that they do not have such a package for this price. She took her out of the mistake of telling me where she found me such an offer. The lady entering the hotel's website was in heavy shock when she saw such an offer informing me that it was an error and she would not accept the reservation for the price specified on the hotel's website. She could not agree with you. If such an offer was placed by an employee of the hotel, I should make a reservation for such an amount. The lady at the reception did not listen to my arguments and did not accept the reservation. She asked me if I would be able to make a reservation on the internet for the price as it is on the website of the lady at the reception desk, and she informed me that if I could make a reservation, yes. The offer from the website was quickly removed and I could not make a booking online. I think that this should not happen and the reservation should be made for the price from the website. DISCOUNTS! ! ! As a proof I attach a photo of the offer from the hotel website. I managed to do it before the offer was removed."
5408,"We used to go to Mrs. Pauline's for marriage therapy. She spent a lot of time in and out of the office, but that's a big plus. At the end of the meetings Mrs. Paulina turned out to be biased, she could not control the course of meetings, she did not feel the needs of her patients, she did not stick to her principles. This led, among other things, to the end of the meetings and to a summary of the several years of the relationship in one sentence. Finally, to top it all off, she suggested mediation: ) Mrs. Paulino started to fight for our relationship on her own, but I will tell you that this is a heavy bread, when the other person was confirmed by you about the absence of her faults and about the fact that she did everything she could (and she did not). It was me who brought my husband to you, but she would never have done it to me again if she had known that it would end like this."
5409,"Jaco day 2013-09-21 00 : 03 : 34 bought 'em M 39 with speakers and as it turned out at home one channel was damaged . He gave 'em back and after 4 days they sent a new set . He plugged 'em in like ok, but when he gave 'em 20, he turned off the power after less than 1 song. This fault is not how to play quieter or about 10 weaves . But the M39's volume range is probably up to 45. That's half the power, something's happening to it. Tomorrow I'm going to give it back, but it's starting to annoy me. The quality of the equipment is like Chinese Christmas lights from Castorama. If it's playing, it's sounding as good as it gets. But the fear of what will happen in 2 years' time. A note from today. He took 'em packed boxes of hardware to an online store that is apricots and the guy didn't believe it was broken and checked it carefully and admitted it to me. He didn't even ask em for cash and he took out the money and returned it . Some paperwork signed 'em. So he behaved like he was. Now I'm in the dot what to buy in that cash register. I'm thinking of CS 555 ONKYO. Maybe this equipment won't fall apart right away!"
5410,"Dr. Szewczuk was leading my pregnancy and I'm very pleased. She wanted me to force the C-section because I was 44 years old and she was very afraid for the baby in particular. Dr. Szewczuk kept making sure that I would give birth to a healthy baby by nature and he was right. I do not believe in Dr. Szewczuk's bad intentions towards Mrs. Gosia, who, as Dr. Szewczuk writes, gave birth to a healthy baby. The ""postnatal shock"" is gone, the pain will be forgotten when you watch your beloved child grow up, and when you are pregnant again, please do not go to Dr. Szewczuk, because your place will surely be taken by another mother, who will be satisfied and grateful to Dr. Szewczuk like me :) ."
5411,"Hi. I recommend the medicine . dent . Gregory Shumilas . My catastrophic eight ripped out zero pain after the removal of the wisdom tooth, and it was huge and as other doctors said to rip under anesthesia on the jaw in Wroclaw (Mr. Szumilas managed it on six with a plus) . Thank you very much for my one and showing that the previous dentist was doing my root canal treatment but forgot to fill the canals. I recommend the services of this doctor is very high quality, there is a very nice and friendly atmosphere in the office: ) . I live in DE at the moment, but how to treat teeth is only in G office. Shumilas ! ! ! ! ! !"
5412,"The hotel is beautifully located and that's it. The hotel has a total mess, dirty rooms, molded, no towels, bed linen not replaced. No water refilled in the bar. Lack of organization, the staff is hanging around the executioners, the dirty dishes are lying in the corridors for two or three days and then they are moved to another place, the food is not very varied, cold, the staff does not add food so when you come for a meal later it does not stay much. The tables in the dining room are sticky with dirt and the tablecloths look like they've been pulled out of your throat. There are not enough deckchairs, mattresses, no beach towels at all. The beds and mattresses are torn and broken. No real animation and what we were offered was thin. The hotel deserves not 5 stars but only 2. At the reception desk in case of any problems, the staff pretends not to understand any language except Turkish. And there is one big construction site around the hotel. All the more reason to leave with the children, no lifeguard on the beach, no attractions for children."
5413,"The hotel is centrally located, but you can't hear the street noise. There are many advantages: the interior is decorated with taste, the 5 + deserves a nice service, clean rooms and other hotel rooms! Breakfast is varied. Prices are preferential compared to the hotel standard. In addition, the hotel does a nod to the regular guests and offers them discounts - e.g. 10 PLN less for further stays: ) I'm still planning on staying there on a business trip !"
5414,"Hotel overrated . Small rooms . In July terribly stuffy and hot . No air conditioning . Many people opened the balcony door and entrance door at the same time to cool the rooms. No kettle and phone in the room . From the balcony view of the rooftops and the eternally buzzing equipment . Room rarely and very poorly cleaned . Ugly, damaged linen. Cups "" duralex "" not once washed . The tiny bathroom. Safe in the room additionally paid! ! ! ! There is no way to get the key to the room without paying the total price of the stay. Now I understand why ? ! She would gladly give up this hotel after the first day of her stay. Long and steep descent to the beach ."
5415,"Very pleasant course, you can move around a bit (sometimes interesting games as a warm-up) and learn a few attitudes to perform various techniques in Aikido, of course for one semester you can not learn anything concrete but as a prelude or as a curiosity is very cool. It is also worth adding that Mr. Piotr will often make the students tired, but that's probably what wf is all about - to make a little bit of a mistake :) The credit for attendance, the initial grade is 5, you can have two absences but each of them is a grade down, but you can make up for the absences at any time (only he leads the classes with Aikido), he only has to come, practice and after the classes report that he has made up his mind and is already: )"
5416,"On the good side, it's probably just a location. All the rest, unfortunately, very poorly. I do not know how in large rooms with a few people but in private without a bathroom drama. You can feel a little like in a cell. Toilets generally clean but you had to e.g. ask for toilet paper. Without writing, generally completely discouraged. Especially for this price."
5417,"Unfortunately, not everything looks like the pictures. On good morning our daughter hit a pole standing almost in the middle of the biggest apartment. The pole is unprotected and has sharp edges. As for the center focused on the family and children is a bad idea. They made a phone call to the reception but it turned out that there is neither a doctor nor a first aid kit in such a big centre! The wound looked dangerous and blood was spilling. So we stayed alone with the problem and called the emergency room. It turned out that we had to take our daughter to the hospital. In the hospital the wound was stitched ( three stitches ) Generally nobody from the settlement was impressed by our phone or the ambulance. We will probably leave the matter to a lawyer. The apartment should have been painted long ago. Dirty walls kitchen equipment embarrassing . Pool tragedy . A lot of people dirty and smelly. . . Nobody on the current one cleans the pool so all the shit from the floor flows into the Jacuzzi. Nobody from the staff cares about the sauna area . The effect is that the saunas are entered by people who are not washed in their bathing suits, so staying in them can only threaten illness. In the cloakroom, the floor shit and a disgusting smell . For three restaurants operated one SnuffyCenes from outer space the amount of food wasted . You can eat pork chops there for 42 PLN . Breakfast is good but at the weekend with more people there is no room in the main restaurant so guests are directed to the lower part of the rooms for conference rooms. There the level is much lower when it comes to decoration and there is no good coffee machine like in the main restaurant so we do not drink capucino. It's a pity because the place was supposed to be cool and relaxed and there is disappointment."
5418,"The hotel is located just off the road and close to the airport, but it is not a nuisance. It's clean, although the hotel is already old. Rooms are cleaned daily, including changing towels and bed linen. Good location, considering the rounded landscape - the bay, the St. Peter's peninsula and the city. The hotel is located in a valley town. The hotel's swimming pool is subject to daily maintenance. Good intercity communication of SAM company . Available application for mobile devices . Average uniform continental breakfasts . Dinners at a higher level, but rather in a three-star standard . Nevertheless recommendable if luxury is not expected."
5420,"Bottom, first of all a dirty carpet (not washed) . No WASHING and VOICE, as for * * * * is a massacre . They come later on to dinner NO WASHING and DISCOUNTING ! ! ! NO CLAIMING IN THE ROOM AND IN THE HOTEL ! ! ! Get to the hotel by the "" field "" SPA to BANI ! ! !"
5421,"The hotel has visited em a few times already. Still and constantly high level of service . Business advantages: easy to reach, large parking lot, fast internet, desk in the room. Tourist advantages: Wieliczka outside the window and Krakow is very easy to reach by train, which also goes right outside the window. Attention sceptics: the hotel windows do not overlook the tracks, so there is no noise. I also appreciate the fact that the rooms are large and interestingly decorated. And finally, the most important thing: if you manage to meet the owner, you have a chance to feel like a visit to friends and not in a ""cold"" hotel. I strongly recommend it, I come back and I always worry if there will be free rooms! ps . If someone does not like the hotel VERY GOOD food he has a shop under his nose and in the room there is a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities."
5422,"Hotel prices in European cities are falling dramatically, even compared to the huge falls during the 2008-2010 recession. Rooms in Prague are 37 percent cheaper. The Los Angeles Times newspaper reports that rooms in Prague are 31% cheaper than in 2011, according to Hotwire.com. The high drop is due to several factors: excess hotel rooms after the London Olympics, the problems of the European economy and the weakening of the euro, as well as the typical price cuts for the industry, explains Clem Bason, president of the Hotwire group. Bason points out that, according to Hotwire, Paris, Barcelona and Rome have the lowest hotel prices in over five years, while air fares to Berlin, Dublin and Helsinki have fallen by 13 percent. . According to Hotwire's boss, a similar situation occurred in Canada after the Vancouver Games."
5423,"Booking for this hostel made 'em through booking.com and the price was extremely friendly despite the high season. It is located on the 4th floor of a building in the center of Warsaw. My room was located near a corner with washing machines and dryers so it was a little noisy, but I didn't mind. The room was freshly renovated and clean, I liked its decor. All in all, it was good. I recommend it."
5424,"Me and my whole family and friends had stomach problems all the time. A few children ended up in hospital. The room was cleaned once in two weeks. There's something going away everywhere. Towels and bed linen not mentioned at all even after the intervention of the resident. Eating like the dreadful things I wrote 'em before. Besides, the constant struggle for a seat at the table . A lot to write . . . . In a nutshell, if you have any other alternative, don't choose this place."
5425,"They spent a week in the apartment. A view of the wall and stones on the pseudo terrace . The TV in the bedroom on the side wall is impossible to watch . The radiators in the bathroom don't work. Cosmetics not supplemented , reception slicked Mr. Tragic and snout, no help with bringing luggage, tragedy parking, wifi tragedy, noise from the kitchen, canteen and not restaurant, cold at the pool. Swimming pool tracks super, tasty food, too much salt especially in soups for children. Nice waitresses and ladies cleaning outside of the slicker from the reception. To sum up, this is a hotel for families and pensioners from Germany (60%) who came for medical treatments, generally a nice place but not in the 5 star standard. The best is a bar by the window to the pool where grandparents sit and watch the young mums and the first floor is empty, maybe it is worth to develop this place there. . ."
5427,"Basically, during the whole visit, the doctor was pasting something into the computer and did not say anything. She sat down and looked at the wall, waiting for all the test results to be transcribed into the computer. I have had Hashimoto for 2 years, I already have some knowledge about this disease, so I was surprised when the doctor considered TSH = 7 to be ""slightly elevated, because the norm is up to 4"". especially since I'm 27 years old and maybe I'll be planning a baby in no time. That way I could lose it quickly, and I guess that's not the point. . . She wanted me to take an alternate dose of medicine for a few months, which she didn't agree to. The only plus was an ultrasound during the visit, which is useful once in a while. An additional disgust aroused the fact that in the pharmacy she paid m for the drug 3 times more than before because she generously wrote out a 100% paid prescription, knowing that a pack of 2x50 Euthyrox tablets is refunded and she would pay m for them about 6 PLN as before. I recommend if someone wants to go only after the prescription but if someone is going to ask questions and wants to get an answer, then you have to look for another doctor because the doctor is not very talkative."
5428,"The hotel is very high. Clean and large rooms. The service is helpful and there is no problem with getting along in English. Very good breakfasts! The hotel has a swimming pool, gym and bar on the 20th floor overlooking Batumi and the sea, which is 50m away. Not far from the long promenade where there are many attractions! Fountains, souvenir shops, food stalls and ice cream stands. I recommend it ! ! !"
5429,"A typical guesthouse that looks nice only in description. The rooms are in terrible condition, some of them have only small tilt windows, beds are small and uncomfortable. The distances to the sea etc. are not true either. It says that 1,5 km, it's really 2,5 km, to Gdanska 31 km, but it doesn't say that this route goes by ferry, because normally the street is about 50 km. You can see that the landlord has a ""catch a deer"" rule. with such an approach, not hostile to success."
5430,"I do not recommend ! ! ! ! ! ! The defective sofa was delivered to us and the same day the shop assistant took it for replacement. After three weeks, the same couch was brought back to us without removing its defects. The third time we were provided with a perfect and replaced piece of furniture, we were brought by a company transport directly from the Bydgoszcz factory - and again they took the sofa because again: the modules in the line of the backrest were not equal, the upholstery of individual elements unevenly sewn, the height of the elements uneven - the service technicians themselves found something wrong with it! ! ! ! ! The couch returned to the factory. After three weeks, the factory sent a letter saying that the sofa is not faulty only after each getting up the seat should be properly formed and if we do not collect the sofa they will charge us with the storage costs. Case to the Consumer Ombudsman! ! ! ! ! !"
5431,"After a long walk in the mountains until you want to eat something warm and good, but the dishes are not tasty (tomato soup, borscht with tragedy ears) and the prices are too high. The hostel has its own climate, but what not that would have to change."
5432,"Professional, competent specialist, expert in the difficult subject of fertility problems. This is the shortest way to describe Mrs. Iza. Her calmness, professional knowledge, approach to man helped me to get on my feet and after the therapy was finished, I realized how badly she was in a condition I was reporting to Empathy. Seemingly ordinary meetings, filled mostly with my monologue, interspersed with comments and apt assessment of Ms. Iza's situation restored balance, joy of life, allowed me to accept reality as it is. I wholeheartedly recommend Mrs. Iza, especially as an expert in the aspect of fertility problems."
5433,"I live in Lagiewniki and was looking for a place to organize a birthday party for 22 people. She decided to take advantage of the offer that she received from the Manager of the Lorenzo Hotel Mrs. Annie . I have to admit that the party exceeded my expectations. The food was delicious and well served, the service was very nice and professional. The guests were delighted and to this day congratulate you on choosing a place to party. She would like to thank the whole hotel staff for their professionalism, kindness and commitment. The prizes proposed by Ms. Anna in the karaoke contest in the form of figures from Belgian chocolate turned out to be a hit! ! ! We recommend the Lorenzo Hotel as a place to organize intimate events. Agata and Witek"
5434,"There were 'em in this place both in the hotel and the restaurant, during the weekend trips. Unfortunately, both the hotel stay and the restaurant leave much to be desired. High prices in an ideal place for sailors, nothing special, without the claw of aesthetics. The restaurant is not even protected by a terrace near the water. The Indian soup has been tasty for months, while the rest is wordless, tasteless and by name we can guess what we are eating. It's a pity, because the place deserves to be unique."
5436,"The neighborhood is beautiful and with great potential. A lot of attractions for children, as well as a pool and saunas. Unfortunately, 3 things broke down the whole impression: - Breakfast instead of a nice moment is a nightmare, too few places, lack of food, queues, fighting for the only coffee distributor - the staff is not interested in hotel guests, the guest feels like an intruder, for example. The guest restaurant is closed in front of the client's nose at 8:00 p.m. because there are not enough guests and at the entrance he writes till 10:00 p.m. - ""Dog-friendly hotel"" is just a slogan without any cover, in fact many restrictions are imposed. 4 hotel stars in total is an exaggeration, max poor 3."
5437,"Urbanski Krzysztof, PhD Course: Languages of programming (lecture and project) Evaluation: I recommend [ / b ] Interesting man - despite his academic title he has not forgotten what it is like to be a student, and therefore he tries not to be free from the force and treats failures with humour. The lecture is conducted rather from a purely practical point of view - it discusses code fragments, which can be copied to your project without fear. Colloquia are difficult if you have not prepared yourself (i.e. you have not found a person who will write you answers to the examples given before the wheel). Please note that Mr. Urbanski does not like to pursue this VERY. It is also worth visiting his test page - he always writes down the most interesting excerpts from the work of people who have not prepared themselves and comments on them accordingly.)"
5438,"I was also finally impressed by the doctor who had a little contact with her, but he was the only doctor who behaved professionally in relation to me, when she had the dubious pleasure of getting to the Orłowski hospital. The doctor cares about the good of the patient and I think that this should be a priority for the doctor since he became a doctor. . . .but that's not always the case. I'm sure she also cares about her patients, who are taken to the hospital where she works to take care of them comprehensively, she informed me that she had the opportunity to observe, I was not a patient of the doctor's, but thanks to such people, she still remains a little bit convinced that the good of the patient is important regardless of where and with whom he is treated and whether his case is more or less serious. After her stay in the hospital she read a lot of opinions about doctors because until now she didn't have to look for a good gynaecologist because everything was always ok and as you know the stairs start only then when something happens she didn't know that it's so difficult to find a good doctor and the girls write that they change doctor several times before they find the right person and in my opinion the doctor. She is such a person and although she personally found a different gynaecologist, I think that she is also a good doctor and an expert in her field."
5439,"Hello He was 'em with his wife and grandson on winter holidays from 16 . 01 . - 29 . 01 . 2016 at ASTOR Hotel in Jastrzębia Góra . Rating is very good, the hotel is prepared for the children's stay and not only in 100%, the service starts at the reception desk, i.e. Ms. Krysia and Mr. Marcin, and ends with the gym, swimming pool, cleaners, cooks, and waiters. Not forgetting the children's entertainers, i.e. Mrs. Lusia and Mrs. Ewa, these ladies are professionals in every way, it is impossible to get bored when children play. Besides, they are clean, nice and tasty like little else. We highly recommend this hotel, it is worth resting there, you can't get bored even though the season is long over. We will come back there for sure"
5440,"The tasks performed in the class in a similar form appear on the wheel. The doctor answers all students' questions and has a lot of patience to correct them. She explains exactly the same as in the lecture, sometimes even in a more accessible way. Thanks to her, she did not have to take the exam from Analysis I ; )"
5441,"Treatment in Madurovich does not make much sense if you do not go to a private office of one of the local doctors, in particular Mr. Suzin, who will not even take a second to ""foreign"" patients. After 4 days of lying in the hospital no one was even acquainted with my case and the doctor made bad diagnoses, which were feared by his other hospital specialists confirmed without hesitation. An unpleasant system: ("
5442,"At the beginning of September the son with haematomas on his thigh after several consultations with other doctors with a deadline for surgery. The boy attends sports school, the procedure that was to be performed would immobilize him for a few months. As a last resort, we asked for a consultation with Dr. Urban. . A wonderful eloquent man, full of commitment through rehabilitation treatments cured the young man within 10 days. The boy returned to further training without any problem and most importantly without surgical intervention. We are very pleased that we came across such an outstanding specialist with respect and thanks to grateful parents."
5444,"I RECOMMEND ! ! ! infa cw 1 grandmother is awesome, I recommend to easily pass it and even get a good grade: )"
5445,"It's a pleasure to be with this gentleman, but you have to walk, because you have 5 to attend. However, it does not create problems with making up for the absence, because it has a lot of deadlines, if you have signed up for a deadline which for some reason does not fit, you can always come in another after you have agreed it with him. I recommend it again!"
5446,"Yesterday he bought 'em a c175 camera. In my opinion it is a webcam only for personal laptop because of very short power cable . For a desktop computer, if you don't have it under your monitor, you have to buy an extension cord. The mounting of this webcam on the monitor borders on a miracle because the bracket it has is designed so that it is not suitable for anything, to mount it stable I ordered em Velcro fasteners for gluing because otherwise it is not stable and every now and then you need to improve it because it rotates itself together with the mount. The program to operate the webcam I pulled down from the internet (no CD) but when unpacking it twice it also hung up and gave 'em peace of mind and I'm waiting for a colleague computer specialist can do something about it. As for the beginning it's probably too many problems."
5447,"Apparently good, unfortunately, she didn't notice the m . She had a knee arthroscopy performed by this gentleman twice. Unfortunately the doctor turned out to be, to say the least, as you know the arthroscopy is performed under anesthesia in the spine, I got m in the groin and as if that wasn't enough he didn't hit the nerve and she felt everything m, and as she told him m lying on the table that it hurts he just ignored me. I guess it was only thanks to the nurse who said nice things to me, somehow she kept m . After the treatment, I was fine, but I had some extremely ugly scars. ``The evaluation was zeroed. Reason: The doctor above explained the situation. ` ` `"
5448,"Unfortunately, I cannot share the flattering opinions about P . Doctor . Plus for being polite, he is able to calm down and at the same time put the vigilance to sleep. He underestimated many issues despite my requests, he did not respond to my concerns in time, so now I have health problems and this could have been prevented. It's a pity, it's a great pity especially that she trusted me with this doctor. . . ."
5449,"She was m before and during the holiday season. Before the season was fantastic. The room got m as she wanted m . The view is beautiful . . . . .although I was a little disappointed by the disorder on the balcony ( swallows are doing their job ) . During the season the hotel was terribly besieged, which could be felt everywhere. At breakfast, half an hour of standing behind scrambled eggs. A few minutes of looking for a free table . The water in the indoor swimming pool is cloudy. There are no deck chairs in the outdoor swimming pool. In the season I will definitely not go there. Especially since the promised room also didn't get the m ."
5450,"I confirm the opinion that even on a private visit the doctor is strange: he does not allow the patient to talk about his pain, he speaks quietly and unclearly, writing on the keyboard at the same time. He cards the patient like a schoolboy when he answers too long! Nothing explains anything to the patient. He wants to receive the patient in a quarter of an hour for 120 PLN - quickly! Although I admit that the recorded treatments were well aimed at eliminating my health problem. But I will not go to this doctor again!"
5452,"The first orthopaedic doctor to examine and diagnose me at all. Earlier, and ""I've been treating myself"" for several years, they didn't even look at me. But these were visits within the NFZ, which explains a lot. Your doctor chose me on the basis of the descriptions on this portal, and after the first visit I think it is a very good choice ."
5454,"On her six cats she tested m different gravels, and I definitely stay with it. It was beautifully clumped, but you have to remember that the layer of gravel in the tray was not too thin. Absolutely eliminates the cat's stench. It leaves the smell of wood. For me with such a flock as mine, it is very important that used lumps can be thrown into the toilet. They immediately disintegrate in the water and easily flow down into the toilet. The only downside is that long-haired cats sometimes carry some gravel on their fur outside the litter tray. But that's probably all the gravels they have, even those in the form of rollers. It has already used up over 500 liters and has just opened another bag for me."
5455,"I'm 42 years old. I've been to several gynaecologists in my life. Mrs. Sokołowska is - so far - the only gynaecologist who did not write a prescription for contraceptives, for which she came to her by accident. She was very carefully examined by me. I even noticed very visible veins on my legs, which no doctor had noticed before! She was given a referral for a test, the results of which were to help match the best contraception for me. She did the tests but only after 4 months. With the results she was sent to another doctor - unfortunately Mrs. Sokołowska does not work in my health center anymore - a great pity! A very nice gynaecologist looked at the results and asked about the purpose of the visit. The answer ""I ask for a prescription. . . . ""...asked for which measure? She was wondering about the pills, then the rings. . . . The charming gentleman said that he could prescribe me anything I wanted and actually as much as I wanted. And as for the helpful test results... . . . . Well, they were normal, as he said. The visit lasted 7 minutes. So she took my prescription, thanked me, realized me. . . After the next one I will report to Ms Sokołowska with the results of the tests she gave the referral for. I hope that they will be useful! I also know that I will not have to be alone - despite the presence of the doctor! - wondering which method will be the best for me! I highly recommend a visit to Mrs. Sokołowska ."
5456,"The location of the hotel is not attractive at all. Around the holiday plot and a large wedding hall construction. The decoration of the restaurant and color make quite a depressing impression. During the weekend of May, the buffet formula of both breakfast and dinner has not worked at all. Only a few dishes were served in small quantities, which you had to ""hunt"" or ask the waiters to report. In one evening the ""attraction"" was the grill! That is sausages, black pudding, etc. In the second evening, the attraction ""Italian evening"" was proposed with the so-called ""cooking show"", where every guest had to stand in line for pasta, in the fumes of smoke and smells of roasted garlic, shrimps or onions. Besides, there was nothing else to eat. When we left at the reception desk we couldn't very much account for our stay, still something was added or subtracted, finally after a week of stay the account was sent to an email. Of course, higher than the offer we got before our arrival. In a word, I do not recommend this hotel!"
5457,"The worst place I've been, the owner of the mega-rude and not nice, the food is very poor, with vegeta on you probably are. The rooms are terrible, creaky floor, cold in the rooms, cigarette stench, dirty curtains, bedding is probably from 8 seasons lying there, massacre, bypass the wide gap, rip-off in the white day, you would have to send there sanitary and tax office because even a receipt fiscal receipt I did not get and for which I asked twice and for the room your landlady will ask 330 PLN per day, scandal! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
5459,"I applied to Dr. Justin Bogusha in March this year because I was not satisfied with the diagnosis found by the laryngologist from the hospital in Chorzow. The doctor from Chorzów examined me and gave me a referral for CT. In fact, he did not explain his decision after seeing the photo, but only said that I should go for two surgeries: the correction of the nasal septum curve and the second one consisting in the removal of polyps from two maxillary sinuses. After the visit to Dr. Bogusz, I had the impression that the doctor paid a lot of attention to the examination and its quality. After a few visits I managed to determine the real cause: the causal tooth and the resulting cyst (also after consultation with the dentist and surgeon). After the surgery, the pain, swollen face and probably a slight internal inflammation, but two weeks, a clear improvement! High level of service and reliability are the biggest advantages in diagnosing by the Doctor. I will probably have to verify the right maxillary sinus, but I will have no doubt to go again to this laryngological expert. The Doctor's words are soldierly, but he speaks concretely and makes things clear as the sun. I have nothing left to do but to recommend the services of Dr. Bogusha! Greetings Tom K ."
5460,"Unfortunately a big misunderstanding, we had a two bedroom apartment for four adults and one baby, we got two narrow quilts, two pillows, two towels. It's just that I'm reporting a problem with the amount of bedding to the receptionist in the evening, but unfortunately he can't help it. The hotel requires a general overhaul of the whole together with the restaurant and the management. The hotel seems to be family-friendly but that was a long time ago."
5461,"""The surface of burnt skin has a temperature lower than that of healthy skin, which is related to its damage and metabolic atrophy"" - explains prof . Ewa Majchrzak . During the healing process these temperatures equalize . On the other hand, the knowledge of the difference in these temperatures makes it possible to diagnose the burn itself"" - she says . The first degree of burn is not dangerous, just a cold compress. With the third degree of burn, the matter is also clear, because there is tissue carbonization and there are not many treatment options. However, the biggest problem is for doctors with second degree burns. ""In this case the doctor must decide whether the tissue should be cut out surgically or treated. The possibility of differentiating the degree of the burn in this case is a key issue in deciding how much tissue can be saved"" - explains the researcher. IR Diagnostics can be used not only to diagnose burn wounds, but also to imaging the healing of other difficult and extensive wounds, e.g. diabetic wounds, in which there is also a temperature difference."
5462,"Hotel neat, clean . Comfortable rooms . Good food . I recommend ala carte . I also recommend the spa, high quality treatments. Minus for two things. During the stay there were no swimming pools 3 days! - They informed only at the reception desk. The fact that we have received compensation in the form of free beach chairs and water equipment. The second minus - very expensive fees for the beds, up to 50zl per day (for the best). The bottom of the private beach is completely covered with algae. Generally I recommend a short trip to relax away from the city, although in my opinion it is not worth too long a route (I had 400km). If they had improved the quality of the private beach - the bottom cleaned (this is one of the main attractions), it would be much better."
5464,"She treated me at Dr Rafałowicz's a few years ago and I was very disappointed. Because of gnashing her teeth she lost a tooth and the doctor was supposed to reconstruct it because the root was left. She screwed a metal stick to the root, on which she fixed an artificial tooth. After a week it started to move. When she went to m with the complaint she said that it was not her fault. She started m negotiating the money back. She was very dissatisfied and immediately became unpleasant. She was reluctant to return 1 / 3 of the amount. It turned out that the metal stick crushed the root. It was saved by a very professional dentist from Ursus, replacing the metal with an elastic material and the tooth is still holding on to this day. I do not recommend it."
5468,"I am not hiding it, but as for me it is a great leader I have had with him the analysis of 1 and 2 exercises and the guy is cool, you will sew a lot of bad things about him but don't believe I ever say that. The tasks he gives on his lap are cosmic, as he says, and most of the time there is no point in doing 1 because he is on the higher half. . the tasks he gives are strange, but in the exercises of the village he makes concrete, he knows what types of tasks are going to be on the wheel, no unnecessary nonsense which is not useful. the tasks are mostly to be solved through logic first of all and that is why you can not always come up with a solution. But it does not have a more specific village will say in the exercises and you only need an input for the exam if you fail in the circles and he takes a small part of what the lecture involves. I recommend to people thinking logically, do not be scared away by his appearance is a very nice man."
5469,"I just got back with my wife from Parasol Garden and I have a very nice memory of staying in this hotel. The rooms are furnished in a typical Spanish hotel style. They're cleaned daily and really decent. We had a room on the 8th floor and we had a view of the sea and the pool. Really cool. When we arrived at the hotel, because it's a big hotel, we were afraid that we would wait for the pool bar or the restaurant. However, there is no problem with that. You can easily find a table, either on the terrace, at the bar or in the restaurant. The service at the pool bar and the service, is really quick and helpful and quickly handles your requests. When it comes to food, if you like Spanish cuisine, you will find something for yourself, a gazpacho, paella and various Spanish dishes are served, which I consider a huge plus and minus. When it comes to the location, it is rare to find such a good one. The map seems to be a bit off the beaten track of Torremolinos, but actually, the centre is not far away. The beach is literally 60 meters away. There is also a train station (about 10 minutes away) from where you can get to Malaga or Fuengirolli, so trips along the Costa del Sol are at your fingertips. In a word, I recommend this hotel. There are no great luxuries, but this is after all a hotel with 3, 5 stars and I think that quietly on these 3, 5 - 4 deserves. We'll be back there for sure."
5470,"""A mostly positive picture of the life situation presented by people infected with syphilis can be a manifestation of the patients' wishful thinking about how it should be. Most of the patients presented themselves as if nothing exceptional had happened, and their life situation and social position have not changed - explained Prof. Teresa Rzepa, a psychologist from the Poznań branch of SWPS. - However, the most disturbing thing is that the infected persons show carelessness, which makes them a threat to their partners or passing lovers. In the most difficult psychological situation there are women infected during pregnancy by partners who do not reveal the fact of the disease and young people whose + first + ended up in hospital with a syphilis diagnosis"" - says prof . Turnip . Prof . Rzepa points out that new legal regulations do not force patients to disclose personal data of their sexual partners. Moreover, patients willingly use private medical practices and do not give the names of people who may be infected with syphilis. Often they also do not inform their partners about the need to see a doctor, which can prevent the development of the disease."
5471,"The hotel certainly does not deserve 4 *, maybe 3 * but weak. A tiny room, between the bed and the wall of 2 people will not pass. The bathroom is also small, you can only sit on the toilet because it is so tight. No kettle, no phone, no bathrobes, no water to drink. There is a fridge, hair dryer. There is also a safe but ""thoughtfully"" attached to the floor so only lying on the floor you can use it. In general, the room is not impressive - the equipment is tarnished and absolutely only 2 - 3 * . In the canteen kolkhoz - full of people with children . The food is bad, tasteless, artificial - I ate min . broth from a package . At night we were given a fire alarm - something burned in the kitchen. The spa was not used by 'em or the pool. There is a bar but the prices are not encouraging (beer 8 - 9zł). The hotel day ends at 10. I honestly do not recommend . A better choice is the hotel opposite where em was a year ago. I do not know where they came from 4 * and delighted in opinions - it is crowded and quite uncomfortable."
5472,"They hit us at Kruklin by chance, on a sunny May weekend. It seems to be the season, but we caught ourselves at an off-season price. We slept in a cottage, which I highly recommend, because hotels of this class are always more or less the same :) The cottage captivates with its interior design, original, artistic wooden furniture, you can stay in it with a four-legged man. The very habitat itself lies in the heart of the deaf, silence, peace, birds singing, buzzing insects and plenty of space. Delicious breakfasts with a lot of local products, which you can also eat while lying on the terrace. I also recommend a freestanding wood-burning sauna overlooking the forest, after which you can jump into the outdoor pool with great pleasure. We liked it very much, we will definitely come back."
5473,"""Our substance can be given by injection, but it can also be given orally - just like a pill with a medicine. For the time being it is of course science fiction , but in the future such a pill can influence the precise inhibition of cells responsible for alcoholism"" - he describes . In the future, the results of the study could be translated into other drug addictions such as . They all take place in the same area of the brain: in a reward system. The same cells, which are responsible for alcohol or drug addiction, control appetitious learning - i.e. the learning of pleasant sensations. ""For the brain it is the same mechanism. Only that addictive memories are strong enough to be practically irreversible, and we remember them for life. That is why if someone is an alcoholic, he or she will remain an alcoholic forever"" - emphasises the researcher."
5474,"As for the conditions of a very expensive hotel, there is no fixed price for rooms, the price depends on the occupancy rate in the hotel, how few guests is cheaper as more is expensive price for a 2-person room from 340, - to 500, - (accommodation with breakfast). Small rooms, worn out furniture, bathrooms need renovating. Traditional meals without revelation. The castle is worth a visit but not a rest. Organizational mess. Valentine's Day dinner by candlelight is just a nice name. The staff is not very nice . I do not recommend for rest . One plus is the indoor pool and SPA ( nice staff )"
5476,"Today, with more and more demanding guests and the ease of comparing prices on the Internet, it has become even more complicated. Nowadays, instead of managing capacity, hotels have taken a step forward and are actively looking for ways to increase their revenue based on their booking predictions. The customer-oriented revenue management system is becoming a critical factor for the hospitality industry! Amadeus believes that it is not just about matching rooms to people, but about matching all hotel operations to the expectations of one guest. Those hotels that are able to do this will be able to run true value, both for themselves and for their clients."
5477,I can recommend the same for algebra I - cool man - if there are any more on the polybud! 4 sheets of paper - 2 wheels - I recommend you to do it!
5478,"I recommend a stay in this hotel. It is a 4 * hotel located very close to the old town ( 15 minutes walk ), the Jewish quarter ( 10 min . on foot ) and the Wawel Castle ( 10 min . on foot ) . The old town is not accessible by car. Traffic is reserved only for hotels and residents. There are many roads around the hotel, so it is easy to get by car to the Salt Mine or to Oswiecim. If you park your car in an outdoor parking lot, you do not have to pay. If you prefer to park in a garage, there is a fee for this. You can use the internet on two computers in the lobby room. The connection speed is fine. The standard rooms are not too big, but they are clean and the furniture is modern. The breakfast included in the price is very good. Fruit, desserts, eggs, omelets, yoghurt, sausages, various types of bread, etc. are served. The staff is very nice, willing to help you get information and city maps."
5479,"In addition to the professionalism of an orthopedic doctor, it should be emphasized that Dr. Piotr is a man of class - kindness, cordiality, patience and willingness to help and answer questions. And the treatment and rehabilitation (suggestions for rehabilitation) have made me feel no more back pain. I also know how to take care of my spine so that it does not cause me any more problems."
5480,"1 . Massacre with access and parking . If you come to the hotel you have to make a circle of 2 , 5km 2 . Internet Is a joke ! IT DOESN'T WORK . First you can't connect. Even if it works, it throws out every moment. 3 . The room is some kind of hangar - wieelki, no intimacy, the window overlooks the restaurants and the corridor where first the piano was playing until 23rd and then from the morning people ate breakfast - GREAT ! 4 . The big room is a TV screen like in the times of rubies in communist Poland - mini 5 . Narrow bed, tragically uncomfortable pillows 6 . There is no towel hanger in the bathroom? ! ? ! - she put m by the washbasin - hygiene? ! ? ! Unfortunately with only : 1 . Breakfast 2 . Location"
5481,"I regret to write a negative opinion, because in my case the doctor did not help, but only plunged: ( I have E . The coli in my bladder for 2 years had already been treated with antibiotics and then it didn't work and the doctor prescribed me two more, equally ineffective. Now I know that when one or the other antibiotic does not work, there is no point in stuffing oneself with them because the bacterium is resistant - the doctor should also know about it. I am glad that she consulted another doctor who literally grabbed my head after seeing the list of drugs that she was taking without any sense. Mr. Marcin also treated me a little bit like a person who doesn't really understand what is being said to her, I understand that some people need to be explained by a patopathologist, but not everyone. She felt like a foolish person and now with the addition of ruined health with antibiotics. I'm slowly recovering, and I trust the treatment to someone else. Greetings"
5482,"The vacuum cleaner works for some time after the purchase, when everything is clean and expensive. It was used it has to be admitted in not very favorable conditions because after the renovation at the beginning it was ok, with time the power starts to fade. After a year of use it barely pulls. The filters were cleaned not replaced with new ones, so maybe in this also some mistake bagless vacuum cleaner is a plus, but how much of this shit will be poured in when emptying it is known. Generally quite loud at maximum power . The big plus is the accessories complete set of brushes for every need, although mainly used one ."
5483,"It was to be a short stay for one night at a reasonable price on the occasion of a business trip. Things got a little complicated, though. Chronologically, it looked like this: 1 . Attempted cancellation by the hotel . After I explained my rights, the room was found. 2 . On the spot (2 days later) it turned out that there is a big company party going on (hence the attempted cancellation), which excludes the possibility of having dinner. Nobody warned me about it3 . In the room the lock was jammed from outside. The manager advised me to lock myself from the inside, and after a strong answer, he found a key that stuttered less4 . The room (one) was definitely the second most fresh. Somewhere next door there was a boiler room or an air-conditioning unit, which caused a stubborn noise5 . Breakfast was late, instead of coffee in the thermos or the coffee machine, after the montage Nesca classic was brought in a jar. . . . 6 . I didn't notice a shadow of the staff's desire to blur the unpleasant impression the whole thing made on me. 7 . I would probably get over it (there were em on the spot for about 9 hours), but for maximum 50 PLN, not 150."
5484,"Poor opening of the flap by lack of embossing or something similar . Also slippery, so it can easily fall out of hand. Opening with one hand is already a gymnastics with a mouth"
5485,"I highly recommend this hotel - excellent service, very tasty and varied food. In addition, a lot of attractions - cool pools with a lazy river going out, jacuzzi and saunas; bowling alley, pool table, table football, pub, children's and adult club and ping pong. We also had a nice fireplace with a local band. Located a little bit on the sidelines of Szczyrk - about 2km to the ski lifts."
5486,"The Resilience to Fraud of the UK Hotel Sector report "" The Resilience to Fraud of the UK Hotel Sector "" estimates the value of fraud in the UK hotel sector at £2 billion. prepared by PKF and the University of Portsmouth consulting firm. The amount of losses corresponds to 5.7% of the industry's total revenue, which is approx. 40 billion pounds a year . According to the authors of the report, the hotel sector is one of the least resistant to fraud. On a scale of 50 points, the hospitality industry received 25.4 points, behind the entire private business sector, which received 30.6 points. Stuart Collins, National Hotel Partner at PKF, believes that fraud is a serious problem for hotels and has an impact not only on the condition of the industry but also on the quality and prices of services used by customers. Collins added: ""Reducing the loss of fraud is one of the least painful ways of minimizing company expenses in the current economic climate. All the more so as the costs of fraud - unlike expenses related to personnel, goods and equipment and real estate services - are unnecessary and unproductive. The most frequent hotel frauds are crimes committed by customers, such as those related to payments and payment cards."
5487,"When I bought the product I had no idea about quality, but it looked much better than junkers with similar parameters - and that was a mistake. Problems after 15 mc . operation, - replacement of the spark gap, 24mc and 1 day - replacement of the electronic module . I added 600 zloty because you can only fool me once, this company no longer exists for me, and if the stove fails again during the evening shower, then the president of vaillanta will find him in the driver's seat in his car . It's a total bubble, probably, so it's done to pay several times the value of the stove in the service during the 3 year period: )"
5488,"I was with this dermatologist because I had a problem with a rash on my trunk. Mrs. Stork looked at me from behind my desk and said that it's a hundred percent psoriasis, that it's an incurable disease, etc. She prescribed the ointment and sent it home, consulted another dermatologist who suspected Gilbert's pink dandruff, which lasts about 4-6 weeks, passes by itself and acquires immunity to this virus. This is how it was, after 4 weeks, the rash started to disappear and there is almost no trace of it. The doctor made me feel quite frightened by her incompetence, she didn't even look at me or listen to me about my symptoms etc. I don't recommend"
5489,"Today at 21. 00 wanted to book 'em a stay for May, the lady at the reception desk incompetent and unkind. When asked what the bed was, I heard 'em answer that the hotel's. What does it mean to be hotel. It means, sir, that the hotel one. I ask if it's married, and you answer me that it's hotel, that is, single. When asked what room is the best choice, you answer the one you want. The level of conversation is embarrassing. I felt as if I called a subordinate motel. Maybe it's a bad choice, but the first contact discouraged me so much that I give up my Mayday here."
5490,"Maybe even at a private visit the doctor actually presents his competence, but as a receiving cardiologist at nfz, he approaches the patient completely ""oiling"". The man waits for a few hours in the waiting room to enter the office for 5 minutes, not knowing anything about his health and being almost pushed out the door. The doctor, on the basis of the test results (blood and ekg), was not able to show in any way the condition of the heart. She did not answer a single question of mine and there were several of them - I think that every cardiologist with elementary knowledge would be able to speak and answer. She was directed to a holter examination, for which she set me a deadline in more than 7 months (laughter in the hall), and for the outsiders she said only that maybe I was in danger of surgery and with a brazen smile she pushed me out the door without responding at all to my concerns and questions. A total disrespect for the patient. She felt like I was in line at the post office - the stamp was nailed down and please step away from the window and now another! I definitely do not recommend this doctor !"
5491,"no hope all incliusiwe only by name, a miniature swimming pool of 10 lezakow on the whole hotel horror, food for pigs. The old and heated from the previous day after the intervention in the Rainbow Upright without any change, the shame of it is Europe unless it's Greek. Never again so excursions and we've been on many."
5494,"The rooms are large, spacious and bright with air conditioning, we lived on the third floor, on the balcony overlooking other hotels and worst of all the noise outside the window of the garbage truck and generator, deckchairs with umbrellas paid, bar far too far away, not many opportunities to explore. The service is quite oily - the manager has not found an alternative to the terrible noise coming from outside, floors higher definitely better standards, for the same price. In the building you could hear everything (even a neighbour's shower on the upper floors). By the pool cleaned from time to time. You can get up. The only thing that could save you from the evening was a party in the bar or an evening show organized by Animators in the ""amphi"" theater, tasty food, nicely prepared, in this respect everything is OK. Jakkuzi was closed during his stay. Sauna for a separate charge. Generally I recommend a trip in season and probably at once."
5495,"I'm also very disappointed in your attitude, Doctor. I was at her ultrasound in the seventh month and I left the office completely disgusted. I realize the doctor has a lot of patients and there's no time to be sorry for each one of them, but at least they could have a little bit of hymn and a smile for the day. She was dry and mean to me. To the two questions I have just asked, she answers very vaguely and with great resentment in her voice, that I dare ask anything! I've had ultrasounds with several other doctors before and I've never even been treated halfway. This is the worst gynecologist I've ever met - and I've dealt with many. Maybe it's a different approach to patients with diseases, but I wouldn't recommend visiting this lady for pregnant girls at all. Let's not interfere with the joy of waiting for the babies by such people: - )"
5496,"A strange hotel. . . Service at the reception desk not professional . We were together with our partner in this facility asked us for a double room and we got a single room for which we paid 300 PLN. In the room we found a single bed a set of towels for one person. We went to the reception desk to explain the situation unfortunately no one showed up within 40 minutes. Not far from the hotel there is a gas station where we bought not fresh sandwiches and nasty coffee, which the seller made with great grace. They wanted to order dinner at the restaurant, but it was already closed at 9 pm. Breakfast is a big disagreement the Swedish table empty was given to us breakfast to the basket table with a couple of old bread rolls of a plate of sausage and dried hot yellow cheese to choose from for scrambled eggs or hot hot sausage coffee made a lot earlier because instead of hot it was summer. The decoration of the hotel frightens the owner is probably a fan of space. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND"
5497,"I'm after my first visit and frankly, I'm disappointed. The first thing he told me is that if I come to the NFZ, he is not able to guide my pregnancy properly. . . . .so I have to think about it - that is, he told me to come to the NFZ, I am not to come with the pregnancy anymore. He graciously wrote down on a piece of paper what tests I should do (I wonder why not on a referral...) and that's only because he was asked for it by me, and I'm talking here about regular blood tests, tokos and so on (it's the beginning of pregnancy) She wanted my fiancé to be present at the ultrasound examination (so that he could also see the ball :)) but the doctor didn't agree, he said that there was nothing to see yet!"
5498,"A wonderful hotel in the city centre. Sufficient rooms with a well equipped bathroom . Clean, tidy, very comfortable beds. Close to the main monuments of the city. Good, helpful staff. We asked for 2 rooms on the same floor and so it was. We were very pleased with our stay at the hotel. We didn't use our breakfasts but we recommend the hotel restaurant and our own brewery. First class beer."
5499,"I've been dreaming about the night and actually wasted my life. Despite the lack of competence to perform nasal correction surgeries he carried out a few years ago, treating me ( probably ? ) as a guinea pig. Apart from the aesthetic harm, which is difficult to describe, which was the result of this doctor's surgery, and consequently also mental harm (somehow I have to deal with the changed appearance...), not to mention financial (numerous trips to the US and Canada for consultations and two more surgeries), I found out on my own skin what the postoperative complications are. Cut nerves in the palate, damage to the throat mucous membrane (and altered voice) - fortunately more sins I do not remember anymore. From the heart I advise you to avoid this and other doctors with too much ambition over the possibilities and competence. With the wishes of health and the full potential of life - very dissatisfied Patient of Dr. Michalik"
5500,"Bulbs changed 'em to Narve Rank Power White as super light. (Passat b6 lenticular lamps) Generally I thought that my eyesight was so bad when I came back from Wroclaw to Kielce over 300km in the evening, I had the impression that I was driving blindly, driving 'em every moment to the side of the road to let the cars that wanted to go faster, in the rain of the lashings at night, driving 'em like on the positional. When he came back he thought to go to an ophthalmologist but at night he drove 'em with a friend, he told me to turn the lights on and I told him that I have turned on, with my wife the same situation. Massacre bulbs, changed 'em to Ring. . . . .something there 120% in a gold-plated pack, a total gap at + . The banks are even all covered in blue, which I think causes a weakening of the light and gives an unpleasant bluish glow."
5502,"I have always associated the Medal of Honor with World War II and the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, it was decided to change this stereotype and introduce a novelty: a gameplay in the present time. I do not like such innovations . The game has nice graphics, but somehow it doesn't get on your knees. A big surprise was the ease of the game, I had no problems with its passage, perhaps because the partners were killing all enemies in front of me, which is very annoying. . . For me the game was terribly boring, too much action, boring storyline and these stupid dialogues at a time when I'm focusing on fighting and not reading pathetic texts."
5504,"Location excellent . Entrances to hiking and biking trails almost around the corner . Spacious and comfortable rooms . The food is very good, and also excellent coffee already for breakfast. The disadvantage is still a failed investment, which makes the swimming pool in the complex lacking, roads are very circular and parking lots are clogged. But generally the stay is successful and probably not the last."
5506,"A great profession on a similar samsung fridge. After 4 years he buys the second one so the description is not to this model but the most similar as I see on ceneo . I have a model two colored black inox. The fridge 4 years ago cost about 3000 PLN . To the point. Water distributor - fell a month after the warranty ( I have the same ) . Display 3 years after the warranty . But the worst thing about this fridge is the noise. He hasn't heard 'em buzzing anywhere in this fridge. You have to close the door to the room at night. And in the summer, it buzzes all the time because it can't cool. The frost-free system is the bottom. You have to defrost the fridge every six months because on the back wall behind the casing there is a layer of 10 cm of ice which blocks the air intake control flaps. The effect is that the freezer on the upper drawers has a positive temperature. The look and operation is great but nothing else . I strongly advise against ."
5508,"I went to see your doctor during pregnancy. Unfortunately, he didn't have blood and urine tests regularly. He said that you don't have to do tests every month. She was doing them herself on her own, as the doctor in the hospital pointed out to me where she wanted me to give birth. He was surprised that there are no regular tests. Unfortunately, the ultrasound equipment which the doctor performs the examination does not make descriptions in English or Latin, but in German. When she went to give birth to a state hospital and not to a damian, the doctors were nervous that nothing from these examinations results and if someone does not know German they cannot read them. The first examination was only done when she started going to the hospital where she went to. The visit consisted only of doing an ultrasound examination, which was done during each visit."
5509,"Hello, I recently had a cartilage and bone nose surgery. I am very pleased with the operation and its effect. Everything went without complications, which allowed me to recover quickly. My nose is proportional to my face and not like before, hunchbacked and torn. I do not regret my decision because the effect is very beneficial."
5510,"The room wasn't cleaned, very tight (one person had to enter the bed if the other wanted to go through) Torn out power sockets, the TV was destroyed, probably with 25 years old (with the remote control not working) Problems with opening the door with a card. . . far from the bus stop. For $ $ of scrambled eggs every day, hard eggs and the same sausages, water for tea brewing mostly lukewarm, practically not working wi fi (internet generally weak in this area) The hotel has a place to barbecue, upon arrival we prove that there is no such place. In general, I do not recommend it."
5512,"Warszawianka is close to Warsaw and we like her very much but: the service is not on level 4 * . . starts with the reservation itself. We've been to the hotel several times, but every time we make a phone reservation we have to give an email address to confirm the reservation. Each time this confirmation does not reach us and we need more reminders. Strange that it is so difficult to coordinate the customer base with his e-mail. Especially in these times when the data is so valuable. . The second thing is the impossibility of ordering morning coffee to your room. She heard the m. . : ""not because you don't."" It wasn't until after the intervention at the reception that she succeeded. Ladies and gentlemen, if the room service does not include a morning latte, please write this. Morning discussions with the reception desk / room service etc are tiring. . Another matter is the crowd in the pool. I am surprised that when the hotels are occupied, people from outside are allowed into the pool. Such a crowd is not very relaxing. Plus for a good but crowded breakfast. . One more thing is the poorly animated kids. Children defend themselves from going into the playroom. . And I'm not surprised at all. . No attractions and the ones that are, are heavily enforced. . ."
5513,"Nice plate - until you start using it . It is fatally cleaned, the tiniest dot of water is very visible, and cleaning it with various means borders on a miracle. I have had the board for 2 months, I clean it after each use and it looks like after 3 years of use by students. Additionally a huge minus for service and contact with them. Nowhere on the manufacturer's website, in any phone call to the manufacturer is there any information that the vents heat up so that if you have glass on the wall it will obviously break! ! There is nothing about the fact that it is necessary to install tempered glass pane! ! And on the phone and talking about this problem from the service you can only hear what Solgaz cares about. We regret the purchase of this board - for such money the quality and service should be at a higher level."
5514,"An average hotel that can be said to be ""ok"". Spacious rooms, traditionally furnished, small bathrooms - generally for business trips ok. With the family, or for a comfortable rest with friends, I would rather not choose it. Comfortable beds, unfortunately very thin walls, so high noise level between the rooms. She did not use the spa part, supposedly quite good. One elevator in the whole hotel. Nice and competent service. In the restaurant quite long waiting time for the dishes, the quality of the dishes in order. She was very surprised by the name and location of the hotel, and was pleasantly surprised by the plus."
5515,"Close to the center, nice rooms, nice service. I recommend, . . . . .without a car. . . It describes that it has free parking spaces! ! . . .and that sometimes the car can be parked on the street! ! ! also for free ! ! without the grace of your owner! ! ! He would rather park his car safely in a parking lot where he will be monitoring and enjoying his holiday than worrying in this guesthouse that his local neighbors will scratch my car! ! !"
5516,"dr . Juste, even though he's reticent, he's specific. In the hospital he does not distinguish his patients from private practice, he treats them on an equal footing with others. I accidentally found out about her pregnancy during an examination. She was very moved and he congratulated me and hugged me warmly, so she knew that she is a trustworthy doctor. Dog . The doctor has a nice recorder : )"
5517,""" Hotel in a beautiful area in the middle of the forest "" - That's probably 20 years ago ! Next to the hotel there is a very busy road, the rooms are loud, and the stench is omnipresent. The rooms look beautiful in the pictures. I advise against staying with everyone. It is probably better to pay a little more and live in normal conditions."
5518,"The headphones have already been withdrawn from production - the opinion writes as a warning to possible amateurs of goods from sale or second hand. I chose these headphones because of the ( apparently ) excellent workmanship and sound quality . The headphones sound really good: the sound is slightly dimmed but not dull - the treble and midrange are very saturated, the bass is also great and, contrary to some opinions, well balanced - e.g. . It does not interfere with the message in intimate recordings. The list of advantages is complemented by high wearing comfort and excellent isolation from the environment. Unfortunately, my idyll with M1 lasted only half a year - after this period (probably) the cable inside the headband broke down - which is odd because the headphones are not folded, so the damage probably occurred as a result of a simple adjustment when putting them on your head. In my copy, fortunately, the pads did not peel off - which is supposedly a typical case of this model (on the mp3store forum there is even a separate thread on this subject). Of course, the product is under warranty, but Philips does not service it anymore so I will receive a refund. The lack of service for the model for 900 - 1000 PLN (catalogue price), introduced to the market two or three years ago, proves the worst for the manufacturer."
5519,"In Cuma we stopped for one night and I must admit that the object makes a positive impression. The facility is clean and tidy, the service is nice and helpful. Cuma is somehow divided into two standards - cheaper, obviously hostel, with shared bathrooms and more expensive - at hotel level, rooms with their own bathrooms. We used a room of a higher standard - it was very clean, spacious, the bathroom was also clean and aesthetic. The equipment itself - very basic - a wardrobe, two beds and a TV set. What should be kept in mind - in contrast to hotels - for each element is paid separately: - room, - bedding (8 PLN per set), - towels (4 PLN per item), - parking (12 PLN per day). The hotel day ends quite early, because at the hour. 10 : 00, but for a reasonable price it can be extended (so-called. day stay). The object is well located: right next to the parks - Jasne Błonia and Kasprowicz Park, next to the beautiful, XIX century part of Szczecin. I recommend it to all who are looking for accommodation in decent conditions for a reasonable price."
5520,"She was a private patient of my professor. At the visit, the doctor kindly explained his doubts and referred him immediately to the hospital due to elevated cancer markers and a change in the ovary. He said that with the ovary it is never fully known so as soon as possible the change must be removed. In the hospital as a patient of professor Suzina was treated very well even though I was admitted to the hospital in the evening, but first thing in the morning I had done all the necessary consultations and was the first to be taken to the operating theatre. So everything is wonderful. . . . . . .until. . . After the operation, the professor informed me that there were no lesions on the ovary, but endometriosis was detected which could have caused an increase in cancer markers. A great relief. . . She left the hospital after 5 days. . . After 3 weeks, I showed up and the professor at the check-up. The doctor assured me that everything was fine, there was no change on the ultrasound. Everything was back to normal. She was supposed to report for another check-up, but because of the colossal prices in the professor's private office she went to her gynaecological clinic to the doctor who noticed the change first. After examining me and having an ultrasound, the doctor found that nothing had actually changed and the change in the ovary was still there. The doctor at the outpatient clinic was setting up what kind of surgery was carried out in the hospital in Lodz since the lesion that had put me on the operating table was not removed. Anxiety and shock . She didn't believe me, so she went to another doctor, took all my results, ultrasounds, and the discharge from the hospital to verify the information received. Professor Suzin says that everything is ok and there is nothing to worry about, the doctor at the clinic that they did not operate well. The consultation with the third doctor confirmed that the ovarian change was indeed not removed. It turned out that nobody looked inside the ovary but looked at it on laparoscopy from outside. One big failure. How can you be such a doctor? Until now I am under the control of a doctor, I have regular examinations, I get used to the next surgery. All because of Professor Suzin, who not only didn't make sure that I was well operated on, but also lied in his eyes, saying that there is nothing to worry about. What if she didn't go to another doctor? She went to the professor because she wanted me to be taken care of. However, it turns out that the fact that someone has the title of professor and cancels 400 PLN for a visit is not a measure of quality. I definitely do not recommend ! ! ! ! !"
5521,"Upon arrival, ok. 1 at night, after several minutes of waiting for someone at the reception, it turned out that our room has a fault and we were accommodated in the nearby Kostas apartments. Only in the morning we realized that these apartments are mostly occupied by refugees. Our ""apartment"" was tidied up, so much so that the bed linen and towels were changed. The table could be sticky, there was hair on the floor and towels on the balcony. Around noon, we moved to our ""room"" in building 1. In fact, at the instigation of a resident, we tried to make things right, but a nice older owner started to make some problems. He did not agree to the air conditioning (it is paid 5 € per day). The owner's son offered us dinner and lunch in satisfaction. We took advantage of the supper, however, with dinner already the dear landlord withdrew, saying that he offered us a choice - either dinner or lunch. The rooms are clean, cleaned daily, and the ladies of the service are very nice. Breakfast at the hotel day by day the same: bread, margarine, cheese, ""ham"". ...salami, chocolate cream, honey, jam, cornflakes, yogurt, black olives, cake. You can buy a hard-boiled egg - 0,50 €. Zero vegetables and fruit. No surprise, all the same every day. The hotel itself is located in a side street with little traffic leading to the main road on the island. The neighborhood is rather weak. The beaches are behind the main road. Paid deck chairs + umbrella 5 € . Wild beaches so littered and neglected that you can forget about your holiday. Only on Cape Psalidi is pretty enough. Must-have safety shoes . Rent a bike and scooter on the hotel premises (4 € per day) . The biggest advantage of the hotel is a pleasant swimming pool (depth 1, 10 - 3, 30m). It can be used from 8. 00 to 20 . 00 . To the town of Kos throw a beret. Unfortunately, because of the refugees, it is no longer pretty here. The tents and makeshift accommodation are located along the promenade. The castle from the sea side is better avoided, the stench of faeces and nomadic refugees. In conclusion, I am disappointed. For many years I have been spending my holidays in Greece, choosing small family hotels with swimming pools, close to the sea. The Greeks have always seemed very nice to me, family-friendly and trouble-free. I guess that's why I'm going on this trip. . ."
5522,"I spent 5 weeks in the hotel. The rooms are ok, they are not claustrophobic but they are also not apartments. They are daily cleaned, towels are changed. In the corridors where there are non-smoking rooms you do not smell unpleasant smells as it is in Ibis on al. Jerusalem where it is much worse. The room is missing a kettle and the hotel unfortunately does not even give water to drink. These two things are already standard but unfortunately not in IBIS. Breakfast is good. I lack a little bit of possibility to order myself an scrambled eggs in my own degree, but I can get over it. Generally in the morning, I always went out eaten . Communication with the center is really good . You can get from the stops next door in many places in Warsaw. After these 5 weeks I personally recommend ."
5523,"Excellent location, close to a large shopping centre. With option BB cool catering base . The hotel is clean and, in my opinion, elegant and, above all, quiet. Very well and nicely equipped rooms, those from the street noisy but air conditioning allowed to sleep with windows closed. It had a view of the garden and the swimming pool, 6th floor - great view and silence. Funchal can be reached on foot or several times a day by free hotel transport, without any registration and without crowding. Breakfast was tasty in the ""English"" style, but everyone could enjoy it. The swimming pools are great around the beautiful garden and the area is well maintained. . All in all, a very successful stay. People who complain should stay at home."
5524,"I don't recommend it. Maybe for women already pregnant Mrs. Szymborska is good, but certainly not for those trying to have a child. She was going to visit her when she was using contraception and here she was flawless because in total she had too many questions not having m and the pills worked well. But when she came to Mrs. Szymborska as a person trying to have a child and to this I got a hemorrhagic cyst, which delayed my period, she heard that I will absorb, and if I have a stomachache, I have to go to the emergency room, she did not get any prescription. . . . .no words, spent senselessly over 200 zloty, for the visit and for the service. And additionally, at my request, that she wanted me to be examined because we are trying to have a child, then for 3 months, she heard that I have to come next year, if we do not succeed. . . I do not recommend it again."
5525,"If you're looking for a really good doctor, don't look anymore! Stay here on this page and visit Dr. Rafał Ptaszyński . I was at your doctor's place yesterday, the usual visit turned out to be extraordinary! I think for the first time in her life she felt that someone really wants to listen to me and help. The doctor devoted as much time as necessary to me, he did not rush anything, every detail was important. In a month's time, I'm going to the check-up. I already know it will be my Doctor! Greetings to the happy patient Hanna Komar."
5526,"I was tempted by the good opinions about this doctor and went to visit the NFZ to see a doctor. I regret it. I won't go there anymore. Not enough that the date of the visit is waiting for a long time (I'm a month), then that's the drive that is there on Wednesday afternoon (the doctor takes only 2 hours and is 30 minutes late...) In 1, 5 hours, the doctor served more than 25 women. I don't have to say what the visit looked like. The check, 5 minutes and departure. Never again. I thought I'd be pregnant with this gentleman. But I can't imagine sitting 2 hours in line and then leaving the office after 5 minutes. Pregnant women have no entry priority. The queue is on the Hurrah, because there are no records for hours. I suppose in private the doctor is great and the way you write. But what doctor would allow such treatment for his patients? Thank you, I won't take any more. I don't recommend it. She had a big problem in her first pregnancy and the doctor wasn't very interested in it. He didn't look me in the eye once. . . . It's hard, I guess I'm staying in private. . ."
5527,"This is not a good hotel. Staying there is tiring. You can't get any sleep, and you certainly can't sleep with the window open. You can hear the noise from the street, late in the evening the silence is disturbed by watering the garden, and from about. At 6 a.m., a rooster starts to drink, which someone keeps on the plot behind the hotel. The rooster is drinking non-stop at least until 9 am. It smells so musty in the wardrobe that the clothes she kept in her suitcase all the time. Lack of professional service, it is difficult to get along in English. This is not the place where she felt good about m . She wanted me to get out of there as soon as possible."
5528,"The only plus for the bar - low beer prices. Even the price does not justify torn towels, bad breakfasts and some liquid instead of coffee or tea. The building from the ""justly bygone"" times undoubtedly needs renovating, but this is not the biggest problem of this ""hotel"", lack of a manager?"
5529,"We used the romantic package. We were given probably the worst room at the end of the corridor overlooking the parking lot. The room was cold, the heating was not working. The water under the shower between summer and warm. The bathroom was scandalously small and the towels were very rough. We were informed before arrival that there would be no problem with reserving a spa, while on the spot it turned out that reserving treatment dates is only possible at nine o'clock in the morning. The dishes with fatal cards . The cook has no idea about cooking. Cod was sticky and terribly insipid, while pureed from peas so salty that it is impossible to eat. Breakfast is average . Around nine o'clock in the morning it is difficult to find a place in the restaurant. The corridors in the hotel were dark and narrow (the last floor) . Feel the moisture. Bowling reservation impossible due to reservation of organized groups. Service staff extremely incompetent and incomprehensible smile ."

5531,"The hotel is very nice, clean and well maintained. The swimming pool area is also well maintained, everything works and the service is very nice. I was most surprised by the kitchen, which served really delicious dishes (although during the week breakfast closer to 10 : 00 you can compare to the state of the shops before Christmas - shelves shining empty: ) ) . The only thing I can attach myself to is a room above the kitchen - until the music is playing in the bar you can hear rumbling in the room through the loudspeakers hanging from the ceiling - as in the evening it practically doesn't bother me when the kitchen opens at 6-7 in the morning I didn't like it. However, I recommend the hotel itself 100% and I will definitely come there again, although I hope for another room :)"
5532,"I highly recommend this place ! My wife and I are delighted to stay in Mandzijowka! Good location, nicely furnished rooms, nice and helpful hosts, delicious food - just a homely atmosphere! We will definitely come back! The driveway from the street is steep, but both by car and on foot has not caused us much trouble: )"
5533,"The location is the only downside of this hotel - a walk to Piazza Duomo takes more than half an hour; besides, the positives themselves - very friendly and friendly staff (because of the time of arrival in Milan, we arrived at the hotel before the start of the hotel day - we were accommodated without any problems); clean rooms, comfortable beds, great - rich and varied - breakfast, quiet surroundings and certainly the hotel deserves to consider staying there again when returning to Milan,"
5534,"I decided to perform an ear correction procedure in Mrs. Dobaczewska's clinic. Frankly speaking, I did not feel the atmosphere of the ""procedure"" much. because the wonderful background music and the omnipresent smiles just didn't let me do it: D . The doctor knows perfectly well what she is doing and at the same time she is incredibly nice and concrete. During the procedure the only thing that bothered me was an itchy nose. I think this clinic deserves the highest marks, really. I do not write it because I was charmed by Mr. Janusz working at the reception desk. However, I think that having such a competent person in this position is an additional advantage of this place. A few times I happened to call the clinic between checks and each time Mr. Janusz gave me exhaustive answers. And he will brew tea in the waiting room and talk. D Another thing worth mentioning here is the hygiene of work in this place. Clean, fragrant and sterile. I don't think we need more. You can see that someone put a lot of heart in this clinic. Wonderful staff, thanks to whom the most important moment of my life became even better. And it may be strange that he describes this place in superlatives alone, but what to do if I don't see the downside. Now I'm in control of Mrs. Daria's work and I'm enjoying it more and more. I recommend I recommend I recommend it. And greet the whole crew ! See you in 6m - cy : D"
5535,"I'm not saying that your doctor is a bad doctor but I'm disappointed. I came to her with a skin allergy and even though she saw that your doctor had no idea what it could be and how to treat it, she wrote me some creams (in fact, not healing but moisturizing) and recommended that I buy gloves for the night from the internet. What's worse, she listened to me even though she didn't report any cough-related ailments etc. Of course, she deleted it normally instead of admitting that she does not know about the problem and recommend another doctor."
5536,"The hotel is well located. Close to a busy street but between the buildings so it is quiet. In the hotel there are ""super"" elevators - claustrophobic, when two guys go it's maximum two there will enter. therefore there are mega queues for elevators. The rooms seem to be fine, but dirty. They're tidied up at the back. Even on the shells of the previous guests was dracha. Cool that there's a kitchenette, well equipped. Unfortunately, there's a mess in the cabinets. I understand that the hotel is cheap, that it has cheaper furnishings but I don't understand why the management doesn't care about cleanliness."
5538,"Doctor Joanna Orlicz - Widawska has a great heart for the patient, great knowledge and medical intuition, so rare among doctors who accidentally choose their profession. In my opinion, it is medical intuition, that is ""something"" that cannot be learned at any Medical Academy, that makes the doctor make such accurate diagnoses! ! I have been suffering from so-called Quincky's swelling for 15 years and none of the doctors could offer any other treatment than steroids (and for 15 years, believe me, she was with many ""wonderful"" doctors). It turned out that there are other options for treating this troublesome disease. Now I have not taken steroids for 2 years and the disease is under control. I will be thankful for this Doctor for the rest of my life! !"
5539,"If someone is looking for a doctor who will tell and explain everything, it's not that person. The doctor is very specific, but if you ask for something, he will of course answer the questions. His/her occupancy in Luxmed is very high, therefore the visit is very short, but the doctor directs to the indicated examinations e.g. thyroid ultrasound (which the previous doctors did not do to me). In case of problems with appointments in Luxmed (e.g. ultrasound), the doctor is willing to accept his patient as an additional person if the treatment process requires it."
5541,"The hotel is perfect in every way. Hot greetings to all hotel staff from the manager to the cleaners. The surroundings of the hotel, Anthony Quin Beach, Faliraki, the city of Lindos behind St. Paul's Bay and the Monolith's Castle are wonderful. The Hotel Evita and its staff give you a feeling of security, peace and complete relaxation."
5542,"I can only talk about a restaurant that was average - a huffy waiter and a nice waitress. Average food (deer goulash was very insipid) and quite expensive, mistaken order (the partner ordered the gloves with the stew and in return he got the deer stew - the waiter said he had to eat it because the gloves were gone; we did not want to make a scene)."
5543,"I reserve the right not to know what other rooms look like, but the eight-person room in which we were placed is located in the basement where (especially in the evening) it was extremely hot and stuffy (despite a large fan occupying the middle of the room). Unlike other generators, there is no bathroom in the room (a shared bathroom in the hallway used by many people), no lights and no contact by the beds. . friendly staff but not interested in their guests. . there is a bar and a restaurant and rest rooms but . . not very clean and impersonal. . . the only advantage is that the hostel is very close to St Pancras International and the underground. ."
5544,"I had a chance to be at the Vergilius Hotel Billia last year. The room looked like a mixture of everything else bed different bed different cabinets and a wardrobe with a different barrel, but the worst was just before us in the plastic window or rather the shutters was a hole in size. . . . .fists and, as it happens in January, it was just cold. In spite of the application to the staff, nobody was able to help ( ! ! ! ! ) they said that they could give us an extra blanket ( laughing worth ) . The next day after coming back from a trip around the city, they realized that money and a receipt for cigarettes had disappeared (there are cigarette machines in Naples but you have to show proof if you don't show it, a receipt is printed and you can pick it up the next day by showing proof in the stationary store). . . There was no one else to clean up. They reported it to the reception desk and . . . . . . . .and, of course, there was nothing anyone else to do about it. . . . Breakfast was very good and the location was also. . ."
5545,"The food is not bad. But the service is terrible. Waiting time for meals is not acceptable. The food is tasty, it keeps the level. Pizza on good dough. Good mules in season. Tasty goose. Unfortunately - combined with always waiting for food for a long time - does not encourage visits."
5546,"Graphical record of the construction ( lab ) Electric normal rather so all labs pass the pass all labs + housework no normal neutral : it can be Prof . nothing stands out. He evaluates the works on AutoCAD fairly objectively, although he likes to be jumpy. Worse with homework . He already likes to stick to his drawings, generally he has a marauding nature. There is no slack, but there is also no terror. He's a bit twisted (one work he once evaluated at 4, so he wouldn't accept it later: roll :) . Sometimes he doesn't know what he wants, or he just wants to get a little tired and check his perseverance: wink: If you take the subject seriously, the work you wear on time, there should be no major problems."
5547,"A good doctor, he took up my treatment as the only one, none of the doctors could tell me what to do and after visiting him it is better. In my opinion he is a competent specialist, he knows what he is doing, although the style of being is actually controversial and you just have to get used to it. Something for something."
5548,"Hotel to recommend, as someone likes a homely atmosphere. I think it will be great for the summer. This spring, unfortunately we have a lot of snow, so going out to the restaurant, which is in a separate building, was a bit tedious. . . .but overall I recommend it. The hotel is beautifully located. The food is tasty."
5549,"I also recommend Mrs. Elizabeth, a very nice and competent person. The dietary plan prepared by Mrs. Elizabeth was adjusted to my lifestyle, and all the dishes were interesting, tasty and, above all, full. I managed to lose weight and develop a habit of healthy and regular eating. I am satisfied, I highly recommend it."
5550,"I have been to see Dr. Podlesna several times, but despite the hope that she would help me cure my spine or relieve its pain, it did not happen. She lost my time and nerves, she didn't send me to any examination, she didn't give me any referral, she only prescribed painkillers, which turned out to be too strong for me, she prescribed medicines for sciatica, which she didn't have m! ! ! Failure. . . more says no more about . . . . .visits to the Doctor last 4 minutes. . .

Dr. Podleśna emphasized that she can only give 1 referral per year, what a shock! Frankly speaking I was very dissatisfied with her and I advise against visiting her. . ."
5551,"Generally a nice hotel, but with very poor service. Generally with the stay was em satisfied, but the quality of service in the restaurant disqualifies this hotel as a hotel * * * * . After coming to the restaurant for breakfast, I couldn't find a table because 50% of the tables were occupied by guests and 50% of the tables were not cleaned after guests who had breakfast. He asked the staff to indicate a table for 4 people where I could have breakfast. The table was indicated to me, the other lady took the dirty dishes, but for the next 10 minutes no one cleaned up the crumbs from the previous guests, no one set the table for the new guests. I can't understand why in a hotel where the cheapest rooms cost 400 PLN the quality of service in the restaurant is at the hostel level."
5552,"At first I was afraid to see Mr. Martina because I've never been to a specialist like that. He didn't know if I'd be able to open up and say what I really had a problem with. But after a while, all the fears were gone. It felt like I was talking to my best buddy. He saw 'em take my problem seriously and she was looking for some way out of my problem for me for which I thank her very much. From the bottom of his heart, he recommended that I talk to Mr. Martyna for everyone. Thank you very much for talking to her and understanding."
5553,She's very nice and competent. My first visit went without any reservations. The examination was painless. The only thing I didn't like was the way the drug was explained. I was not informed about the side effects of the medicine prescribed to me. She read everything in the leaflet. But I'll definitely visit her again. I recommend this doctor. . .
5555,"She has heard a lot about the Valley and finally at the beginning of September she managed to choose there. But I have no intention of repeating this trip. First of all, the sauna is not separated enough from the pool area - you can hear the noise, it is hard to calm down; additionally, there is no water dispenser. As for dinners - a huge profession. First of all, the buffet is moderately diversified, messy. Tables not covered. On the second day, dinner was available from 16 to 19 - in my opinion, definitely too short (because of these hours we did not take advantage of the ordered massages, but it would take a long time to describe). However, the worst thing was that after coming, nobody came to us to indicate the table, nobody came to ask if we want to order alcohol, nobody lit a very nice and climatic candle on the table. During the meal no one came up to clean the plates and they were standing on top of each other because there was no room - we were completely ignored by the staff, who did not have much work because the three of us were standing behind the bar and talking. On the second day they took the table next to the couple who seemed to have bought a romantic package - the waitress approached them, asked for wine and lit a candle, but she did not turn to our table to do the same. Tragedy, I don't recommend this hotel and I don't plan on going back there myself."

Michał Pędziwiatr . As he explained, the main indication for liver surgery are metastases of other cancers (mainly colorectal cancer) to this organ.

5558,"I was only once, so my opinion may not be entirely objective, but as far as I was concerned, the doctor was 100% professional, everything I asked for was explained to me from the office, I came out very satisfied, I'm sure I'll visit as soon as possible."

5561,"At first the hotel made a good impression on me. Nice, neat, tiny but clean and tidy rooms. The swimming pool is also small, but the hot water, anti-freeze, whips, whirlpools and saunas are, so just relax. Unfortunately, the whole effect is spoiled by the hotel staff, especially the waiters, completely unprofessional, even dry and unpleasant referring to customers. Forget about any help from their side, in case of customer complaint they hide in the back. It is hard not to mention the restaurant, it is a nightmare of our Easter stay in this hotel. Small, tight, tables half the number of people staying at the hotel. Before each meal the queue and the hunt for a free table. Incredible these days! ! The topic of my vegetarian diet was a real challenge for the waiters, after having brought something ""not meaty"" to the waiters' attention several times, they were given a cheese and strawberry jam. Well, I managed not to starve to death this Easter: - ) but it's sad when you have to ask for every thing. Even the horseradish for Easter breakfast was not. Unfortunately, eating during the Easter period is an important part of your hotel stay and here, unfortunately, the lid on the whole line. I would also add that there is no lobby bar in this hotel, three sofas near the reception desk and a bar in the aforementioned horrible restaurant. There was no place to spend the evening with the family. I absolutely do not recommend this place."
5562,"A keyboard tablet with good parameters at a very good price . A good 4 GB frame configuration and a 64 GB drive in this price class is the exception. The computer runs stable and quite long on one charge . Ideal for travelling . Very robust design . I have problems with charging . The charger has gone to service . It takes a very long time to charge and the usb C cable must be very carefully inserted into the socket . Little movement and it stops charging. WiFi works a little less well than other devices I have, but it is acceptable. The aluminum housing has the advantages, but probably has a little bit of an effect on the antenna's performance. Generally recommended for the average user, more demanding users need to look for better equipment."
5564,"I have a plate 4 + 1 in just 2 months, and it is a nightmare when I have to cook meals for the family, there are not 3 medium sized pots, burners when cooking they just go out, stains came out under the glass, which of course cannot be cleaned, the superlative which releases the salt is a big lie and misleading people supposedly was to be a gas saving and for example in the month of May I changed the cylinders twice i.e. 1 ...May and 28 have your meals cooked normally as in the previous kitchen, I had gas for one and a half months in the old kitchen. I wouldn't give for that plate even 500zl for today, I swear the day I bought it. I ADVISE AGAINST BUYING A PLATE OF SALT! ! !"
5566,"A beautiful village, a hotel in a good location, great service and safe gluten-free food that was served to the table. Every day a bread roll (from the oven) and cupcakes, cakes (Schar) and gluten-free ice cream waited for breakfast. For lunch and dinner a special dish was made by the kitchen wardrobe, which was served to the table. Thank you Jose Miguel: ) and Lola G . for the excellent service and help. The food was 100% safe, and I am very gluten sensitive. I think the hotel could have a gluten-free dish that is labelled Sin Gluten. There was a lot of gluten-free food, but you just need to change the arrangement of the food on the table because there was cross-contamination. I recommend 100% gluten-free food for celiacs provided that it is served to the table. Magdalena"
5567,"He has been using em for over a year with the Jabra BT2046 until he accidentally damaged it. He changed 'em to Style, the first impression is very cool, the handset is lightweight, it fits well in the ear (I had to adjust the way I attach it to the ear a little bit) but it is comfortable, and you can't feel it even after hours of wearing it. Sound quality at a very high level, in my callers also. The problem with the handset, however, is that it does not signal when a call is answered or disconnected, and the battery is extremely short, if the device is connected to the phone. BT2046 could be charged once every 5-6 days (for 12-13 hours connected to the phone, and 3-4 hours of calls). Here, with the same use, I have to charge it every other day, and sometimes when I talk more, it will not last until the end of the second day."
5569,"Beautiful view and that's it. Everywhere there is a ford, the room stinks, sheets and towels are not correct. Mould in the bathroom, damaged furniture. There is food and that's it. I'm certainly not coming back here. Such a resort lowers the standards of Turkish hotels, which are at a very high level."
5570,"Hello, I highly recommend this hotel, you can see that the owners are not only focused on making money because they invest in this property (you can see changes compared to the previous year). However, what bothered us very much was the openness of the hotel to people from outside, who wanted to take advantage of hotel attractions such as the swimming pool or playland for children, of course it is an additional income for the hotel. However, this was enough to make it crowded everywhere and spoil the pleasant atmosphere that the hotel offers to families with children. I personally highly recommend the hotel to people who have not been in it yet and are planning a trip to our sea, but we thank you and say no."
5571,"He told me the same thing as the others: adhesions, crooked uterus (because I supposedly sleep on one side), thin endometrium (because I came to him with infertility). For a year I went to him a few times in a month on a seemingly - observation of the cycle, which led to nothing. He was prescribing me the same drugs as the others, including those MEMBERS ON! you don't know what ! ... she lost hours in his waiting room, even though she had an appointment for a particular hour. she didn't get any referrals for any tests. I complained about the problem with inflammation - he ignored it; he said that if I follow his recommendations, I will pass out (cotton underwear, not putting my leg on, low-carbohydrate diet, not exaggerating with intimate hygiene products). - But a year of strict adherence to the advice did not give anything (because it is a prophylaxis and not a treatment ...) and the results of infertility treatment - my friend went to him because she was planning to get pregnant and wanted to check if everything was OK. He told her that she would not get pregnant because (and here the uterus curve, adhesions, etc ...) - she should be treated with him (suppositories, etc.) . Of course, another doctor did not confirm this ""diagnosis"" of his. And she got pregnant normally and without problems. But after a year of treatment, not only did I not get pregnant, but I was still undiagnosed why. I wonder if she shouldn't actually complain to the doctor's office."
5572,"Aesthetically made, but after 3 months of use it stopped working. In college without a flash drive, it's like in war without a gun. The casing is made of aluminum (read: amelinium), but the inscriptions wear off immediately. The flash drive during read/write, heats up and loses data transfer speed. A bad technical solution, the lanyard hole has a plug on the back, so either you have the lanyard and plug in your hand or you have no lanyard and plug in place. Generally I am disappointed with this pendriver, for which I gave 'em 100 pln."
5573,"The scandalous thing is that there is no heating at 150 PLN per night in October! (the reception said that once they are heating and once they are not heating and can propose a blanket. . ) . It's a good thing that I was alone in a 2-person room so I could sleep under 2 duvets and a blanket, wearing a sweater and the rest of my clothes. The worst was before me. . . . .before going to bed they saw 'em worm walking on the bed, but they underestimated 'em. In the morning I woke up all bitten by bugs ( bed - bugs ) . Due to the rush, I didn't manage to report it when I checked out. During the daytime, em started to swell up and itching is unbearable. For such an exorbitant price he hoped I would sleep in human conditions and not fight the cold and bugs living in their beds. It's a good idea to report to the sanitarium! It's a scandal that things like that happen in a town like this, at this price. I'm enclosing photos as evidence of my nightmare at the Cinnamon Hostel. BYPASS THE WIDE ARCH! ! !"
5574,"The hotel has nothing to do with it, it is certainly great for skiers, because the slope is next to the hotel, you can see it from the restaurant windows, as for the room, it is seemingly clean, but not exactly, a lot of reservations, especially in the bathroom. The hotel itself, in its style, is typically highlander, does not impress with anything. . . . . .food, hmm. Well, there's no frenzy. . . . .but for a winter outing I think it's okay. . ."
5575,"My wife and I have chosen this hotel because it has many attractions for children. For us it is very important, because of our child, who never likes to be bored: ) ) We estimate our stay in Grand Lubicz at 5 + because of the sensational location, delicious food, which was varied every day! We were pleasantly surprised by the ""live cooking"" option, which deserves a big plus! The rooms are properly cleaned and nice service from the first to the last day of our stay. We hope that we will still visit this hotel again one day because we have not missed anything and the prices were not exorbitant as for 5 stars. . . Greetings!"
5576,"I had the dubious pleasure of using the doctor's services twice privately in August, my 6-month-old son was a spider. Patients are scheduled every 15 months. and literally that's how long a visit lasted. The interview is three questions: I was born, how is the baby fed and if there are any allergies in the family. The doctor briefly assessed the condition of the child's skin, listened, there was no weighing or checking of ears and throat. She recommended that the nurse perform a skin test for several allergens, while she was drinking coffee and reading some medical leaflets. After the test, we waited 15 minutes for the skin reaction. After 15 minutes, we entered for the second time with the doctor's child. The doctor had already written the recommendations on a piece of paper - after 12 months of life the IgE test was complete and the gastrointestinal and inhalation panel made of blood, no advice on how to use steroids and other moisturizing ointments, what to eliminate from the diet, etc. I asked if it is not possible to do a complete IgE examination now to have some broader picture of the algae, and so it led me to a second visit myself. After a week, we came forward with research - total IgE, specific for egg white and cow's milk, morphology. On a piece of paper I wrote down all the questions I want to ask so that I don't forget something because the visit is conducted in such a way as to check in with the patient as soon as possible. The second visit lasted ok . The second visit lasted about 25 minutes, but with every question the doctor was very impatient, she answered very casually and nervously, treated me from above and not like a parent who wants to know as much as possible to help his child. The doctor was not kind enough to point out that the son has a strong allergy to egg white, he came out with a high blood score and a large skin reaction and in the future there may be a problem with vaccinations because most of them are made on egg white. Another pediatrician - an allergologist - drew my attention to this, in such a case you have to be very careful because the child may have a very large allergic reaction and even anaphylactic shock! Mrs. Grzesiak went to suggest opinions on this website, no one wrote a negative opinion. I also watched the lectures of the doctor on AZS on the Internet and she did not give me anything in this knowledge during my visits! ! ! Cost of the visits: the first 180 PLN, the second 120 PLN. It is not worth spending a penny! You can find out more from the Internet. I strongly advise against"
5577,"The hotel spent 3 days ( 2 nights ) at the turn of the year - using the offer "" Devil's End of the Year "" . Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with this stay, so I do not recommend it to other travelers. The hotel, on the one hand, has quite decent equipment, an interesting location, on the other hand, an average kitchen and, what's worst, not very helpful and rude service in the owners and managers. I have the impression that the people managing this hotel are not fully prepared to run such a place, and some of their behaviour is very controversial. For example, a very high fee for a duplicate access card to a room (150 PLN - market value of the card is about 1 PLN), attempts to add high fees (500 PLN) for breaking the night's silence in the hotel bar (additionally an attempt to add a fee for waiter's work after 10 PM). Nobody paid any attention to us in any way, the waiter at 10 p.m. accepted the last orders and wishing us a nice evening in the bar he went home. As for the kitchen in the hotel restaurant there are also objections. Small portions, the chef does not pay attention to the sets offered in the menu, serving the same additions to each dish on a given day, even though the card shows something completely different. To sum up, I do not recommend this place. I have the impression that in this price you can find more pleasant and, most of all, more hospitable places, which would seem to be the same hospitality as in the Lublin region."
5578,"I was only on one visit, so maybe after the next few would be better, just that the pain didn't let me wait. The Doctor came to me with a suspicion of a broken appendix of one of the vertebrae and severe pain radiating to the whole leg. The doctor applied a puncture and a patch, which came off after 2 hours. It was not invasive, so it was cool, but in my case it was not enough. The visit didn't give me anything, so I went to the doctor for an MRI, who ordered an MRI in the first place. Of course I understand the Doctor's approach, in the first place he wants to help with simple methods and this is something cool, few doctors show such commitment, judging by the number of positive opinions the Doctor knows about things. And I recommend to everyone. I have one remark: The doctor with the plate with the picture of the spine went out to another room so I don't really know what he was watching there. I recommend that you look at the pictures with the patient, just like the other doctor she came in contact with. He showed me what is wrong and what exactly he sees in the picture and I prefer this approach. In my case, soft tissues were damaged. The beginning of the discopathy gave symptoms of sciatica, hence the pain in the whole leg. You told me that there was no fracture, because the fact that 2 years she was carrying heavy crates at work (35kg) would not cause such an injury and the other doctor stated otherwise. Of course I think the doctor would help me if I went for a few more visits, so I recommend it because I am involved in the treatment of each individual, the only objection I have to look at the pictures in a separate room, but apart from that, everything is in the best interest. Greetings."
5579,"As Professor Mirosław Jarosz , Director of the Institute of Food and Nutrition (IŻŻ) explained, the National Centre for Nutrition Education (NCEZ) was established in response to the educational needs of Poles. The new institution is to be a source of reliable knowledge about nutrition and physical activity. According to prof . Jarosz, the impulse to establish the NCEZ was the success of the project ""Keep the balance"", which was carried out between 2011 and 2016. Thanks to the dissemination of knowledge about healthy nutrition and physical activity it was possible to reduce the incidence of overweight and obesity in schools and reach millions of consumers. The project also included the education of 12 . 400 pregnant and breast-feeding women, which allowed 87% of them to keep their weight gain within normal limits and 78% of them to have a normal body weight also 6 months after giving birth."
5580,"What kind of doctor is that, who can't prescribe the drugs I want. The family doctor didn't want to prescribe me anymore and sent me to a specialist. He didn't prescribe me and told me that he didn't prescribe anything. He said they're not suitable for such a long time treatment. I've been using Afobam for 9 years and I'm alive somehow. Without him, I'd probably die. If I go in private, he should take care of me. He wanted to prescribe me something else, and I believe in his Afobam. I won't go to him again. Dr. Broncel used to be in the glows, but I think he's already gone. That's a shame. So experienced."
5581,"The alarm clock is definitely not worth 75 PLN. Advantages: nice appearance, good fit of the material, large legible numbers, loud alarm. Disadvantages: made of poor quality, cheap plastic, buttons (including alarm and naps) placed at the back, which is very impractical at night, buttons also cheesy (loud and hard). It can be disturbing: lack of backlight adjustment, battery supporting the memory in the less and less common form of 9V (there couldn't be any fingers?) . It would also be useful to adjust the alarm (e.g. from delicate to strong) ."
5582,"a doctor who has a very cool attitude towards the patient and is not interested in providing information on where more specialized tests that cannot be done in Czestochowa could be done. She simply divests the patient by saying ""there are no other possibilities of tests at the hospital"" and that is the end of the conversation."
5583,"Maybe technically, Dr. W. is good, but plastically a macabre! ! ! He does not consider individual cases, he just ""flies"". ...as the books say. And each face is a new card to write down and ""Jackon's nose"" doesn't fit everyone and not every eye can be cut the same ""cut"". This is PLASTIC Surgery.

5584,"I've stayed in Warszawianka a few times so far and usually it was a nice couple days' stay. This time he came to 'em for one night and he regretted it very much. Exactly at seven o'clock in the morning I was woken up by the sounds of renovation, or to be precise, banging a hammer right behind my wall. . . . .thought I'd hold 'em up, I'd fall asleep. . . . .I gave up when the drill came into play at eight o'clock! Dear Warszawianka, I understand and applaud the need for renovation, I also understand that in days with full occupancy someone has to be neighboring with this renovation. . . . .but not to warn the visitor about this fact and not to give him a choice I do not understand a bit! ! ! It's a pity, because the rest of the stay as always was at least correct and he would rather compliment you."
5585,"Unfortunately, I don't have a good opinion of the Doctor's expertise. She has always had problems with her menstruation. After years of moving me from one specialist to another - she found me to the Doctor, who does conduct a long interview but does not listen to the answers, yes, he prescribes referrals for examinations, but not those for which it is necessary (although the doctor directing me recommended other examinations, the Doctor said that he knows better - life has shown that everyone needs humility, even those with prof . before his name) . He did not diagnose me with the disease, but even assured me that I have the results in a book (although he ordered a prolactin test, but only a single-phase test instead of a three-phase one and it would come out immediately). And so it was for years and the treatment of patients by doctors such as the doctor has been hypoprolactics and adenoma on the pituitary gland. . . . . . .I still remember his words: ""He wanted me to be as healthy as you. . . Irregular menstruation is your beauty, not your condition. . . ""I advise against"
5586,"Researchers took care of the patent applications - they cover detailed parts of the process, the whole construction of the ""Trojan horse"" and its application. The owner of the patent is the company Cellis - start - up biotechnological. Within the company of prof . The king deals with the commercialization of an innovative method. The researcher points out that although start - up biotechnological is a high-risk company, its establishment will always be considered a successful venture. As she mentions, at the beginning she lacked knowledge about intellectual property protection. She was first persuaded to acquire and apply it by her colleagues from the University of La Sapienza in Italy, where she presented her research. In Poland, prof . The king was among the first and few scientists who established a start - upy . Cellis was established in 2016. At the Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW) basic research on the discovered mechanism was and is being carried out, and within the framework of the start - ups research aimed at the development of therapy was started."
5587,"I've been using for 5 months and I'm rather on it. First the advantages: nice appearance, good working spout and adjustment handle. It is a pity that there are no other elements of this model (single faucets, shower faucets) with PVD coating, because it has a different color than the usual chrome and may not fit a little bit to the rest of the mixers in the bathroom (I do not mind). The disadvantage of the set is the handset shower. First of all, even if you turn off the water, the handset will drip water for a while. It doesn't help to flip over, shake or switch the strainer to different types of showers - from the handset put in its place it has to drip the rest of the water. The second thing is that after 3 months of normal use the hose to the handset has broken down. Admittedly, I got a new one 2 days after the notification, but I still think that the company, which boasts a 5-year warranty on the boxes (but please read the warranty card - for what is the 5-year warranty), should not happen (of course, I had to replace the hose on my own in the already built up bath)."
5588,"The opinion about the hotel itself is ""half a half"" ; ) The hotel is good for people who want to sleep somewhere, eat delicious food (but without the madness and the stinging) and go sightseeing. It did not recommend the hotel to families with small children as well, because it was not too clean as for the conditions for small children. The advantages of the place is its location, easy to get by bus to different places, close to two beautiful beaches, wonderful view and delicious food. The downside is the lack of lobby (with the shopping arcade entering the rooms and strangers everywhere), the lack of soap or dishwashing liquid in the rooms, a little too little clean (especially the floor). Generally it was fine ; ) The rooms were well equipped: fridge, cooker, microwave, juicer, toaster, iron, dryer, TV set, full kitchen equipment."
5589,"I advise you not to be a doctor who is supposed to start a pregnancy. I came to him with information that I'm going to try - no tests, no questions. On my information that I have very irregular cycles he said that you have to lose a year and then you will see. There may be ovulation tests. Iny doctor immediately did the ugs and monitoring the cycle. Besides, I was very insensitive to the test and on my attention that it quite painful said ""it will get worse at birth"". I do not recommend"
5590,"She went to Dr. Jack for 3 years. Initially, everything was great, she landed at his place with menstrual atrophy, etc . Nice, factual quite a bit but very busy. . . For 3 years when she was his patient, he didn't examine me once - . - He gave me a referral for ultrasound and hormones, I think maybe that's the way it should be. Then the pregnancy, after the hormone treatment. . . . .miscarriage. I was still in it thinking it was the best of the 5 gynaecologists I've ever had. She offered it to my friend, we went together. But after some time I was recommended to Dr. Emilia Świetlicka. So I went to her out of curiosity, also enrolling a colleague. I'll add that a month ago we were still with Dr. Jack. The examination, the services included in the price of the visit, everything's great. . . I came out of the office in severe shock. A colleague I came with had an oversized oversight that was eligible for surgery a few months ago! Worst of all, Dr. Jacek Wogole did not see her during the examination. . . . A colleague got an immediate referral for the surgery, she was taken cancer swabs. . . . .and we are still wondering how such an experienced doctor as Dr. Jacek did not see, did not feel it? I do not judge him. Everyone has a right to make mistakes. However, it was his obvious oversight. . . ,"
5591,"Well, unfortunately, I'm not entirely satisfied with your last visit to the Doctor. . . She always went to her without any stress for tests, and when she miscarried me and immediately afterwards it turned out that I was pregnant - she did not even test me because . . . . .too early and she won't see anything - maybe too early, but she barely miscarried me and it should have been examined. She told me to come in two weeks. At first she didn't want money. . . . .because. . . . . .for which. . : ...and when I asked, 'Really? "" she replied. . . ""Well, that's 50 zloty. All in all, for the fact that she said she wouldn't see anything and that I'd come in two weeks. . She went a week later to another doctor - the heart was already beating, the doctor detected a hemorrhagic cyst. After 2 weeks she went to the Doctor because she trusted me and wanted me to lead my pregnancy, but from her mouth she heard a different opinion - that it was a yellow body. . . She ran nervous to another doctor and confirmed that it was a hemorrhagic cyst and that it was already pouring out. . . Well, unfortunately, but she lost my trust in the doctor. . . . .which is a shame. . . The doctor shouldn't be mistaken in such a situation. . . The yellow body (as I know it myself) is in a different place. . . . ."
5592,"In a nutshell: the whole group did, did not dismiss anyone. Dream evaluations . So much : - )"
5593,"I've been trying to get a child for 3 years. One thing is that probably nobody has given us as much time as he has. I guess the visit was an hour. I got pregnant after the ""entanglement"" with many gynaecologists without his help ; ) We did it. . . Thank you. He was right, a nice guy."
5594,"No garbage bags, but it's a small inconvenience compared to the appalling amount of dust D: it just repels and disgusting (I enclose a photo and point out that the worst few centimeters of dust is on my hand , uuugh ! ) D : the lack of possibility to control all the lights from the bed is also disappointing, not to mention the shower door which in this ibis provides even less privacy than usual ; c but the service although nice. I don't think I'm coming back here no matter what the price."
5595,"As Dr. Pieczykolan explained, clinical practice shows that molecules effective against cancer cells also cause damage to the patient's healthy tissue and organs, often leading to devastating complications. The solution to the problem of cancer, as well as to most diseases of civilization, would be a therapy meeting the criteria of Paul Ehrlich's idea, the so-called ""golden ball"". that would hit the target perfectly - transformed, damaged cells. Such an ideal molecule, using all means of transport available to the body, such as blood and lymph, would only reach the cancer-changed cells and destroy them. Such an assumption lies at the heart of the ONCO - 3 CLA project, as well as many targeted therapies being developed around the world. The Polish therapy consists of three levels of activation . In the first stage, the natural mechanism of perforation, i.e. loosening and destroying connections between blood vessel cells, is used in the neoplastic process. Through cracks in vessel epithelium, drugs can penetrate from blood to cancer. Moreover, the molecule is constructed in such a way that it recognizes certain receptors on the surface of cancer cells and connects only with these cells."
5596,"I have no objection to the doctor's work. The examination was done gently, she was informed about its results and further treatment, in addition, she received a number of referrals and Ms. Julia did not prescribe hastily - this is a great plus. However, the approach to the patient could have been simply nicer, the atmosphere in the office was quite tense and I had the impression that the doctor was annoyed. Perhaps she found me on a worse day, so I do not cross out Julia too hastily and probably I will come back, because she is a very factual doctor :)"
5597,"Very neat guesthouse in a quiet area. Nice service, clean and pleasant. Royal breakfast, real coffee from the coffee machine ( !) In the neighborhood interesting Museum of Magical Realism ""Ochorowiczówka"". Our room was small, so we felt a lack of common space where we could sit and read on an armchair. The overall impression was very positive."
5598,"It's been a month since the visit, and I keep thinking about it all. Maybe it's my bad luck, maybe bad expectations about the visit. I don't want to go into the details of my health, so I'll be brief. The doctor misread the ultrasound and found me pregnant. And after the above mentioned statement he stopped answering any other questions about my condition, which was the real purpose of the visit. I left the office without any referrals for examinations (even those confirming my pregnancy). On Friday evening, she quickly arranged an appointment with another doctor and a referral for a beta Hcg test to have a full picture of her situation. Emotionally - an unpleasant and difficult experience ."
5599,"I am very impressed with the cleanliness of this hotel. The building has been newly renovated and smells of freshness, until it is nice to stay there. The hotel is spacious, bright, with large windows. The hotel is a very bright hotel with large windows. The rooms and bathrooms are cleaned without any problems, towels are changed every day, and other bathroom items are changed. Nice staff, children's entertainers great. The food was surprisingly good, especially the children enjoyed the local food. Holiday super : )"
5600,"WARNING ! ! ! ! I stayed overnight from 30 to 31 July, I was bitten by PLUSKWY in the room on the first floor, room 105 or 108, 300 bites, money spent on drugs and ointments, no compensation, hotel in a strange place, the fear of going out in the evening, for hot water you have to wait some time, poor standard of rooms, stayed overnight also in winter, through the windows blows. But the worst is the PLUSKY! ! ! to Poland these days. . . . .I strongly advise against and do not recommend"
5601,"Hotel in a super location . Every morning opening a window in the room overlooking the sea . The hotel was clean, the rooms were cleaned very thoroughly. The hotel staff was very nice, the gentleman in the bar had fun with us. The food was very good. The hotel is not a big facility so it has its own atmosphere. It has its own years, but it still looks very nice. If someone is looking for luxury it is not a hotel for him. I recommend it! !"
5602,I don't recommend this hotel. Dirty dirty and dirty again. We were in the hotel 2 days. The climax goes so loudly that you can't sleep. The walls are dirty in the corners of the cobwebs with spiders. Bathroom total mess. Curtains in the bathroom window all in mushroom. Blleeeeeeeeee toilet . shower so disgusting that even in the flip-flops I felt disgusted to enter. It smells musty in the room. TIP. breakfast croissant coffee tea a glass of juice . The croissant was good but only one more. Better to pay.
5603,"I don't recommend it to smokers! ! ! Before booking, I was informed that you can smoke on the hotel terrace. . It is not possible because it was still closed. Besides, someone from the service tried to enter my room without knocking. . . .when he found out someone was inside, he ran away quickly. . . (I couldn't explain who entered the room and why). I've never seen such an unpleasant situation in any hotel. Just in case, I advise you to avoid it. ."
5604,"We went to the meeting at the invitation of our friends, who were satisfied. The biggest advantage of the hotel was its price. One by one: 1 . Nobody knows anything and everyone is in place of someone. Starting with the receptionist, through waiters, bartender or animator. Total disinformation. The receptionist told me to sign the confirmation of payment of the advance payment because she did not have it in the system (similarly 6 families of our friends who came with us). And since he paid 'em, gave 'em dates, names, etc., who is taking the confirmation with him? 2 . Rooms - dirty bathrooms, dirty and damaged furniture, stained carpet. 3 . Green school organized in the hotel in parallel. . . If I wanted to spend the weekend with my friends in the company of 200 roaring kids and the school charm, I would have signed up as a tour guide and not gone to the 4 * hotel. 4 . Food . Definitely not crazy. Hungry nobody walked, but really strongly medium (cheapest sausages, mortadella sausage, chicken meat, some fish, the same salad and salad for 3 days). 5 . Basin actually a pool with cloudy water . Dark, overwhelming, elements of the ceiling lying on the bottom (lumps of plaster in the water) The peak of everything was when someone left the hatch to the engine room open, nothing secured, in the dark part of the pool, where small children were running. Fortunately, nobody fell in. 6 no illumination - dark corridors, and on the 3rd day only the emergency light worked, to find a place for the key you had to touch the door, not to mention finding the room (without the phone illumination impossible) From the cool: Location Quality to price My wife summarized this hotel as strong 3 * Egyptian ;) maybe even a little bit of Egyptian decoration was flooded. . ."
5606,"She treated me with this doctor for over two years. She went to him because at that time ( 6 years ago ) he was considered a good specialist according to the opinions circulating in the city. At the beginning she didn't pay attention to the character of the doctor, because his ""professionalism"" was very high and she didn't want me to suggest what he was like. This was not the most important thing then. She bit my teeth on unpleasant comments from the doctor's mouth and believed that he would cure me. He kept ordering me private tests, prescribing medication. It was really a lot. The question is, was it necessary? Well, my dear, it wasn't. I kept getting the same results that she did every 2 max 3 months. She spent more than 400 PLN on drugs. She felt worse and worse. From a ""healthy"" patient, who was m, she was becoming more and more ""ailing"" every month. My psyche started to sit down. The doctor said that I had very bad results. She believed in it and she was making me sick. The medication caused a lot of side effects which made me feel really bad. In the name of wanting to have a child, I was still tired. After the medication, she gained 20 kg of weight during those two years! She woke up to me when the doctor fell asleep on a private visit! She thought to me: how can such a doctor treat me well if he is not aware of what he is writing on the prescription? ! This was my last visit to this doctor. From now on I don't go to doctors in private anymore. She found me a good doctor at NFZ. During the last visit she showed him the results of tests from that period of treatment by Tomasz Milewicz. The doctor said that the results were not bad! ! ! So she came to the conclusion that the doctor made me feel very sick, then I will go to him and pay for the visits. I suspect that this was the tactic of doctor Milewicz. Fortunately now I am older and wiser, so I warn you about this doctor. He didn't help me, but he just hurt and cleaned his wallet."
5607,"Hello, actually I can't write anything new, most of the accusations I've encountered in this ranking, concerning Dr. Markuszewski, are as true as possible. Diagnosis ""to the eye"" without any tests, (I didn't even suppose that some mysterious variety of diabetes can be found in the patient, looking deep into her eyes). The uncomfortable atmosphere during the visit - for the first time I encountered such arrogant behaviour at the doctor's, he hardly listened at all to what I had to say, but he immediately accused me of his conclusions ""announced from the height of his medical chair"". I would strongly advise against it all. Taking into account the price of his services, the length of treatment, the lack of effects, the attribution of the same ailments to all women and the arrogance already mentioned, I consider him to be absolutely the worst gynaecologist with whom I had to deal."
5608,"I am proud that there is such a beautiful hotel in our country! I thank the investor for the costs of design. She spent a few days in the hotel at the turn of 2012 / 2013 with her husband and daughter. And a revelation ! Do not forget to visit the Museum of the City of Lodz, which is located in the phenomenal Poznañ Palace a few steps away from the hotel. For lunch I recommend a lovely and tasty Ristorante Marcello, also next to the hotel. We were only missing a room/ playroom for the children in the hotel - I hope it is a matter of time. But there was no problem with attractions for children in the area - a fairy tale museum, a palm house, a playroom in the nearby Manufactura. A tiny minus for an underground car park - she certainly wouldn't be able to manoeuvre out - too narrowly. I wish everyone an equally successful stay ; - )"
5609,"The hotel is renovated / reconstructed and still smells of novelty, the rooms are large and well equipped: safe, bathrobe, kettle, bar. Impressive sports facilities: air-conditioned hall (tennis with ball machine, badminton, wall), volleyball, basketball, squash, fitness, horses, golf, football fields, bicycles including batteries, indoor and outdoor pool, spa. Great food for both breakfast and dinner. I recommend HB . Unfortunately: in the heat of over 30 degrees the air conditioning in the rooms ""does not work"" despite the maximum setting, which generates a lot of noise, so it was difficult to fall asleep. Attention to the basement rooms is 6 (2001 - 2006), it did not concern me, but it may happen to someone. The water in the pool is too hot, especially in such heat, good for doing laundry and not for people. After my intervention, it was lowered in the indoor pool and I could swim my own kilometer, but the first half of the week's stay went to waste. The first half of the week's stay went to waste. The location is beautiful, I recommend sunsets, but outside the resort there is nothing to do (no hiking or cycling trails unless someone likes to ride on the road without a roadside) . The night club is a disaster. The club is a nightclub. The club is a nightclub that is not very professional (hello to David), a weak DJ (he plays the titles and not rhythms to dance, he does not understand what is being said to him) no wonder that the club shines empty and the only reasonable attraction is bowling at an exaggerated price of 80 zł / h (as I understand too many willing for the reasons mentioned above) Another thing is the way to pay the room not to carry a credit card or cash for example to the pool. The system has been reported incorrectly in some places that I do not have such a credit supposedly because of the implementation of new software , which should not be a problem for a hotel guest . The cafe staff have managed to do this, but no longer a ""robot"". I'm not a computer scientist. David in a nightclub, sending 2 times a guest of a 4-star hotel to the reception desk to explain it to himself (as I understand it, the hotel management informed the staff about software problems) Access to the current press (important in this remote area) 2 out of 3 times I managed to buy, once they did not bring in that day at all. In the evening hours it has features of adult discrimination. During the dinner the children push themselves on the stage, a large part of the performances is addressed only to them, in the nightclub even to 23 despite the information that after 19 this one you have to be 18 years old."
5610,"""In our society, even among doctors, there is still a conviction that influenza is a minor disease. Meanwhile, even the official data are underestimated, because the actual incidence of influenza, as well as the deaths, is much more,"" - said Prof . Antczak said. The national consultant in the field of pediatrics, Prof . Teresa Jackowska said that in the Bielanski Hospital in Warsaw, where she works, only 16% of the staff, including the administration of the facility, were vaccinated in the past influenza season. Those who do not vaccinate are a threat to patients. Healthcare workers, just like other people, may not even realize that they are infecting others, because 33% of infections are asymptomatic."
5612,"A specific man, but I liked the fact that he talks to the patient, explains everything to him and not just notes something to himself and the man does not even know what is wrong with him. I am satisfied, a pleasant clinic, you can do the examination on the spot, you don't have to run these and the inside."
5613,"Just a nice hotel location. Staff employed, completely randomly. Complete lack of professionalism . The water in the cold pool, with the Jacuzzi you have to leave, to push a button, to keep it working. To the zoo, which you have to pay for, even though you pay a lot of money for your stay, you have to take your binoculars to see any animal. Additional fees would be most welcome for using the toilet or elevator. A beautiful place, badly managed and completely unused. The cottages on the trees should be called cottages between the trees, because that's the way it is. The food is terrible. I recommend that managers get to know the idea of a Swedish table. The cheapest sausages and cheese for breakfast, and dinner for 65 zloty, leaves a lot to be desired as well. The money is completely discarded. A, no wi fi - embarrassment."
5614,"I am very glad that I found Mrs. Doctor, for several years I was treated for acne in various dermatologists, everyone always prescribed antibiotics, but after the medicines were stopped, everything came back. The Doctor prescribed me to make ointments, after which the acne practically disappeared (after just a week of lubrication an amazing difference). The disadvantage is a big time slip (I was admitted 40 minutes later than I was registered - a private visit) and despite the agreed time we had to wait. Perhaps it is because the Doctor devotes as much time to everyone as I need. I generally recommend : ]"
5615,"approach to the child cool with distance . It does not try in any way to distract the child from the examination . To open the child's mouth, the nose is blocked. Besides, he goes out for a 10-minute break when he has knocked out the visit time . I do not recommend that parents who care about their child should not be afraid of the doctor ."
5616,"I have been treated by Luke since the beginning of February. I have been examined by many specialists in various fields of medicine. Orthopaedists made a diagnosis, sciatica, but the treatment was completely ineffective. . There were a lot of symptoms. Luke and I worked on the whole body. I was involved in autotherapy, I was taught which section of the body (neck, shoulders, shoulders, blades, sternum, barely, cross, abdominal side, groin, hip, thigh and shank). Slowly it becomes independent. Luke has so much knowledge about the human body and psyche that in the company of his loved ones I call him a ""miracle worker"". The information about the diseases he treats is not fiction. He is a fellow man who cares about his paternity and not about his money. After visits to about 30 doctors I am ready to recommend him only because he surprises me with the accuracy of the diagnosis all the time. I'm going to have to attend to Him for the next six months because only Luke was able to help me and forget about the pain that I was crying through at night. So no thanks yet: )"
5618,"The tires surprised me that they are very soft. It's about the sides of the tyre. Despite the purchase of 94W type tyres, the tyre causes uncertainty in driving. It is not until the front and rear 2, 8, 3 bars and 2, 4, 2, 6 bars are inflated that you can somehow drive. Even at this pressure, with the wheels turned at a standstill, the tyres look as if they have too little air. He asked 'em questions to the manufacturer on his website, no response. Among the many positive opinions, he found 'em also similar to mine and now unfortunately he convinced 'em that this someone was right."
5619,"The procedure itself to remove the detained eight was professional. However, the doctor in a private clinic only removes teeth, before and after the procedure there is no contact with him at all. In case of complications, the dentists from the clinic do not call the doctor themselves and make recommendations. Unfortunately, it may end up as in my case - a dislocated jaw and the need to wear a splint may be possible for the rest of my life."
5620,"This is our second stay at the hotel, this time they took Mom with them to show us where we are staying during our weekend trips to The Tall Ships Races in Szczecin. We were given rooms next to each other as we wished, even to my surprise we could check in before 10 am. We were also given 3 vouchers for a welcome drink. For members of Le Club Accorhotels there is also a VIP gift, the famous Marciński croissant, which is so tasty that on my way back from the regatta I stop specially for an hour in Poznan (and we travel by train) to be able to buy them in the hotel's confectionery for the rest of the family, so that they can experience this taste. I think that because of this early check-out I was forgotten somewhere there, but in the morning when I check out I got 'em a package much richer ; - ) Apart from delicious breakfasts rich in all kinds of products, we also used the restaurant. Dumplings, soups, but also desserts are delicious. In one of the rooms the air-conditioning didn't quite work, but frankly, it's the type of controller that I don't like. I can never ""get along with it""; - ) To sum up, we will come back for sure, because above all the atmosphere is worth it. At every step we felt like home. Greetings!"
5621,"I'm writing my review straight from my room at the Manor Hotel. At the hour. 23, despite requests to the reception desk, the courtyard, where most of the balconies, including mine, are located, is exposed to a loudspeaker and the whole regulator transmits music from a certain entertainment radio station. The staff at my complaint answered that ""you have to take into account that this is a hotel"" ( ! ! ! ! ) . What was that supposed to mean, I'm going to find out tomorrow from the manager, the manager etc . On Saturday, weddings are held here (music also directly under the rooms and in the courtyard = no possibility of sleeping before 3 a.m.) . Another unpleasant surprise is the presence of colonies of Ukrainian children aged ok . 6 - 12 years old . The microscopic beach is occupied by them all the time. In the spa area they can occupy the sauna in fifteen years, the others play with the door from the steam bath and jump into the pool. The idea of combining the holiday of private persons (couples, families) with the colonies is the first time I have seen it, and it is a total bust, which was not possible to predict when booking."
5622,"""After the completion of this project, we hope to see others implemented in cooperation with prof. Kurzątkowski . I do not hide that for us chemists this project is not created, but the problem to be solved is partly chemical, so we were invited to it. The fact that the representatives of WHO visited us is typical for such grants. We have experience with ESA (European Space Agency), for which we are currently completing one project and starting another in February. ESA and WHO have similar procedures"" - added Trykowski . In the Instrumental Analysis Laboratory, scientists use apparatus to study the structure of solids and the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the chemical composition of solids and liquids. The Laboratory is equipped with the most modern equipment . The unit's employees specialize in developing experimental aspects of qualitative and quantitative analysis of solids surface."
5623,"I am far from judging anyone, let alone a doctor. I realize that not always everything depends on them. One will help the other not. What matters to me is knowing that the doctor tries, that he wants to, that he tries to do something, that he fights for the patient. No matter what his motives are, whether ambivalent or material or any other, but he tries, he fights. I think that's the kind of doctor that Dr. Bishop is. Pawlik. We met in the hospital where at first I was unconscious. However, when she was regaining my consciousness, I had the impression that Dr. Pawlik appeared immediately. In these Maya's, it even seemed to me that he did not go home at all. Luckily, everything went well. Now, from time to time, I appear at the check-ups at dr. Pawlik where I am always treated professionally. He is nice, accessible, he has time for me. For every question I will get comprehensive answers. I am in his office and I know that he is focused on my ailments. He is competent and I need it. I don't want to impose a doctor on anyone. Everyone is looking for the best for themselves, but if you are not determined, try Dr . Pavlik. I recommend it! That sounded like a call at a rally."
5624,"Mockery ! ! ! It started with a problem with finding a parking space - unguarded, paid extra 20 PLN / day. Later it was only worse ... A double room with a higher ( ! ! ! ! ) standard, with a view of cars and dog excrement. Instead of a bed - 2 connected mattresses, no fridge, no air conditioning, in the bathroom except hand soap, no cosmetics, TV in the form of a tiny computer monitor, SAT TV - 5 channels including one German and 1 with powerful interference. At 9 pm - barely warm water ... Dirty! ! ! Dirty food! For breakfast, one type of bread, extremely disgusting coffee, stale cold meat, max 2 types of yellow cheese ... Other dishes - eggs, jelly with vegetables and salad served in such a form that at the sight of the meal you will be reluctant to eat. You can choose between bread, lard, cucumbers, frozen dumplings, rice and meat that does not smell as fresh. The local grocery shopping in the local store ended up... The Noisy SPA is a tiny squalid pool and jacuzzi. Treatments not available after an hour. 16 . 30 ... So far I do not know how the ""hotel"" received 4 stars . And all this for 700 pln / 2 nights ... NEVER AGAIN! ! !"
5625,"The musicians often fill their free time with music. Just like athletes, young people. In the opinion of the IFiPS expert, music must be present in our lives, but you must dose it wisely. ""If we use headphones, let's use large, earbuds. They are much better quality. Avoid those placed in the ear canal that disrupt the pressure in the inner ear. This causes a problem with physiological noise protection. The effect of clogged ears and tinnitus often appears. Currently, smartphones are equipped with a + nipple + - a perfectly holding plug which is pushed into the ear. These are these intra-channel headphones. When we use them only for conversations - nothing happens. But if the exposure to such a sound lasts for hours, even if the sounds are not very loud, it leads to fatigue and changes in the ears"" - warns the expert."
5628,"I believe that Dr Tomasz Dydymski is a top-notch specialist. He is perfectly trained theoretically and has vast practical knowledge despite his young age! In my case, his help consisted in professional (plastic) stitching of a very deep nose wound, which was the result of an unlucky accident, to which I suffered. I wanted to keep as little trace as possible of the deep wound (scar). Therefore, on the day of the accident, I called the doctor and asked him for urgent help. I was very anxious for the doctor to receive me on the same day as my wound required sewing. Mr. Tomasz fulfilled my request and on the same day he treated the wound and put 10 stitches on my nose, which guaranteed the perfect growth of the torn skin. Before the treatment he told me exactly what his interference in my wound will be and what next steps he will take. All the information was given in a concrete and understandable way. I praise his extremely nice and kind approach to the patient!"
5632,"The atmosphere in B&B is very friendly, Mr. Lukas is very positive, open and helpful. This is the first place where I felt at home. The Ace Apartments in the very centre of Trieste, located in a beautiful building on the main square, spacious and very clean; the bathrooms are large and fully equipped. Nearby are tourist attractions, a pier, cafés and restaurants. An ideal place for a trip with friends and family: ) The price is variable in comparison with the location, atmosphere and conditions. I am sure we will be back to Afgittacamere Loujas often: )"
5633,"Very good location of the hotel. Rooms are spacious, clean and equipped with everything you need during your stay. From the balcony of the room, sea view and hotel parking. The food is very good, and a wide range of dishes during the holidays. For me a successful stay in this hotel and worth recommending! ! !"
5634,"""These are people of all ages, young and old - we wish everyone a long life and good health, of course"" she stressed. As she added, people who report this will to the PO are aware of their decision. ""People also ask for anonymity and discretion, which of course we do. In most cases the decision is also agreed with the family, which respects this will of the deceased, although there are cases where there are some objections from relatives,"" she said. According to Prof. Bruska, during exercises with students, future doctors can maintain proper respect for the human body. ""Students know that having classes on the human body or any preparations of human origin, they must behave properly and handle the human body with due respect. They are also aware that in such conditions and on a corpse they can learn more than on phantoms or models,"" she stressed."
5635,"Encouraged by positive opinions and beautiful photos of the hotel and aquapark, we went with our boyfriend for a romantic weekend to Hotel Klimek. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. The hotel may have deserved four stars, but that was probably a decade ago. We were in many hotels with three stars, and even in guesthouses where the standard was much higher for a lower price. The pictures on the website are so beautified that you might be surprised to see everything live, also the aquapark zone, which in the pictures seems to be quite large, in fact it is just small. The cobwebs on the lamp in the four-star hotel are also unacceptable to me. However, the thing that completed the scourge of bitterness were the hollow and frayed bathrobes. I find it embarrassing to give such a thing to guests. With the few advantages that I can mention. . . the service was nice, the breakfast buffet was quite ok, a large selection of sausages, cheeses etc . To sum up, I don't recommend it, you can be disappointed."
5636,"Hotel Sancho I is located ok . 10 min walk from the historic sites of Lisbon . There is a bus stop nearby from which you can get to the airport. The hotel staff is competent and very friendly. The room where she lived was small but clean, comfortable and quiet."

This solution combines the knowledge of, among others, medicine, microbiology and textiles. Its advantage over traditional forms of therapy including steam baths is the convenience of use.

5640,"Comparing in detail the facilities that have their presentations on both sites, Airbnb received more positive ratings. There are many reasons for this and of course they are complex. Researchers in the published report have highlighted four of them: herd behaviour, which is compounded by the impact of previous ratings. The failure to publish negative opinions for fear of an equally negative rematch. The service allows two pages of comments. Self - selection - own choice . If you are potentially more interested in the product, you will be satisfied with it and will express a positive opinion ."
5641,"I can tell you in full knowledge that I have never before met such a great doctor. The doctor is aptly choosing the treatment that is effective, but it is his approach to the human being that deserves the highest marks. Each time the doctor is extremely polite but also very committed to talking to the patient, I have never felt that he is impatient with my questions, on the contrary, he answers all the questions I ask him with a smile. You can see that he is a doctor by vocation, and that it is really difficult to find such a doctor. I highly recommend this doctor, I know that no one will be disappointed."
5643,"Calm here, I'll agree and patients may like it, but I don't recommend it. Why? Because with today's diseases and their complications you have to be a real doctor. It seems to me that he approached my case very template. She had joint pains, they lasted up to 24 hours, then she disappeared for a day or two, then she was fine, the pain just followed me ""walked"" (today I have joint pains in my wrist in two days e.g. . in my knee). The interview which about the disease with me did it when she did my gynaecological, dental examination and sent to the laryngologist. I'll tell you that these tests were ok. He prescribed a cure for arthritis. The pain didn't go away. This nightmare of mine lasted somewhere from year 1, 5. Eventually I found myself at a doctor in Rzeszow (for a health insurance fund) After describing the pain she referred me to a boleriosis and chlamydia test. It turned out that I had chlamydia. Appropriate dose of antibiotic and inflammatory airing medicine and after the problem ! ! ! !"
5644,"A good doctor doesn't have to be nice, he has to be competent. About the ""doctor"" I can neither say. My only visit to her took place the day after the pregnancy test (positive) . My husband and I were excited to see a gynaecologist. During the ultrasound, the doctor said that I was actually pregnant and when both my husband and I were crying, she asked us outrageously, ""What are you yelling about? "" . Nothing. She wrote me down the folic acid and told me to take no - spe plus hormones because I had pains in my abdomen. She told me to come in two weeks. That's it! She did not order any tests - neither blood nor hormones, she did not even measure my pressure! Oh, she said that if I'm going to break it, I don't have to worry. The girls you defend ""Doctor"" - is that professional behavior? A patient comes in in her first pregnancy, she says she's in pain and the doctor doesn't order any tests, she doesn't talk, she tells me to come and see you in two weeks - is that ok? I came out of her office stressed, capable, confused and guilty of being pregnant! Luckily now I go to a doctor who is not only competent, communicative but also gives me a sense of security and my pregnancy is going well: )"

The invoice was supposed to be on the spot, and it turned out that there wouldn't be at all, at most on the e-mail, because ""there was no boss"". It was terribly loud from the street."
5655,"Close to station S - bahnu , local shopping center I cannstatter wasen ( 15 minutes on foot ) . The rooms are warm, there is a safe and a small bottle of water. When we arrived at 22 and got the key to the room, it turned out to be unclean. As a consequence, after a long time, we were given a room for one night in an old building, not renovated and what is worse, with a window overlooking some pub, where to 4 . 30 permanent chants . Despite the closed windows, we could not sleep. The next morning (at 10 a.m.) our room was still not ready, so we had to leave our luggage at the reception and only in the afternoon could we move in. The price of 85 Euros per night was very inadequate. The kitchen is only equipped with a coffee maker - no kettle, plates or cutlery."
5656,"I don't recommend it, Doctor! On the basis of the hospital records, in which the observation of bronchial asthma was written, without any additional examinations, she only listened to the child and found bronchial asthma! ! A failure, as in a 2-year-old child, without any laboratory tests, can such a thing be found? ! 120 PLN thrown into the mud, we are looking for another doctor."
5657,"A very good place to visit Dresden. The hotel has a category * * Superior, but when it comes to room and service, it quietly meets the 3 * requirements. We had a family room with one double bed and one bunk bed; and with air conditioning. The room was very clean, daily cleaned, bed linen, refilled and changed towels. In terms of cleanliness, nothing can get attached to anything. A nice surprise was that on the hot days after returning to the room it was cool, the staff left the air conditioning on. This is unthinkable in other hotels, where saving electricity is a high priority. An additional advantage is the free hotel parking, which is a rare occurrence in Dresden and European cities in general. Now the minus is breakfast. A person used to the 3 - 4 * standard in Polish hotels will be unpleasantly surprised. Due to the lack of typical cuisine there are practically no hot dishes. The only exception was eggs cooked in an ovary. In addition, there was a vending machine (a big plus) with a large selection: water for tea, coffee, espresso, latte, cocoa. The small selection of bread, the level of cold cuts and cheeses does not wash to Polish cuisine - mortadella, salceson and the like. The absence of indispensable scrambled eggs and sausages, not to mention slices of bacon. No fresh cheeses, no sweet coffee snacks. All products in mini boxes - jam, honey, butter, cheese, pâté-like products . To sum up - breakfast does not knock down, however, the traveler will enjoy a peaceful holiday. Taking into account the still relatively attractive price for breakfast as for Dresden - 7, 5 EUR adult, 3 EUR child - with an average of 10 EUR per person - it is worth considering its purchase. Most importantly, the hotel is very close to the old town. Next to it is Yenidze, and after a 10-minute walk we reach Zwinger Palace, where the Baroque madness begins - Zwinger marathon, Semporoper, Residentschloss, Hofkirche, Frauenkirche, Albertinum. . . . To sum up, the hotel is a good place to recommend. Quite an attractive price for a great location. And of course free parking. And a clean room. Breakfast - you can eat. If you don't want to pay 7,5 EUR for a morning meal, you can buy yourself 1,3 EUR tea or coffee at the vending machine and have breakfast on your own."
5658,"The worst doctor I know, I have an injury to this doctor. I was operated on when I was 12 years old with a small surgery on my knee, but something broke off and blocked it. It was still swollen and I couldn't move properly. I was in the orthopaedic ward at the time it was still on Staszic. I waited three weeks for a surgery that lasted half an hour, I still don't know why it took so long. After the removal, when the bone chrysalis turned out to be a cure, I could run and jump and I was cured, but there was still something wrong. The leg was still unstable. I didn't play ball with the guys in the yard anymore. As it turned out a few years later I had my ligament ripped off as he might have overlooked it. After consultations in private clinics, I had another operation. This doctor still has a problem with my knee."
5661,"I went with my girlfriend for the weekend to the hotel we chose raspberry city . Everything is beautiful. . . In the pictures, the price is 80 zł per night. In the bathroom, stone translucent faucets in the shower, in the sink, someone's hair was visible (I will not write from where). The quilts had already survived there probably half a century because they were tattered and there was only a pillowcase on them in which there were no buttons anyway. Generally I do not recommend !"
5662,"They sound terribly weak. I'm not an audiophile and I didn't expect any miracles, but I can't listen to music on them because it just sounds different than anywhere else. First of all, the middle tones are strangely muted. Under the second, the highs and lows even when they are set to zero are too high. So it turns out that a song that you know by heart and have heard on various more expensive and cheaper speakers and sounded quite similar, here it just ( not ) sounds different . I tried to combine it with the knobs for bass and treble, but so far I haven't been able to make any sense of it. He also thought that maybe it's mine to see and after a while I'll just get used to it but it's not."
5663,"Hello. Dr. Agrawal led my 2 pregnancies, the birth was light and the children were given 10 points each. Visits to Dr. Agrawal may not be cheap, the examinations have to be watched and done also for a fee, in the office you almost always have to wait about 1 or 5 hours despite the appointed time but since she met me in 2005 I had no doubt that she will lead my pregnancies. I trust her, you can always ask her about everything and she is never indifferent to the slightest doubt. My pregnancies have not been easy because in both to the end of 5 m - ca she had m nausea and vomiting. I admit that I am not a very consistent person and did not always use m regularly what you recommended dr - mea culpa . I think that my good preparation for both childbirth and motherhood is due to Dr. Agrawal. I recommend her books, especially for those whose visits sometimes last very shortly, after all, when everything is okay, why should they last longer? When she had a problem and asked me to visit her, she never sent me back, probably that's where the queues come from, because she accepts everyone who asks for an urgent visit. One of the reasons she was looking for a gynecologist was that since 1990 I have been a vegetarian (I don't eat meat or fish) and she was looking for a person I could trust who would dispel my fears that this diet could be dangerous for pregnancy. The second reason is that I don't trust too much in conventional medicine and here again she found me what I had been fond of, because the doctor recommends natural methods, herbs, healthy eating, rest. . . Today I eat in 5 weeks of pregnancy and I have no doubt who will lead her. I am glad that we have Dr. Agrawal in Wroclaw and I think she is a wonderful, warm, wise woman and a good gynaecologist."
5664,"If someone suggests these opinions, I strongly advise against buying these tyres. I ride them for the second season and I have to say that these tires are one big failure. As long as there is no snow it is ok but a bit of snow is enough and we already have problems with starting and most importantly with braking - in typical winter conditions (snow on the roads) driving at a speed of more than 50 km / h is suicidal. The car on the snow is over / under control and we don't really know when it will throw us and in which direction. Those who appreciate the comfort of driving on these tires will not know it. . . That is why I strongly advise against buying these tires, for example Debica or Kormoran are much better and the price is similar. . ."
5665,"The doctor is clearly profit-driven, a short visit without an interview with the patient, no discussion of the possible causes of the disease, the easiest way of treatment - the use of the strongest drug on the market (Izotek), which can cure but it wreaks havoc in the body. And this is how anyone can cure. When she refused this form of treatment, the doctor wrote down an antibiotic (also very common), which told me that she used to use m once, but after finishing the treatment everything came back. The doctor's answer is ""at some point it must finally help"". So the doctor's approach is after the corpse, after all, this chemistry must help. The liver will sit down at the most. Doctor, not very talkative, dry, probably she spent too much time in this office (almost 20 minutes!), because other patients were already killing each other. No opening to other forms of treatment, smells of signed agreements with pharmaceutical companies. I do not recommend . Most of the lower speakers give a good grade, but as she noticed, not yet knowing the effect of the treatment, so I guess these are too hasty grades. I encourage you to be careful, quickly and efficiently does not mean professionally and competently. I personally do not recommend."

5670,"It seems to me that most of the negative opinions are now out of date. The hotel has changed ownership and has been renovated for the current season. It is beautiful, intimate and nice. It seems that some of the rooms have to be climbed uphill, but such charm of the local nature. It is also true that there is no animation. Well... . ...you have to be creative. But you can't complain about the dirt, neglect and lack of competence of the staff, everything is great. A very nice stay on a beautiful island in a quiet area. It's worth renting a car, scooter and drive around recommended places."
5671,"actually, it's a nice hotel located in the heart of Brno, great breakfast, nice service, WiFi in the room - great potential, climate, people. . . BUT. . . . ! ! ! ! However, the downsides are too important for me to be a guest of this hotel again : 1 . It is very difficult to hit, you need to know that you should enter the ""pedestrian zone"" to see the signboard of the hotel - big minus2 . PARKING - none ! ! ! and you have to pay 15 Euros, leave the keys, the car is escorted somewhere. . . 3 . Receiving the car - in my case, complete hopelessness - the car was to be placed at a certain time, it turned out that you have to go somewhere to look for it with buckles, without the help of staff - with the information that the car stands somewhere there with the keys inside! ! ! - The car wasn't there because you were late and I was flying 'em with my child and luggage like an idiot looking for a car. It all ended well, but it wasn't a nice ending to my visit to this hotel. 4 . SPANIE - beds / mattresses uncomfortable, worst of all, however, pillows - flat as cakes - should not be such pillows in any hotel! ! Sleep comfort in connection with this - bad."
5673,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with A . B . - The Doctor doesn't seem to be a very competent doctor (unfortunately, like most doctors from Lux Med Mehoffer) . Her way of speaking and annoying is not very pleasant during the visit . What is 3 days L4 - she explained to me that exposing L4 for more than 3 days is connected with explaining herself to the head of the facility and that she does not want to. It's better to go for 3 days and if it doesn't improve, then for 3 days again. . . . There's nothing like driving yourself during illness. ""Best"" however, the Doctor impressed me on my first visit. There's a light above the office door. ""Please don't come in."" When the patient came out in front of me, the lamp was lit, so I sat politely and waited for it to go out (it was already about 10-15 minutes after the agreed time). After about 5 minutes, the heiress went out, called up my name and said: ""So what, you have to invite me to come in? ! "" . . ."
5674,"The object without any major reservations, we got a nice and spacious room, which we can not say about the others, rather of raw and average species, nothing to do with the four-star object. The SPA area is a small swimming pool, steam sauna, dry sauna, caldarium, jacuzzi, including one outside. And as for the services - not wanting to hurt the restaurant staff, it should be written, the lady serving us was unpleasant, and serving soup just spilled it on a saucer! The massage is more like a missize than a real massage, manicure done carelessly, nails look like with a three-day regrowth, the manicurist even poured polish on the plate, did not rub the brush, and the whole thing lasted 1, 5 hours, cost 130zl! If it wasn't for the voucher received as a gift, we would have had ourselves an inner clash spending nearly 1000zl for one night with massages and a completely unsuccessful manicure. The price does not reflect the value . On the plus side - food in the restaurant tasty and nicely served ! For owners to think about the issue of training for employees, both skills and approach to the customer."
5675,"A professional and nice consultation where she felt that someone is approaching me individually and with great commitment. The stress before the first visit was already gone after the first minutes from entering the office. The proposed diet plan turned out to be easy to implement, because it does not involve any catorch, takes into account seasonal products and my taste preferences. Actually, I'm just starting to fight against excessive kilograms, but I feel I'm well cared for because I'm very satisfied with the commitment and approach of your dietitian. I recommend the knowledge and motivating approach."
5676,"Girls may be and is a good gin, but unfortunately they don't respect their patients. She hasn't come to the clinic several times already, despite the patients' appointments, the girls were dismissed from work, they were driving from the other end of Wawa, a friend even took a vacation for the day because she had a deadline during the day and the doctor didn't show up. That's probably a slight exaggeration. The medication we take is not aspirin, you have to take it under control, and making an appointment for the next one on a regular close date with this doctor is not possible."
5677,"The doctor may be a great gynaecologist, but if I gave birth under her care my long-awaited baby would be born dead because she waited for the progress of the birth 10 hours after the green waters left, the baby lost two times its heart rate and was born with MAS syndrome, Meconium chloride syndrome, the baby had to be intubated and breathed behind her ventilator and not to mention what she had to suffer during treatment."
5678,"Starting from the beginning, it was the reception desk that made a problem with the check-in and still seemed to be in discussion. After a half an hour of fighting for the room, it turned out that the room was not ventilated, the TV remote control is not working and the air conditioning is not working either. Asking the reception for an extra towel in order not to flood the whole room, she received an info that she should be 5zl. . . Well... . She passed away that sadness as you so can not take care of the guest and the hotel. After 2 days of reporting faults and forcing a meeting with the manager, she managed to get another room. . . It is full of joy that although here the air conditioning works, the enthusiasm fell with the switching on of the TV which no longer worked. After another intervention at the reception came the snouting of the chloptas in the cables and the TV if it didn't work so it doesn't work. No more Ibis Hotel ! ! ! ! I am embarrassed by the staff and what is left in my room. I think the owner should take a ride in his hotels. In this hotel everyone is to be released."
5679,"For a visit to Dr. Łazęcki I went privately to the endocrinology clinic Convictor in Pruszków in order to do an ultrasound of the neck / thyroid, because for some time now I had a visible thickening (a ball protruding from the neck). Most of the visit was devoted to completing my personal data in the computer (it was my first visit) and an interview (whether I smoke, drink, family diseases, etc.). The ultrasound itself lasted maybe two minutes. The doctor actually limited himself to looking at, or rather taking a record/photograph of the thickening, then said that it was a 3 cm thyroid tumor and that a biopsy would be needed to determine its character. Unfortunately, the ultrasound taken by the doctor was very fast, very superficial and so imprecise that it did not show a second quite large tumour (1 cm) or two smaller nodules within the same thyroid lobe! I found out about their presence after another ultrasound, which this time was performed by the best thyroid ultrasound specialist in Warsaw. For the visit to Dr . Łazęcki paid m 200 PLN (in W - he knows 140 PLN), she did not get a description of the ultrasound from him, he was supposed to prepare it only for the next day, in fact the description was ready only after 4 days - she called me every day and found out if it was there, because nobody was kind enough to inform me. The news of the tumor knocked me off my feet, so I don't wish anyone so long to wait for the result, especially since it was a private visit. Now I am one year after the thyroid surgery, after the biopsy I was suspected of having bifocal papillary carcinoma, hence the important news from the ultrasound about two tumors. I was lucky enough - postoperative histopathology showed a benign tumor. I do not recommend Dr. Łazęcki."
5681,"The smell is terribly heavy and for rude Russian women who like heavy spirits. . . I recommend it for the winter evening. Unfortunately, some ladies use summer and daytime in addition. . . Who wants to poison their rivals with the scent so that their heads ache and get pressure beats to the head I recommend! . They like the smell of a real moss. For those with more delicate taste and women on the level I do not recommend ! Scent for simple women at the checkout which they like to show the abundance of a rich partner's wallet and necessarily a beautiful bottle . Bottle and a beautiful elephant ; )"
5683,"Very comfortable beds, clean rooms and professional service. Very good breakfast with a large selection of products (menu). In the hotel, 24-hour fitness. The rooms have an ironing board, an iron and a hair dryer in the bathroom. In addition, fast and free internet (wifi). Location is a great advantage. The hotel in the very centre of the city. 2 steps from the station. With 3 * hotels, this one seems to me to be the best one in which I lived (the quality of accommodation must also be assessed in terms of price and number of stars). Reception desk on the first floor: if someone can't hit and it bothers them, let them stay at home. He didn't notice 'em either cold water or low pressure ( we lived quite high up )"
5684,"Dr. Grzesiowski assessed that differences in access to new vaccinations will affect the health of our society. It is known for example . It is known, for example, that vaccinating all infants against pneumococci after just two years brings about a 50-percent decrease in the incidence of serious diseases caused by these bacteria - pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis. Such are, among others, the experiences of Kielce, which during 4 years of financing pneumococcal vaccinations in infants observed a halving of the incidence of pneumonia in children under 5 years of age. The related savings were calculated at PLN 1 million. Additionally, after 3-4 years of vaccinating all infants, the so-called population effect, i.e. decrease in the incidence of pneumonia among adults who communicate with toddlers, is becoming visible - explained Grzesiowski in an interview with PAP. It is mainly seniors who - apart from children under 5 years of age - are also more exposed to pneumonia caused by pneumococci."
5686,"The turn of the year usually brings many personal changes. It is no different in 2012. Here are just some of them. At the beginning of January, the new president of B & B Hotels Poland Sp . z o. o. became Mrs. Beatrice Bouchet . Mrs. Beatrice knows the Polish market (also Polish) because she worked in our country for several years in the Louvre Hotels Group. After returning to France she worked in the headquarters of B & B Hotels . Krzysztof Potocki, the previous president, remains in the B & B Hotels chain as a board advisor. Beatrice Bouchet (formerly Gardon), graduated from the College of Commerce in Bordeaux. She started her professional career as Head of International Studies at Ubifrance (French Centre for Foreign Trade) . She then moved to Poland and started working for the Louvre Hotels Group, where she was responsible for the development of the chain. She continued her career in the building market management company Castorama, where she was responsible for business analysis. While living in Poland she got to know the domestic market and learned to speak Polish fluently."
5687,"Lack of competence and extremely disrespectful approach to the patient . In the case of an inflammation of the ear (manifested by pain, crackling, noise, etc.) the ""doctor"" said that everything is in the best possible order because there are no changes such as purulent leakage, hearing loss, etc. Apparently, this would have to happen in order to cause any reaction from her. i.e. prescribing any inflammatory medicine, etc. The problem with the ear has been getting worse every day, a few days later in another drug of the same specialization, it turned out that ear inflammation is already so serious that it ended up being not only a local but also a general antibiotic. I definitely do not recommend it."
5688,"According to her, the rice quinoa is a very large dose of protein, which is very similar to animal protein. Products from it are recommended, for example, for people on a plant diet or for athletes. ""When it comes to amaranth, which is actually a pseudo-God, its seeds contain a huge dose of iron. It will be a very valuable product in the diet of anaemic patients, pregnant women, the elderly, and all those who need a higher dose of iron,"" stresses the nutritionist. In addition, these cereals are very rich in flavonoids, which are substances that have antioxidant properties. ""They sweep free radicals out of our body, so they help to automatically protect us from cancer, delay the aging process, increase our immunity,"" - adds Ataniel. The old varieties of wheat are also coming back to their favour: flattening, self-propelled, and spelt."
5689,"The biggest advantage is the location in relation to my destination. Unfortunately, the disadvantage is that there were roof windows in the room, in which there was no control of closing during the rain and thus there were damp patches on the walls, not to mention the state of the panels on the floor. . . Aesthetics in relation to price unfortunately not satisfactory ."
5690,"Like compressed air - an ideal product with no differences to be specified for comparison; like washing powder or toothpaste. It's a product from the lowest price range, I would like to say: why overpay. Unfortunately, I bought 'em some cans. The air in the can was of course, but it came out of the can with far less energy than the air of a competing brand, of course, also from the cheapest shelf, which I've used 'em so far, so that it wasn't, I won't give it. After changing the nozzle on the can also. It may be intentional, or even probably it is the compression force that the manufacturer considered the most suitable for computer hardware and photo cleaning. Competitive cans had a higher compression force and were designed for the same application. For me, a bit of a disappointment - I professionally repair in it I clean machine gardening equipment and the can unfortunately did not manage. I ran out of another can, everything was great. He took 'em Vakossa, a few different cans, because he bought 'em a lot, and nothing. The cigarettes won't move. For cleaning the keyboards, it's good for you, the keys don't tear. If anyone reads it at all, I hope it will brighten the atmosphere."
5691,"Hello. To Dr. . Volynka walked me privately during my pregnancy. He was nice, he explained everything, he took an ultrasound. In the 7 msc of pregnancy I was taken to the hospital for maintenance because I was threatened with premature birth. When she was leaving I decided that I would now go to the clinic because every 2 weeks I would spend 80 zloty for an appointment + maintenance medication, it was too much money for me. And then Mr. Dr. Dr. became spraying, answering questions ""stupidly"" and rudely. When she asked me for something and heard my answer she preferred not to ask me anything anymore. During the last ultrasound he said that the baby weighed 3300 g and gave birth to a baby that weighed 2800 g. I wouldn't recommend it unless you ladies walk in private."
5692,"Encouraged b . positive opinions I booked a three-day stay . Since the rooms are different in design, I have arranged by phone which room we will get. On the spot it turned out that there was a mistake and we were placed in a room called a Venetian chamber. Despite the lowered standard it is the same price as the other double rooms. As for the decor I do not say anything, because it is a thing of taste (definitely not my climate), but the room was dark, overwhelming, had old furniture and carpet that emitted an unpleasant smell, the windows were dirty, the sheet was dirty, and in the bathroom a broken cistern. The whole thing was complemented by a large cathode ray tube TV, which as it turned out did not work (loud buzzing made watching impossible). Thanks to the courtesy of the staff, the husband watched the match in the room, which was originally reserved for m and which was free. I made the above reservations on my departure. As far as breakfasts are concerned, it's okay, however, on the second day the bread was stale. To sum up, the price of the room was completely inadequate to the standard. I am dissatisfied with my stay and do not recommend it."
5693,"Unfortunately, he ripped off the medial and anterior cruciate ligaments of the so-called . . . ACL . Visit to SOR, as usual, x-ray, no fracture, and classically, regardless of the result, they pack into plasterboard rails (I do not know what reasons direct such actions). I went for a consultation and ultrasound examination. Unfortunately, such an examination in the case of a knee can be ineffective, but in combination with manual tests such as PivotShift or DialTest it already gives a better image, especially in hands that know how to do it. Unfortunately, the diagnosis was not optimistic. To make sure I got 'em a referral for an MRI and again I went with the result. By the way, he once again chose em ULTRAMEDICA as recommended especially for people active in sports. Unfortunately, the doctor's assumptions were confirmed and it was necessary to undergo the procedure . Damage to both meniscus and both ligaments . Today I am 6 weeks after the procedure, which was not without complications, not because of the fault of the doctor or staff, but rather because of the ""fault"" of my body, which likes to play tricks: ) . I won't say that I didn't put any effort into recovering because I would have lied but if I hadn't done a good job during the treatment / surgery I wouldn't have the fitness I have. 95% of the range of joint mobility under full load, there is practically no swelling, inflammation also, invisible scars, muscles at a very decent level. I am just after the check-up visit and the doctor has already ordered to relax because it is great. Now 6 weeks of careful exercise, then 3-6 months of muscle strengthening and slowly you can go back to the sport. I strongly recommend your doctor. It's a pity that not everyone is such a specialist."
5694,"Nice location on a hill, partial (in front of the hotel is another hotel) view of the sea and the Golden Sands (some stairs to the beach down and up, but it's good for your health in option ALL) nice and clean rooms. Nice and clean pool . Very good food and service. Beach service paid as in all Bulgaria . Bilsko train stop to the Golden Sands Centre (approx. 15 min.) on the promenade. Every evening performances of local bands and animators . Not far to the left ( 10 min walk ) a small harbour and amphitheatre with performances of local bands and other attractions for Golden Sands . Very decent hotel worth its price . Near Varna ( 20 min . taxi or bus ) . Taxi and bus stop in front of the hotel . From the optional tours I recommend a boat cruise and a tour of Nesseber. I highly recommend ."
5695,"She was looking for my help and she wanted to pay for it. And then what do we get, dear patients? 20 minutes of conversation - a lecture on how different it can be with an allergy, a leaflet and standard drugs that have been giving nothing for years. Any tests, referrals, tests, skin lesions, attempts to find different solutions? From where ! NOTHING. She did not even test me. A prepaid visit ends quickly because the queue. . It ends in nothing, because other, less standard treatment requires more commitment. Confused and suffering (we are looking for help after all) the patient goes out and does not know what to do next. What to do if the doctor does not treat you. I came out with severe dyspnea and wounds on my hands. And I will not go back there again."
5696,"I was a little laughing when I read 1 - lice opinion, because it is very similar to mine, because my husband and I also moved to the clinic where he currently works. Sometimes even my husband and I laugh that Mr. Doctor will think that we are persecuting him: - ) finally it's already 3 changed clinic. As you can see, this is the best proof that his medical knowledge and intuition is on a high level. He always devotes as much time to the patient as he deserves and answers the questions in detail. He prescribes drugs very accurately and conducts the whole treatment. Doctor with heart and by vocation."
5697,"Encouraged by positive opinions, she went to see me but the Doctor misdiagnosed me. After a quick look at the growth she assumed that it was HPV and that I had to get infected from someone. She explained to me that there is no option for me to get infected because I have one partner. So the Doctor said that she could have gotten it from him - letting me know that maybe he has more partners. She burned me out of shame and after receiving a prescription, she left my office. The Doctor saved me a Condyline - a strong agent that should burn this growth. After 3 days of use, the medicine did more harm than good, causing severe burns, bleeding, etc. Worried, she went to see a venereologist/ dermatologist for a consultation. Despite the damage the drug did, the venereologist found that this growth is simply my nature and there is nothing to worry about. He said it's not 100% HPV - especially since the year before I had a full set of tests in an oncology hospital. He also said that if the plant was actually a condyloma it would fall off or at least dry out and not burn the skin after taking the medicine. Unfortunately I do not recommend this specialist."
5698,"The hotel definitely deserves 5 * . Service, location, rooms, cleanliness, price. Kitchen, daily something new, different, I think everyone will find something for themselves. A huge plus for the location, from the hotel (50m) there is a bus leaving, which for little money can get to the center of Belek, Side, Serik or Antalya."
5700,A very nice hotel. Family atmosphere . We were in Klimek in January during the holidays. Very nice staff. The ladies at the reception always advised where to go or what is the schedule for the children on a given day. The slope in Wierchomla is about 10 minutes by car. There are no kettles in the room but you can always ask for hot water in the thermos. I recommend the swimming pool where there is a lifeguard and a super pipe for kids to slide down. It is also worth to use the spa (prices are quite normal). In the bar there are bowling but more for those who want to relax or for children. There is also billiards. You have to make a reservation for both games. The food was good to eat. I recommend this hotel for holidays in the mountains.
5701,"I don't understand so many positive opinions. Do people from the vicinity of Dr. Barcikowski speak here? Because I can't believe there are so many of his ""fans"". I've been going to Dr. Barcikowski's for over a year. My bad opinion about this doctor started when he gave me a vaginal ultrasound without securing the device with a condom. It was a nightmare. I was worried for days and days and I wasn't even HIV positive. A few days after the visit I got acute inflammation and had to be treated with oral medication. Maybe it was just a coincidence - I don't know. She should have seen me doing the test, brought him back to me, but I didn't have the courage. After I left the office, I had a huge grudge against myself, but, well. . . A Pole wise after the injury. He's not at all comfortable at seeing this doctor. He's kind of weird, locked in, not sharing his knowledge. . . . .almost says nothing, only I have to ask."
5702,"The day was supposed to start at an hour. At 16, the keys after the brawl and the ""big"" cleaning of the second floor were given to us by the whole staff including Mrs. Menager at 20; 30 after many corrections and cleaning again. In the rooms the floor simply stuck to the shoes, in the bathroom on the walls under the shower a nice mushroom, in the canteen on the walls beautifully grown mushrooms, no clean dishes, the staff who cleaned, made meals and was in the canteen; resigned from work on the first day of the holiday, then there were people from the ""roundup"". I have ""nice"" pictures to look at."
5703,"We liked the offer of Folwark Łękuk very much, so when we suddenly decided to go to Masuria and there were no more places in Łękuk, we took our tent with us to spend 2 or 3 nights in Łękuk. We were with two children, it was to be their first stay under the tent, so we were looking forward to it. We liked the place in general, well maintained, a lot of greenery, a camping site under large trees, sanitary facilities very clean, only the lake overgrown quite outside the places designated for splashing by the shore, so if someone is swimming, it is rather poor. We wanted to buy food, but it turned out that we do not know what about dinner on the day of arrival, we have to wait, then maybe something will stay? : / barbecue not know if you can light up, water bike not know if you can take at 9 in the evening, generally nothing is known, only one lady really competent, everything always knew: ) somehow it discouraged us all, to this all-day noise coming from the construction of a new facility and a group of appendages drinking beer on the lake bridge in the evening, throwing loudly indifferent comments, vulgar vocabulary, despite the presence of small children. We spent only one night there and left in the morning, eating only breakfast, not great anyway. I do not know what kind of goat's cheese and other fricasas you write about in the commentary below, maybe they had bad luck, because we did not find anything like that, ordinary food, cold meat good, although calling water with syrup from the bottle ""juice"" is a bit exaggerated. Apart from the fact that for coffee you have to pay extra 6 zloty, it is written on the coffee machine that only the staff serves coffee, the staff asked answers that they do not know: ) Well, well, that nice gentleman ( dude ) helped. Oh, wi - fi is paid 5zł per day, we were leaving at 9am, but we were counted 2 nights, and how: D Trampoline (not the youngest one, by the way) for children also paid, unless you are in a package: ) Generally, we did not like it."
5704,"The hotel has long been a great hotel, with ruined carpets, old furniture and a soft bed. Terrible service as in the People's Republic of Poland, the smell of chlorine from the swimming pool throughout the hotel, not too clean, only the location OK close to the beach although a piece from the promenade and bars! The hotel is not worth the price, the pool is dirty, no soap in the shower, the state of cleanliness of the mirrors in the pool is tragic and disgusting. The SPA is a good solution because it is separated from the hotel and operates on its own account. I would definitely advise against it for this money."
5705,"The hotel is located near the famous castle in Malbork, so you can go there for a short walk. The room was a bit old and dark, but you can see part of the history of the castle. The small TV had a limited number of channels and the reception was not the best (a lot of snow). My room was located next to the old lift, so it is better to ask for a room located away from that noisy machine. It was said that WiFi internet might not be available or not work, but that's old news. It had a good WiFi connection, although the speed of such a thing itself, but enough to check emails and find information etc. The service at the reception was friendly. The girl who helped me with the check-in, spoke fluent English and helped me check the train schedules for Gdansk. Well done. Breakfast was on the table, but not very good. The bread was not fresh, and without asking, I was served a plate of scrambled eggs. The worst part is that the place where you sit depends on the room number. The room number is on the table. I was sitting at the table with some strange Polish guy (who probably hasn't washed for a month) who, like most Poles, didn't speak English. When she reported her dissatisfaction to the staff, they said that they had made a mistake. Such a hotel should not make such mistakes. The next day, because I slept there for two nights, I was again seated at a table for two. Unheard of. Only this time the other person was not at the table, so let it be. This time they asked what kind of eggs I want. To sum it up: this is a hotel that could be in the lead, in the best location, but it is not. I'll bet if the Hilton finds out about it, and finds it worth it, this hotel will be turned into a 5-star."
5706,"All right , Mr. Dr. nice and friendly but unfortunately she left the office with what she already knew m and about what I told dr . She was convinced that I was going to have my breasts done, at least, and here's just a confirmation that there is a lump where I can feel it. She left me confused and angry at myself that for 10 minutes of chitchat she paid m 150 PLN."
5707,"I was taken to this five-star hotel by city bus straight from the airport. The access to the hotel itself surprised me a little because the pavement was in a tragic condition and I had to go ok. 300 meters, a stationary street, which is the internal route of the hotel. The building itself, inside, shone with cleanliness, both in the room and in the public areas. From the restaurant, the entrance leads straight to the magnificent garden, where you can relax or take a walk. I only regret that I ordered a room on the top floor. In the middle, in an upright position, you can only move to the middle of the room, as the top floor is an attic with a sloping roof and a window in the same roof, from which the only view was of the sky and the tips of the trees. When this window was opened, needles were spilling inside. It's a pity that the hotel didn't warn me that the top floor looked like this. The bathroom in the room was clean and modern. The hotel staff, from porters, through receptionists, to cleaners, is a model of elegance, tact and professionalism. Although there was 'em without a car, they saw 'em in the hotel's secure parking lot with a security guard. The only downside was a stereotypical breakfast, common as in most bars. But the overall impression was excellent."
5708,"Yasuhiro Yamauchi from a team of a Polish scientist performed artificial insemination on the germ cells of mice. It consisted in the fact that not yet fully mature sperm, so called spermatids, was injected into the egg cell (this is the so-called ROSI method). In this way an embryo was obtained, which was then introduced into the body of the female rodent, who gave birth to the offspring. It is not yet known how safe this technique is in humans. In the future, however, it gives hope for the offspring to live to see the offspring also for the males, who cannot be helped today. Prof . Monika A . Ward claims that the minimum content of the Y chromosome is sufficient for artificial insemination, if only two genes - Sry and Eif2s3y ."
5709,"Definitely a great hotel! The roof terrace is unrivalled, especially as the DJ plays music in the background! Then the atmosphere becomes very pleasant. Mojito is great, the moet is served at the right temperature according to the rule with lime etc. In the lower restaurant very good squids, pizzas are also recommended! At the top you have to do something with the boards, huge splinters are stuck in the feet - although the lifeguard by the pool at the top is very helpful, brought a needle, first aid kit and oxidized water, which does not change the fact that without the flip-flops you can not give even a step. Coffee very good. We recommend aqua gym run by Matthew - great guy and amazing energy! Definitely the hotel deserves its stars. Very pleasant SPA, part of the sauna divided for those without outfits and dressed up, which is a huge advantage!"
5710,"I gotta go to Dr. Wildfi with another disease. He treated me for my thyroid. I will never recommend him to anyone in my life! not only were the visits after 5 minutes, but after a few months my eye started to swell. Of course, she reported me to the doctor immediately because it happened after 2 days of taking another medicine. The doctor said that sometimes it happens but there is nothing to worry about. He calmed me down and prescribed another medication. After half a year of flying around the different doctors thinking that it wasn't the thyroid that got me to the hospital in Lublin for an MRI and steroids. It turned out that it was due to a fatal match of drugs. At the moment, my eyesight is terribly deteriorated and my eyelid is significantly raised and has not returned to normal. . . . I'm depressed by this fact. Think about whether you want to choose this doctor. . . . The massacre... . ."
5711,"I strongly advise against it! ! ! The guest at the lectures rewrites the script, he cannot solve some tasks from it, he cannot translate. But when he comes to a circle or an exam it is a massacre. The tasks are difficult, but the worst thing is the way he grades. He can always get on with something and give 1 point for a correctly solved assignment. This way he fails about 70%. To sum up: If you want to pass, avoid it like a fire! ! !"
5712,"She chose me an independent room, which turned out to be quite large. The bathroom in the room, either made quite long ago or very cheap. Interestingly furnished rooms, in boho style, a very nice large living room where you can sit down and have a beer. Breakfast is quite poor - toasted bread, cheese and ham."
5713,"Very nice hostess. Many amenities, kitchen, breakfast included in the price. The only downside is that you can't go out on the terrace after 23rd - it's only available for the family room: - ) . A neighborhood typical for Tenerife. Not too high up, access is also not too complicated: -) in general, if you want to spend time in a quiet area on the island - I recommend."
5714,"It's hot on July 14th at 1 p.m. 00 the first guests crossed the threshold of the newly built Lamberton Hotel in Oltarzew near Warsaw (direction Poznan). We informed more about the construction of this hotel in the April issue of ""Hotels"". Nearly 100 people invited to the opening ceremony visited the hotel, got to know the staff, but most of all congratulated the building to the investor and had fun at the inaugural party. Hot and cold buffets were prepared by the hotel kitchen under the supervision of the Chef - Artur Raven. The afternoon and evening were enriched by vocal and instrumental performances of the opera duo, interspersed with dance music. Elegant in style and architecture, the Lamberton Hotel stands on a plot directly next to the A2 Warsaw - Poznan route."
5715,"Located a little out of the way, but we will not be forced through the Conference Center. . . however, the interior design of the rooms and the kitchen give reason for great satisfaction . If you get a room with a balcony. . . .it's already full of luck. The food is also recommended. In a word, there is nothing else to look for. Two remarks: It is better to mark the reception desk and towel hooks closer to the shower."
5716,"We were with a group of 17 people on 3 days. 02 - 6 . 02 As far as the standard is concerned, there is a fireplace in the dining room, average rooms, as in a hostel, . The worst impression is made by the staff - 4 people and the dining room is open from 9 a.m. - you can't have breakfast earlier because the lady who washed the floors 5 minutes after 9 a.m. was outraged that we'll mess her up. Pancakes could be ordered in an hour, that is after 10. Ordering 3 coffees and teas exceeded the possibility of service - teas were not issued. Ordered bonfire - we got a wet tree, we could barely get it lit. In short, arrogance. On the second day a group of 30 people came and threw up the whole hostel - we couldn't even take the shower before we left, before they graciously washed it, we had to leave the hostel - the worst hostel in which we were, and some of them came down"
5717,"The Melia Grand Hermitage is a beautiful and well-kept hotel. The rooms are very beautiful. The pools are clean and neat. The staff is very nice and friendly and if you need any information, they will be happy to help you. When it comes to food, I can not have any objections, everyone will find something for themselves. The fun in this hotel also passes very well. Slides, rope park, etc; they are okay, while the animators are very but very nice, with them you can not get bored, full of fun all day, just all the time something is happening. If you want, you lie down and relax and if you want, you take part in games organized by the animators, whether in the pool or outside it. The animations in the evening are very cool, especially when they are run by animators. Finally, I will write that the animators speak several languages and also speak Polish. There is also a mini club for small children which is run by Polish animators from Tui travel agency."
5719,"Prof. Władysława Mulak Analytical Chemistry I - Itarilde's lecture, before I also subscribe to the very apt characteristics of Professor Mulak. . . . Yes . . . . . It's a great lecturer. . . . : )"
5721,"At the beginning she thought that she found me a super gynaecologist because she was very nice, but with every next visit she was leaving me from this thought. . . She talks a lot about flowers and pansies, but not about details. Leading my pregnancy did not detect the causes of bleeding and pain in the uterus, she said that in pregnancy so sometimes it is and you have to lie down. . . She changed my doctor detected the causes immediately. Lack of knowledge of the paperwork, proving to the doctor that she was wrong, the contact became malicious. I will no longer be able to write more negatives. I wouldn't recommend it."
5722,"I was in both doctor's offices, in Łódź maybe not very comfortable, but in Pabianice without any problems. She took care of my thyroid as well as commissioned the first necessary tests related to the inability to get pregnant and what is interesting not only me but also my husband, which is usually omitted at the beginning. Today we are happy parents without any treatment, but we can certainly not say about her that she was not interested in my case. She was, and yes, you can't say that she was doing something to the eye, without the tests. I completely disagree with such statements. The fact that she returned to her 6 weeks after the birth can prove that she is simply interested in the man and not only the money, why did she return to her? Because the doctor who is leading my pregnancy did not work at all. And the doctor always has, so far. And what is interesting, she met me after many years and remembered my case exactly. . . . .something else can be added. . . . . .for me, PLUS"
5723,"Sleep is possible and conditions are favorable ( stuffy and tight ) . The presence is checked verbally, so you have to be present body and spirit - you cannot put anyone on the list ; - ) . A nice old man, sensitive and has a lot of life knowledge to pass on to the young generation."
5724,"Nice service, subdued inside, good location is one of the advantages of this hotel. For people who appreciate peace, quiet and discretion. What is important without any problems we spent a nice holiday with our two bitches in comfortable conditions at an affordable price. The spa is in black and gold, which helps you to relax and enjoy moments of rest. One big minus is the bar seats, which are very uncomfortable to sit on. All in all it doesn't even sit because the wooden construction makes it impossible to resist."
5725,"The carpet is terribly stained, so are the towels (well, I always have my own, because I wouldn't be able to use them), torn linen, ubiquitous dust, mold and rust at and in the shower. You can also explain to you at reception that you can say something in a nice, polite way without being rude and condescending: ) Three only for breakfasts and service at them. Big choice and nice, helpful service."
5726,"Unfortunately, I can't say anything positive about this doctor. I went to Dr. Niebrzydowski from neurosurgery referral. The doctor is really nice, factual, has a lot of knowledge, but he recommended me two months of treatment with a million pills, which gave nothing. The pain of the fact has passed, but I can bet that it wasn't the pills, because those pills were on completely different. When my family doctor told me what medications I was taking at the vaccination test, he opened his eyes wide with surprise. It seemed like the best doctor - most opinions, positive ones in addition, but I am really disappointed. I will look for another rheumatologist if I still need one."
5727,"She was visiting my family in Poland. My boyfriend and I decided to stay in this hotel this time (supposedly 4 stars * * * * - supposedly), so we counted on good quality, nice room, nice service. I have to say we've been counted. Service - only that was ok and the location (very centre) . The room - small, dark. Behind the cabinet spilled powder - not cleaned, dusty slats. At first we got a room where the joints were black, after she mentioned it at the reception we got another room where they looked better but still not 4 stars. A month earlier we rented a room at Hotel Katowice (3 stars * * *) and a room without comparison better - bigger, more modern equipment. To sum up, the hotel is not a 4-star hotel, maximum 3 stars. Some modernization is necessary,"
5728,"The equipment of the 1st ( lecture ) is generally run quite cool, everything can be understood, only you have to walk. sense of humor rather zero - just the lecture and the end . on the exam questions quite difficult - they check the knowledge in cross-section (6 questions, choose 5) . however, on the amendment gives exactly the same questions . to 1 term I recommend to learn from a set of 97 questions (this list is quite old, but to get in the photocopier and there are questions on the exam) . generally everything is clear and logical - I recommend ."
5729,"After the last visit to the doctor's office, I find that she mainly wants to earn money in a short time. My visit was delayed by an hour because the doctor registered too many patients for one day. What's worse, during the visit she picked up her cell phone a few times and additionally she left the office when she was called by the receptionist. The visit took place in a hurry, she spent about 13 minutes with me. I find that I did not get full answers from the dock to my questions, mainly I prescribed me some herbal medicines which she recommended to buy in a friendly herbal shop. I am disappointed with the visit, which cost me 140 zloty."
5730,"A very nice doctor who listens and translates carefully. She recommends performing tests without incurring additional costs (if, for example, a test is quite expensive, but you do not have to control it so often, she orders it for example once every six months rather than every three months). If you are involved in the case, you can see that you want the best for the patient and at the same time you can see that you know your profession. I've already had three visits, and there is more than one and I'm sure that they will take place at this doctor's place: ) . I definitely recommend it."
5731,"The doctor runs the office to a limited extent. It is easier to get to Dr. Smoleński, a gynecologist - sexologist - about whom I also have a good opinion. I think that the ranking is misleading. Very well known names, like for example the two mentioned, do not care about the Internet ranking. Of course I do not encourage ""creative creativity"" . Fair Olive . . . I recommend the Doctor in matters of sexual psychology, married."
5732,"""However, the shortened treatment scheme has the advantage that it is equally effective, causes fewer direct side effects and is therefore more beneficial and more comfortable for the patient,"" - stressed prof. Wyrwicz . He added that this therapy is also less expensive, which is particularly important in countries where the resources for oncological treatment are limited. Prof . Bujko emphasized that in both therapies it was equally often possible to completely remove the tumor. However, in the previous observations, the overall survival of patients undergoing shortened radiotherapy combined with subsequent chemotherapy was higher by more than 9 percentage points (63.5% in the standard treatment regimen as opposed to 73% in the new treatment regimen)."
5733,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in December. We were there with a trip abroad. In many rooms it was just cold, we had to ask for blankets or extra heaters. The rooms in the hotel were fine, although they were not crazy. Breakfast in total tasty, large, standard choice. The staff tried to do their best, although sometimes they were misleading (it was a form of payment for the stay) and had to repeat two or three times what it was about. The hotel has no parking and the bus had to stand very far away. The advantage is undoubtedly the location in the very centre. I do not know if it deserves 3 stars ."
5734,"Dr. Popko does not stress the students unnecessarily, although he can spoil the mood of very lazy individuals, before the exercise he asks - just a general knowledge of the problem, the report he checks quite carefully, if he has time, he returns a lot. Specific, not exaggerated requirements and a nice atmosphere during classes make me strongly recommend!"
5736,"Potential patients would only point out to me that you should write opinions on the site and not ask questions. The latter is done during therapy. . . I got to Mr. Bartosz ""blindly"" after I liked him. . . Name was put together in a logopedic way, found on the Internet. . . I thought that this psychological method would help me - and it did. A great method, which was very skillfully conducted (a more appropriate word than ""skillfully"" probably does not exist) made me mentally stronger. I am now much more distanced from the world - at the same time, full not only of a sense of humor but also of commitment to such things and activities that I care about. This therapy is certainly intended for people who are able to do a lot but who are unaware of their abilities and who are withdrawn because of depression. ACT teaches how to look at yourself and the psychologist helps to form a ""strong backbone"". I will certainly recommend it."
5737,"Laurent Picheral , will not apply for the position of President of Orbis S .

5738,"I signed up for a visit to Prof. Mędrasia in March, because the research showed a high level of TSH. My impressions - professor conceited, ironically commented on the fact that she did not understand something, how firm in tone she drew my attention to him, it got a bit soft. I have been with him several times and never again - nothing else but the result of TSH I am not interested in, the visit at his place takes less than 5 minutes, a glance at the result of TSH, a printout of the prescription and goodbye, I do not recommend!"
5739,"Nice location, good food, the rest of the hopelessness. Dirty rooms , incompetent service , restaurant service hopeless . Hotel dirty , scratched wallpaper and paint that walls . Carpets ubiquitous, stained and smelly. Under the bed of garbage from the whole season. The pool with dirty, metric water - the temperature did not check m . This hotel is a misunderstanding."
5740,"I don't know if we are talking about the same doctor (once, when I had to deal with him he worked at the New Hospital in Tarnow, pediatric surgery) I am not satisfied with his actions, to this day I have a souvenir of his treatment. I was brought with an open shank fracture. The fracture was nasty, screwed. In the evening when I was brought, he tried to adjust it in a normal way - moving the bone - he failed to do it, the next day he coordinated the surgical folding - he put on a metal plate and five screws. After the surgery, he took off my stitches too early, the wound did not heal. After about a month of walking with the wound alive, he had it lubricated with honeydew honey - after a week of such treatment necrosis appeared, at the last moment the stabilizer was removed and stitches were put back on. Unfortunately, the bones have been badly folded to this day - the tips of the broken tibia overlap, making the calf thicker and the arrow in the ogule was not folded and also grew up on its own. The gypsum was 11 weeks old, it did not walk for 6 months and at the end of the treatment, we and our mother were gracefully referred to the sanatorium. I advise against it!"
5741,"Mrs. Dr. Bystrzanowska is not interested in the patient's problem! She always looks bored and you can see that she does not like her work. It was the first time I met with such an approach to a patient, even in a public clinic I was treated better (and the visit to her was 100 PLN). She's sitting forever staring at her laptop and has only gg open! ! ! ) . A few visits are only a few hundred thrown into the mud. They only helped me in the basketball clinic and there you don't pay anything! So I strongly advise against it - or if someone wants to look at the beautiful doctor for 10 minutes for 100 PLN, it's best: )"
5742,"I recommend it ! This is my first collaboration with any dietitian and it's a great success. Mrs. Joanna has very well chosen the dishes in the menu to my preference. The menu itself is clear and legible, all proportions of ingredients and portions of meals are appropriate, I do not go hungry, I do not eat. Right away at the first meeting Joanna with her professional approach told me about the changes that await me, she patiently answered my every question. As she wrote earlier, it was my first contact with a nutritionist, so I was terrified and stressed, but Joanna turned out to be a very nice and cordial person, they immediately caught a good contact. For now I am at the beginning of the fight for myself, but I hope that further cooperation with Mrs. Joanna will be equally nice and pleasant."
5743,"I'm not recommending it. It's a pity every zloty spent on an overnight stay. Only bedding was clean, but under the sheet, on the mattress, black hair after previous clients. In the room, the stink and dirt. The service was very courteous."
5745,"Course: Analysis 2 Lecture Evaluation: It can be conducted very quickly, the doctor can rewrite whole definitions from the script, consider many types of tasks that can be useful in colloquia. Unfortunately, sometimes it does not keep up with the transcription. Besides, the doctor assigns a big role to the definition, all the tasks on the colloquia begin with ""Wypr o"
5746,"He's been looking for the tower for over a month. The goal was simple - a small tower for the bedroom. The towers quickly fell off for 300 - 400 PLN due to poor sound. I found em on this Pioneer and immediately liked the selective dynamic sound that reached my ears at low volume. I'm listening to black metal and a few of its variations, where selectivity and dynamics really matter. On Pioneer, I heard 'em what I wanted to hear. A strong bottom end, bright middle and selective treble. I was still wondering about PHILIPS MCD712 but the empty rumble of the speakers scared me away. In turn, the PHILIPS MCM3000 scared me away with its price and quality (plastic and everything loose), although the sound was also very interesting. In Pioneer, I like the display - it does not knock on the eyes and is very clear. It could display the clock on standby, but this is not a criterion for choosing a tower. To sum up. If someone is looking for a mini tower for a small room that is dynamic has a good deep pit and a clean top and is selective then you can take it in the dark."
5747,": ) Classes are conducted in a tavern, so you are close to the university. However, don't try to come to the hopper class, mgr Minikowski hates it (which is understandable of course). Classes are not at all stressful, you do not have to stand at the tennis table all the time, if you get tired you can sit down. If you haven't been to a class, you can arrange to have it with another teacher. You must have an excuse from that day. Any absence is a grade down at the end unless you make up for it. At the end it is a short, stress-free exam (no panic). On the exam you have to present a piece of the game, of course, in order not to make it difficult for you, you choose the person you will play with. Of course, everyone passes: mrgreen: M.A. Miniowski is really interested in the group, you can improve your technique. Generally, I recommend it with all my heart: )"
5748,"In Poland until recently, this mainly concerned accommodation and facilities of very poor standard, but with the emergence of more economy hotels, the competition is moving into higher segments of the market. Some guesthouses, some hotels with 1, 2 or 3 stars standard are being replaced. And this process will continue to grow. It is also the place to look for an answer to the question of where the guests will come from, whether budget hotels are being built or planned."
5749,"Valve prostheses are needed for patients suffering from congenital or acquired defects of their own valves. Currently they use mechanical or biological prostheses, but both have some limitations. In the case of mechanical valves it is necessary to apply long-term antithrombotic therapy to the patient. Biological prostheses, on the other hand, based on both human corpse material and animal tissue material, are at risk of liming or inflammatory reactions. Numerous studies and clinical observations show that their durability is on average about 15 years. After this time, many patients need a valve replacement. According to Dr. Wilczek, a valve covered with the recipient's cells can eliminate these limitations. ""This is an example of increasingly personalised medicine,"" he stressed."
5750,"Initially, she was dissatisfied - she was moved to another hotel due to a breakdown. But thanks to that she could also compare objects and now I am sure it was a good choice. She booked my stay in Mercure due to having an accor card and there was a conference next door. She had some concerns after reading some reviews, but it seems to me that they were not entirely justified, especially at such prices. As an apology she received a room of a higher standard, it was renovated, very clean and smelled beautiful. The rooms are not big, but quite comfortable. Really, I had nothing to complain about. The main advantage of the hotel, however, is not comfortable beds or delicious breakfasts, but phenomenal service - it is rare to meet such nice and helpful people."
5751,"Following the great opinions of Internet users and all information about the experience, history and place of work - she made an appointment with my mother. The first impression was really very positive. High personal culture, well conducted interview, analysis of all the research, conversation and the research itself - nothing to reproach. In addition, help with getting access to the holter at the Banacha Hospital. Then another visit after getting the results from the holter. The second visit was also fine and probably everything would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that the prescribed dosage of drugs almost led my mother to collapse. The doctor recommended that under no circumstances should the dosage of medicines be changed (as people are said to regulate their own medications and often this causes problems with both the pressure and the heart). During the treatment, with a pressure of 70 / 42 and a pulse of 48, I called the doctor extremely worried, seeing how my mother feels. The doctor said it would pass, so as not to interrupt the treatment and the pulse could be increased by a small amount of cognac! ! ! ! Unfortunately - the first time I was convinced and almost forced my mother (who does not drink alcohol) to take 20 - 30 ml. In fact, the heart started to beat a little faster. In this way, my mother will remember the words of the doctor about not changing the treatment - she was taking medicines, she felt very bad, almost fainted and it was ok. 2 weeks. Once again, when the parameters on the blood pressure monitor turned out to be even worse, and the feeling was such that she had already properly reconciled herself to the fact that she was going to die - they called another doctor and it turned out that it is necessary to change the dosage, that the prescribed drugs can be given up to 60 years of life and that it can be given very carefully and in small amounts (instead of 3 x 150mg - at the most 1 time ad hoc!!!). We have changed the way of taking the medicines, the one recommended by your doctor - we have completely stopped. Since then, 2 years have passed - mom feels great. Let's never trust the doctors to the end. Every body is different and when you feel like it, you have to decide whether to continue the treatment or change it. The intentions were probably good - only the result can be tragic."
5752,"Members of many cultures have difficulty hearing sounds that are not typical of their native language. The Japanese, for example, have difficulty in distinguishing between ""l"" and ""r"" sounds. Prof . The spirit explains that these sounds do not stimulate diversity in the brains of the Japanese people and therefore they have big problems with learning languages. Such difficulties appear as early as at the age of 10 months, which is why appropriate training must be at such an early stage. ""If a child is rewarded for recognizing the difference between + l + and + r + , there is a good chance that his or her brain will be able to differentiate these sounds in the future. Such a child will have no difficulty in hearing speech correctly and learning e.g. Polish. Imagine that the Chinese start to speak better in English or that in Europe we start to speak Chinese. This can speed up the process of globalization"" - explained the scientist, who hopes that the toys will be quite cheap and easy to spread around the world."
5753,"Course : Laboratory with meters 3 evaluation : I recommend if you have any idea of measurement I don't know how to lecture, but on the laboratory Ms. Irenka turned out to be very cool. I'm after the technical school and I didn't have any problem with passing the lab at 4, 5 . I'm a bit of a bother to one guy who didn't know anything, but if you're aware of the basics, you won't have any problem to pass. I'm not sure if you know that you didn't write anything, but you should prepare yourself for the questions from the ticket when she will check them, because it will be more important than the ticket itself. As far as I am concerned I had a lab 2 with Jagielnicki and honestly I liked the classes with Mrs. Frankiewicz more. Greetings"
5754,"In a 3-star hotel she got a dirty blanket partially covered with a sheet. At the reception desk I was told that there is not a single pillowcase for this blanket or duvet in the whole hotel. Then in the evening it turned out that at my friend's place from the other part of the hotel there was such a pillowcase. Despite this, the receptionist did not want to give me 1 pillowcase even for an extra charge, because she claimed that they have them counted (! ) . Hopeless approach to the customer! Additionally, the declared internet in the room obviously did not work."
5755,"We have heard a lot about this place and if it does not rain you can admire the beauty of the landscapes not only from the window. But we were guests at the wedding of a wonderful couple: ) The suite with a double bed with short quilts in a colour rather different from white, the towels also took up moisture. In the room, and it was cold, the window was open because the previous guest - rather a worm left old socks :) In the bathroom the shower before I started my bath was already clogged, the window in the bathroom didn't close so when a guest from another room slammed the door, we also had a crack. While waiting for the lift on the 6th floor, a wardrobe opened and I could smell the bed linen stored there - like from a damp cellar. When, after 10 minutes of waiting for the lift, the door with a full cleaning trolley opened and the staff of the flat surfaces asked the question ""can I go down with my luggage, she answered: I also waited a long time and pressed the closing button"". In the ""restaurant"" you can not order because the lady from across the eastern border does not understand and warns ""I do not know if the scrambled eggs are on the butter, it will be - of course in the mother tongue, and I know the language: ) he adds then, and the sour soup is salty and dry bread. ""At the wedding the food is a KPINA! French fries and pork chips, lettuce from a sack of poor, broth either salted or unsalted, dry poultry roulade, service of some boy from a nearby village such an underdog! Fortunately, cakes and cakes were brought from a confectionery! At the wedding there was no Proseco, and the wedding and hotel guests the next day were sold Proseco with ""our labels"" The wedding was great because it was people who created the atmosphere and not the hotel that gives much to wish for! This is supposed to be a resort - it's a BLEF! ! ! We do not recommend this facility unless you are SANTANA : ) and if you find out what the world standards are, you can see the prices from outer space."
5756,"I do not recommend it because of ignoring and disrespecting hotel guests. After 10 p.m. the restaurant was in the best birthday party, screams, noises, music and stamping such that the walls were shaking. To draw the owner's attention to the fact that it was already almost 23:00, we heard that the noises should not bother us so much. The cunning and nothing more. I will definitely not come there anymore."
5757,"It is pointed out that for good profitability of hotel catering it is important to treat suppliers, which can be reduced to the motto: 'Treat a supplier as you would like to be treated yourself'. It is also emphasized that excessive rotation of employees does not serve the purpose of running a profitable hotel catering business. HOW TO AVOID EXCESSIVE STAFF TURNOVER? It is not the customer who comes first, but the employee = the employee is your partner - be honest, he will also Rotation is unprofitable = take care of tips and bonuses also for cooks Pay bonuses depending on results, also on food cost The material prepared by GlobCost was presented during X Forum Profit Hotel, which took place in Warsaw in early December."
5758,"In the Castle we spent a week of winter holidays, walking on the surrounding slopes on countless trails accompanied by competitors taking part in the World Championship in nearby Schladming. The castle itself was beautifully restored, as the owner himself tells us at a special presentation and tasting. Great atmosphere and medieval atmosphere. Only people who are afraid of ghosts and have something on their conscience should think of the castle. . . ; ) We highly recommend! ! !"
5759,"She's a professional psychologist. Very committed to her work and listening carefully to the patient. In our case, the patient is my 13-year-old daughter, for whom Mrs. Aleksandra found a suitable therapist in connection with the problem. We are only after 1 visit but my daughter wants to go for another one and this is the best proof that we recommend this psychologist."
5760,"I don't recommend it, she was treating my child at Mrs. Doctor's 2, 5 years, she lost a lot of money for them and almost led my child to asthma, because all this time she was treating without any tests how she changed my doctor, it was a shock to the condition of a child regularly treated, I strongly recommend it."
5761,"The Vienna International Hotelmanagement ( VI ) chain is holding talks on three new hotel projects in Poland. These are management contracts because the chain is not interested in franchising its own brands, such as andel's or angelo, or running facilities under one of the chain brands. Dr. Andreas Karsten, CEO of Vienna International Hotelmanagement AG, when asked about the developments on the Polish market in connection with the economic crisis in Europe on the one hand and Euro 2012 on the other, said to the ""hotel industry"": ""Of course I am aware of the economic situation in Europe and the risks associated with it in the short term. This applies especially to two key markets for us: Poland and the Czech Republic. In Poland, the EURO 2012 championship will of course have a positive impact on the condition of the hospitality industry - however, I am thinking of its long-term impact on changing the image of Poland in the social awareness of Western Europe."
5762,"I'm after my first visit ( before she panicked incredibly much ) . It's a revelation for me. The doctor devotes 100% of his time and attention to the patient . Actually, I did not feel the doctor-patient relationship, she would describe it as very friendly. She did not feel the pressure of time, even though it is always like that because the visit unfortunately does not last for hours. Specialist - great: nice, cheerful, empathic, treats the patient subjectively, nice sense of humor makes the patient not tense. The doctor is very contactable, his approach makes the person with a problem open up to him (I write about myself). The following opinions helped me a lot, I confirm their validity. If someone is looking for help I recommend Doctor Michał. I am not disappointed in him."
5763,"The summer season is a traditional harvest period for all hotels with a holiday and spa program, for holiday and vacation homes and drying time for facilities located in most major cities. In July and August the use of rooms in hotels is usually 5 - 6% higher than the average for the whole year. In the case of facilities such as holiday homes or leisure homes the use of places is higher by 25 - 30 percent. than the annual average. This does not mean that all facilities belonging to the above mentioned categories should arrive equally. The best hotels at the seaside, in the mountains or in the lakeside may record almost 100% occupancy in these months, while others, often located nearby, wonder why this season is so bad? There will always come a time for such a reflection."
5764,"The strange thing is, so many positives above, that I started to wonder if it was just me who found 'em on the felony copy. The printer used in the company requires daily head cleaning. After a night it stops printing legibly. He prints on it about 30 - 50 pages a day and I clean the head every day (unfortunately), so the inks go at an alarming rate. Especially original . It seems that you can buy replacements cheaply, but they are chip-chips and not every one of them works when you load a full new set . The chip in turn reacts to the number of prints, not the capacity of the tank . They are disposable. The battery is not working when you pull out the battery, replace it with a new set, insert 3-4 different chips one by one, etc . Recently, self-resetting chips have come out, but I have not yet tested them because they are not available in Poland and cost over 120 PLN abroad."
5765,"Thanks to Mr. Arthur, I'm not afraid of the dentist anymore! : ) : ) : ) As a very timid creature, afraid of everything: needles, drills, drill sounds, etc . with a mega sore tooth from which the seal fell out, she found her way to the Cabinet in Targówek and sat on the dental chair with the same fear. After the first visit it turned out that the teeth can be treated painlessly and without stress, and the tooth can look as if nothing has ever been done with it! : ) : ) : ) Now I'm treating the rest of my teeth with the Doctor - basically Mr. Arthur is saving them. . . She finally found a dentist who won't hurt my teeth or me. I RECOMMEND IT! : ) : ) : )"
5766,"A very successful stay. We received an apartment close to the reception - a large living room, separate bedroom and a large terrace. The rooms are modest but very clean, cleaned daily. The rooms are a bit poorly equipped, i.e. no glasses, plates, kettle. The beds are comfortable, but the cushions are very hard - they were asked to be replaced with softer ones and were replaced. There is a car park at the hotel, with a canopy that gives shade. The pool is small, but the water is clean and warm. The beds are a little bit small and have been occupied since the morning. For us it is not a problem, because we used to swim in the sea mainly. To Koukounaries beach 1km on foot from the hotel. The beach is wonderful, ideal for children. The minus is certainly breakfast. I was prepared for the monotony of these breakfasts, so I was not disappointed. No less, however, you can eat to the full. You can choose between sausages, hard-boiled eggs, fried mushrooms, beans, honey, jam, rusks, one kind of bun, one kind of sausage, cheese, canned fruit, white cheese, milk, flakes, orange juice, coffee, tea, croissant for dessert. No vegetables. There is a restaurant where you can eat quite decently. We ate mainly in the restaurant Under the Pine Tree, which serves kebabs, gyros and other Greek dishes. It is 400 meters away and you can eat really cheap and good. Gyros with chicken in a drink is 2 , 70 EUR , dishes 8 - 10 EUR , 1L water 1 EUR , beer 3 EUR . There is a bus stop next to the hotel to get to Skiathos. There are several beautiful beaches, such as Mandraki Elias, Agia Eleni, Agistros, 2-4 km away. Banana Beach is a construction site at the moment - so heard 'em and we didn't go there at all. The wifi in the room were weak, even though it was close to the reception."
5767,"I rate the weekly stay in this hotel as good 4 on the school grade scale: ) We got a family room for 5 people (we were in three people), consisting of two rooms (one smaller - without air conditioning and the other - a living room with a mezzanine, where there was air conditioning and very well cooled the whole area of the room. The decoration of the room was standard, without major luxuries. The rooms are not cleaned thoroughly, but for a week's stay it can be. The food in the hotel is very good, a lot of choice, nobody went hungry - on the contrary: ) ) ) on return with your husband, 3 kg more by weight : ( For drinks and alcohol - available only in the pool bar (and reasonably good) in the aqua park and on the beach extra paid. The beach by the hotel is sandy, very narrow, does not impress, although very safe for children, because it is very long shallow. I recommend that you rent a car and explore the most beautiful beaches of Kefalonia on your own - the views are breathtaking - it is really worth seeing Myrtos (wonderful!) In the hotel very good animators, including some from Poland, who did their best to make the stay more pleasant for the tourists and their children. They all did their best ! The general assessment of good - I recommend ."
5768,"I'm disappointed, I came with spots on my back and I didn't get any questions if I'm being swept away, how long I've had it, etc. The lady said that she couldn't tell now and prescribed the fluid for the trachea. . . . 100zl for 5 minutes of sitting and I found out nothing new, I wouldn't recommend it."
5769,"The doctor has a lot of experience and that's why I know he's putting himself in good hands. Unfortunately, our NFZ works in such a way that people's hands fall down. Nevertheless, I recommend the doctor and I hope that I will be able to get a laser disk decompression treatment under the health service from the National Fund, and that this treatment will have a significant impact (reads: improvement) on my health."
5771,"A colour disorder also accompanies spot diseases, because it is in this spot that the highest density of suppositories is found, thanks to which we perceive colour. ""Since this disease primarily impairs visual acuity, patients mainly complain that they can't see well, not that they can see colours badly,"" noted doc . Pojda - Wilczek . The ability to see colours can also be lost as a result of a brain injury, even if the organ of vision is not damaged. ""The matter of color vision begins in the retina, but is actually realized at brain level. It happens on many levels. Even those who do not have daltonism, see the world in different tones, depending on the individual configuration of the photosensitive elements in the retina and the brain's abilities. The differences in colour vision are very beautifully presented by artists. The tones in their paintings change depending on how old they were, whether they had cataracts or retinal diseases - all this changes their perception of colour"" - said the ophthalmologist."
5772,"Since the beginning of Euro 2012 the average price ( ADR ) has increased by more than 55%. Krakow has hosted three teams and fans of these teams in its residential centres. Moreover, its good location in relation to Wroclaw and Warsaw made Krakow a convenient place for fans on their way to Lviv in Ukraine. In Kiev, where STR Global is studying the performance of six hotels in the Luxury and Upper Upscale segments, hoteliers experienced a drop in attendance throughout the tournament, except on the night before the matches."
5773,"""Indication of a doctor as a source of information about a healthy lifestyle and, at the same time, the highest indication in the category: authority shows trust and high credibility of this professional group - comments Ewelina Nazarko - Ludwiczak from Headlines Porter Novelli . - However, she is worried, both in the question about the source and the authority, about such a high result of lack of indication or answer of the type I do not have / do not know - this applies to more than a quarter of respondents. Low indications were given in mass, popular forms of information transfer, such as e.g. leaflets, which indicates fatigue with the amount of such materials. What is worrying is the result that more than half of Poles do not see any changes in their lifestyle in their surroundings. Certainly worthy of note is also the fact that both in the question about the source and the authority, the Internet received the highest ratings among the media"" . PAP - Science in Poland"
5774,"The doctor is very thorough when examining the patient, not only draws attention to the main reason for the visit, but also looks at other parts of the body for the most common skin diseases. She is willing to explain and advise in case of doubts or uncertainties, so I can recommend her to others. Minus - you are very talkative, which results in delaying appointments even by several dozen minutes."
5775,"The hotel is located in the centre of the island's most entertaining village, Laganas, but being there you do not feel close to the centre - it is green and peaceful. The rooms are very nicely furnished. It is a good choice for those looking for comfortable conditions in the center of the resort. Not for families with children - the hotel has nothing for the little ones."
5777,And I'll talk about the Gniezno doctors I met at the hospital. One of the best doctors in Gniezno and experience . Very gentle . Interested in patients . Example was walking me in the hospital holding my belly and he looked at me and asked if something hurts. She hit him twice and he always approaches the patients with the same care and sympathy. My cousin went to him privately and she praised him very much.
5778,"She was at the hotel with my boyfriend. At first sight, a decent hotel. However, the spell has gone to the reception desk approach. We stood there for 1 hour. Okay, they got us a card and we went in. We booked a room with two floors. I have no objections to the decor but the cable was still jammed. Wi - Fi better not to mention. It was just lunchtime. Dinner was tasteless. To my surprise, she discovered that we had found a colony. She was tired of the receptionist not telling us anything. Bowling didn't work because of those brats, of course. Okay, we're going to wellness. Wellnes is a total failure! The pool smelled of chlorine. Even the guy didn't dip because the water was so cold. Sauna is crap! ! ! ! ! The party at 10:00 p.m. was terrible. Only Okocim for 30 PLN! ! She wanted me to wash herself and here the cold water. A nightmare night! You couldn't sleep until 4. 00 in the morning ! We were supposed to be there for 2 weeks. We came back 4 days before that, saying ONE WORD BRUD T - A - N - D - E - T - A"
5779,"At the entrance to the Tatra National Park and 10 minutes to Krupówki . Pension Times of Excellence - MSW is behind. Nowadays, the company, probably former MSW? No matter. Good homemade food, clean, small pool, one sauna, yakuzzi. A few minutes in the White Creek Valley. Free parking, beautiful spruces and running squirrels outside the windows."
5780,"I made an appointment through the portal znlekarz.pl . Everything took place according to the plan, no delay. The doctor gave me 40 minutes ( ! ) - it never happened to me with any other dermatologist. She examined my skin, looked at it carefully. She did a thorough interview, she explained everything. She took into account that for the time being she preferred to avoid using oral retinoids and suggested another treatment, which I hope will be successful. I know it may be different, but regardless of the outcome of the treatment, I will certainly not give up Dr. Dyszyńska's services because, although she has already visited many doctors, she has not yet met me with such a professional approach. To all those undecided I highly recommend this doctor!"
5781,"""I'm trying in my research to answer the question why a man has five fingers and legs. Because it is not obvious at all"" - says professor PAP. Przemko Tylżanowski from the University of Leuven in Belgium and from the Medical University of Lublin . He recalls that e.g. a chicken has four fingers, but there are only three in the wing of this bird. In turn, the horse has only one finger in each leg. ""Today there is no naturally occurring animal on Earth that would have more than five fingers in one limb"" - informs the researcher and points out that it was not always like that - when the animals went ashore ok . 380 million years ago, they had more fingers, e.g. nine or more fingers in one limb. In modern species, however, when there are more than five fingers, there is already talk of a genetic defect - it is called polydactylation. ""If our survival depended on six fingers, I am sure we would have had them long ago and five fingers would have died out. However, apparently the sixth toe does not give an advantage in survival,"" commented the researcher."
5782,"""Today, sugar is such a powerful stimulus for our nervous system that they want us to keep eating it and eating it. So it is worthwhile to do a little experiment: to get rid of simple sugar for a few days - not to drink sweet drinks, not to eat sweets, white bread, to feel the withdrawal syndrome: annoyance, annoyance,"" - says Dr. Szo¿¿. Dr. Magdalena Tomaszewska - Bolałek pointed out that while today we usually like to try out new flavors, such a strategy used to be pointless - it could end in illness or death. ""For our ancestors the bitter taste heralded something poisonous"" - said Dr. Tomaszewska - Bolałek . ""Sweet taste, on the other hand, meant the presence of sugar, which is highly energetic and there was very little sugar in unprocessed food. It was e.g. in ripe fruit. The same is true of alcohol. There is no alcohol in nature, except for overripe, fermented fruit. Man was sensitive to searching for such tastes because they meant energy richness,"" added Dr Pietrzak."
5783,"The hotel has everything you need. The best quality for the money you pay. Nice and clean rooms. Comfortable beds, good breakfast, nice service, free wifi everywhere and most importantly: 5 minutes walk from the market. If I ever come back to Krakow, I will definitely book a room right here!"
5785,"I recommend it to those who appreciate the hotel's swimming pool. In addition to the swimming pool, the hotel offers spa treatments and a gym. The service is really very nice and helpful. The rooms are clean, cleaned daily. The hotel is located on the outskirts of Bastia, but there is a restaurant in the hotel so in case of great laziness, you can eat on site."
5786,"Although I'm not a fan of spending free time in hotels, it's really worth it here. It is worth it because you can feel the spirit of history. The rooms are kept in the castle style, although the corridors are a little gloomy and dark. But this creates a unique atmosphere. The service is nice, breakfasts are overflowing. The pool as for me a little bit small but impressive. The area is full of attractions."
5787,"I was the last patient and the doctor was in a hurry. On a sharp, crumpled pain under the right rib that forced me to go to the hospital at night, and once calling an ambulance at night, when they made it difficult to breathe and no position helped, he prescribed the pills for 4 months that he should pass. . how much can you struggle, not knowing when the attack will be again? not even recommending the services. Which I did anyway afterwards at another doctor and of course the crews came out in a gallbladder. . . . .because I'm defrosting an unusual, acute pain from the typical problems that are prescribed for debridement. . ."
5788,"A specialist who knew what was happening to me at once and I hope that with the help of P . I will return to full life as soon as possible! ; ) The visit lasted as long as it was necessary for me, she was telling me everything that was wrong with me and Mr. Doctor was listening carefully and asking the right questions. . . Then I was given the medicines, the effects of which were precisely explained to me. I recommend a visit to this psychiatrist."
5789,"It's a hotel, but I'll start with the positive things. The hotel service is very nice and professional. Room equipment good . At first we got a studio room in the attic. Very stuffy roof windows from 2m upwards. The bending floor I had the impression that it was holding on the carpet . On a warm day you could not breathe there. After a conversation with the staff, we got our apartment. Very cool with a very exclusive bathroom . And under the window installed air conditioning fans very noisy [ Penalty ] . Sleeping impossible . In addition, the market and opposite the loud pizzeria . And the charm of bitterness poured over Saturday evening in the hotel there is a wedding house where the wedding was and in the restaurant second party closed . In general, the hotel noise two biting music . I do not recommend ."
5790,"For 20 years we have been going on holiday to Greece every year. We are not a demanding tourist. Until now, we have never been disappointed in any hotel. Unfortunately this year, yes. It is not about food or standard in the rooms, but about the treatment of guests with all-inclusive option and specifically about the availability of all kinds of drinks unfortunately not only alcoholic. Soda water is only available in the main hall, although there are three bars in total. Coffee even though it is in nescafe vending machines is certainly not coffee of this company. We are somehow not especially attached to nescafe, but what flies from the vending machine resembles the communist third topping up: ( so called leona . From the Coca Cola dispenser something flows, which turns out to be a seasoned with chemicals and sweeteners brown liquid. I know it sounds a bit pompous and you might think we're overreacting, but for the first time in so many years we've been writing a negative review. The people in the staff are kind of scared and stressed out. We're interested in Greece, we've visited it all over and along, we know a lot of Greeks, but these people here are really weird. After a conversation with one of the bartenders (we know the Greek language), he admitted that there is a monitoring system in the hotel and, for example, he is allowed to pour water only into a small glass and not into a larger one because he is being watched and has already had some unpleasantness because of this. The same applies to beer of course. He felt very embarrassed because of this because, as he said, he thought it was not normal. And when it comes to alcohols in all options: wine, beer, ouzo. Nothing more. But when it comes to food, it is ok . I regret, however, but I do not recommend this hotel . : ("

Katarzyna Jajeczna - shift manager) was very unprofessional, unhelpful - she had a grudge against us for the situation that occurred, I can't help mentioning that she also yelled at her co-workers - we are very disgusted with the situation that arose, but most of all we are very sorry that our colleague had such a bad experience after his first visit to Poland."

She explains the various stages of treatment and the effects of drugs in a way that makes it possible to understand and thus demonstrate her knowledge and competence. If I have any doubts, he always tries to explain even how to ask a second time. This is what I wanted very much while searching for a good rheumatologist. She is very nice and friendly. She remembers her patients, the conversation / interview is conducted naturally. She creates a very good atmosphere in the office. I like to see Dr. Dyś very much. Greetings and recommend ."
5795,"A rusty and neglected facility in which the SPA is overrated due to its small size and not suitable for conditions and occupancy. The food was not even suitable for animal consumption. Taste-free, dried out and embarrassing in general. The room was ok, clean but cold and despite the fact that we ordered a King Size bed, we got a splitting compilation of two single beds and the mattresses were just old and uncomfortable. I do not recommend it! ! ! !"
5796,"The hotel, located on the outskirts of Jastrzębia, near the lighthouse in Rozewie, as someone likes to run is where: ) There are two children's playrooms in the hotel, a small one on the ground floor, a bigger one on - 1, the lack of lift makes it difficult to get to the hotel with a pram. Still, there is what to do with children. The food is very delicious, you can get sick of lack of cold drinks for dinner, you have to order extra and pay. There are children's chairs available in the restaurant but with a large crowd of guests you may run out of them and have to wait. In the rooms on the east side of the restaurant you can get a lighthouse light in the evenings: P A kettle and a baby bath are available at the reception. Generally conditions are ok, although it would be useful to refresh this place a little. The hotel quite often organizes corporate events or rallies so it can be loud, but the staff can handle it: )"

I regret that she didn't look at me here before, but at least my opinion will be a warning to the others.

Exactly yes - the hotel has only a good website . . I don't know where did such a price for a night come from, totally inadequate to the conditions prevailing there. The offer of accommodation has nothing to do with photos and visualization of rooms. Menu - who on Friday serves minced meat and dumplings with meat; seriously? For almost 500 PLN we counted on a good fish. We are not picky and this is not just our opinion - we had the opportunity to talk to several couples and their reviews are identical - the offer for accommodation should be one zero lower. . We made the reservation much earlier - directly through the hotel (not by any groupon or external companies). The sauna was also available only one (although as you can see in one of the answers below - the hotel claims that it is run one because of the conditions and organization by an external company - there was no additional 'event organizer' - and the conditions as you can see remained the same) . Water in the pool - maybe it had 20 degrees; tiny Jacuzzi - barely 3 people entered; changing rooms in the ""SPA"" - one key to one locker, one changing room with a curtain hanging from the top - eh, excuse me, where are the 4 stars? I also agree with the predecessors - either the food is not fresh or they should change their supplier. The place and the square around the hotel - yes yes, the one they mention as a ""park"" is completely neglected, so you couldn't count on a romantic walk. . The only advantage of the whole trip was probably a tour of the castle and I'll end up here, because I'm wasting my time and energy. In a word - I do NOT recommend it!"
5799,"Hotelik , motelux , OTEL , WOTEL Legal protection is provided by names such as hotel , motel , guesthouse . Any other name may be an attempt to bypass the law - UOKiK practice shows that entrepreneurs use diminutives, lux suffixes, incomplete names when their facilities do not meet the requirements specified in the regulations (e.g. sanitary or fire safety) and do not have the appropriate permission of the voivodship marshal. In order to attract customers, they consciously transform the names, offering accommodation according to any standard. Complaint If a room in an agritourism farm actually differs from the one ordered and the hotel is located further away from the sea than the one provided by an employee, they have the right to complain . If a consumer booked an overnight stay in a hotel facility on their own and is not satisfied with the service, they may assert their rights under the Civil Code. He should report the irregularities to the owner of the facility as soon as possible and set a deadline for repairing the fault, replacing the equipment or changing the room. If the entrepreneur does not remove the defect within the time limit set by us or it is not possible for other reasons - we have the right to demand a reduction in the price, and eventually withdraw from the contract and demand a refund of the amount paid. The withdrawal from the contract is possible if the defect is significant."
5800,"It is about the total intake of salt, and not just about the salt we add to the food ourselves (in the form of salting or salting). It should be remembered that salt in quite large quantities is contained in finished food. According to WHO data, processed food products are a source of 40 - 80% of salt in the daily diet of individual countries. It is worth paying more attention to the salt content in various food products. For example, in 100 g of feta-type cheese there is as much as 2 , 75 g of salt and in 100 g of marinated herring there is 2 , 73 g . A lot of salt is also contained in cold cuts. Country ham has 2,57 g of salt in 100 g . Even 100 g of ketchup contains 2.4 g of salt. Bread on average contains about 1 g of salt in 100 g ."
5801,"When the patent rights expire, other manufacturers may start producing the same product - then it is called a generic medicine. When a generic appears on the market, its price drops dramatically (sometimes even by 90%). The generic manufacturer no longer has to pay for costly clinical trials. All you have to do is to replace it with a replacement. The cost of its production is a small fraction of the price required by the manufacturer of the original drug - explained Grieb . ""Generics reduce the cost of treating one disease and the money saved can be used to treat other diseases with expensive innovative medicines. On a European Union scale the savings associated with generics are estimated at 35 billion dollars"" - said prof .

5802,"In the hotel, the staff takes every opportunity to charge the guest with additional costs (e.g. for alleged damage to air-conditioning, or for exceeding the hotel day). I recommend vigilance. The restaurant is open only from 16:00 very poor menu, non-professional service. In general, I advise against it."
5805,"Unfortunately, my trust was disappointed. root canal treatment, for which he took a lot of money, turned out to be unfinished, and the crown and root post was unnecessary, as another dentist showed. It was similar with a supposedly removed tartar. He likes to boast that he is the best and most competent. The advantage is that he is always on the phone, but I wouldn't recommend working with this dentist for a long time. I left 'em with him unfortunately very much money, as it turned out, unnecessarily."
5806,"The first impression was very good. Unfortunately, it soon turned out that the bathroom stinks of sewerage, because of the failure there is no hot water and heating, the hotel restaurant waits for a meal for a long time and not everyone gets the so-called. Wait - I think Mr. Waiter assesses it - me and my son assessed for them: ) but the bitterness was dominated by marcinek - a local delicacy - a piece of cake for 26 zloty, which was very bad - for the first time in my life it happened that she gave me something to the kitchen - I don't know how to serve something like that and it's still in a four-star hotel. The advantages: nice rooms, good breakfasts, good swimming pools, nice and competent staff. We will return to Bialowieza for sure, to this hotel for sure not."
5807,"Medium class hotel (certainly not 4 *), in the middle of the hotel clean, but outside the hotel not always. The swimming pools were not cleaned, only added chlorine, the food was not the worst, but monotonous, i.e. still the same. Weak animations, led only by Turks, who often did not want to organize anything. Not many of the staff speak English."
5808,"Terribly expensive, terrible conditions. The problem with hot water in the bathroom, in the room clouds of dust. The reservation was that I had to pay at check-in. Not knowing why they pulled money from my account before arrival. At the reception desk they didn't even have my reservation saved, they confused my details. The failure on the full line"
5809,"Hello, I've reached Dr. M. Śmigielski with my son ( expectation ) ( 1 year of life ) after getting to know a lot of opinions and information about his person and work. She was a little distant from the great reviews. Both my husband and I were absolutely sure that we would entrust our little one with the operation of Dr. Śmigielski. The perfection was incredible, all explained and understood, the approach to the child, culture and respect for parents. Such doctors can be found today with the proverbial candle. The surgery went according to the plan, we were informed about everything before and after (and Dr Śmigielski and the anesthesiologist and nurse). After the surgery, we are in contact with each other all the time - e-mail, phone. (I live about 300 km from Warsaw) at different times of day. We followed all the Dr.'s recommendations and everything healed perfectly. The little one hates it! I am incredibly"

Upon arrival at the "" hotel "" when registering, they gave em their details by filling in the registration form. At the bottom of the form there was a box for entering the PESEL number as obligatory to fill in. They refused to provide this data, in accordance with the regulations on the protection of personal data of the FAMILY. Unfortunately, the lady at the reception refused to check in. After a conversation with another person, this time from the management, I found out that I will not be registered without giving my PESEL number. And if I don't like it, I can find myself another hotel in the area. And the way the management representative was interviewing the facility was just arrogant. In that case, he left 'em here. I met with the request for a PESEL number for the first time in my many years of business and private travels."
5811,"The hotel is very well located. The room is spacious, nicely furnished. Meals good, but no revelation. WiFi actually does not work. A large aquapark is definitely an attraction. Surcharge for using the fridge in the room, no wipes in the bathroom. A broken hairdryer in the bathroom was only replaced the next day. Generally ok, but there is no craze."
5813,"We arrived at the hotel at 1:00 p.m. and had to wait for the check in until 2:00 p.m. - unfortunately we were not allowed to go to dinner and dinner was not served until 7:30 p.m. We were given room 661 with a view of the swimming pool, a large and spacious room - a room that was cleaned every day - once better and once worse. Unfortunately, the all inclusive option (11:00 - 23:00) disappointed us the most - only one bar from which you can take counterfeit drinks, vodka and beer - all served in plastic cups! ! ! There were no snacks between meals. At night it was a little noisy in the hotel, but with the windows closed, it did not interfere with sleeping. There was no animation at the pool - that's why we used to go to the beach (behind the part with deckchairs we could lay down on a towel). In the evenings, every 2 days you were singing the same songs - all the time. Unfortunately, you couldn't sit by the pool in the evening because there were not enough tables and you had to book the deck chairs for 8 am because there were not enough! As for the food, it was the biggest drama. . . You can't say that we were going hungry but every day it was the same. If not all was eaten for lunch, it was served again for dinner! ! ! And of course the drinking to meals served in plastic cups. . . Once we were in the room in the evening, we heard that something was going on at the pool - it turned out that the owners of the hotel came to prepare a sumptuous table and there was a Bulgarian dance show especially for them. . so they take care of the guests, there was not a single information about the show at the reception. In fact, a lot of hotels were visited because she was working as a resident - but this hotel is not really recommended. We were very disappointed and fortunately we were only there for a week!"
5814,"A remarkable doctor with a human, individual approach to the patient. It is hard to express in words of gratitude to Dr. Haratykova, who helped me a lot. I have been suffering from severe back pain for several years. Different doctors, different diagnoses and no effect. Only the involvement of the doctor in full diagnostics and ordering MRI scans, CT scans and proper rehabilitation helped to a large extent to alleviate the pain and find the cause of my bad health. A very good doctor, by vocation, a great specialist. Warm and patient person, able to listen to the patient. Thank you, Doctor, for not underestimating the problem, all the time spent and kindness."
5817,"Hello, I'm not a demanding tourist. Unfortunately, in the case of Rybaczowka I have to write a linden tree in beautiful surroundings. Nice rooms , nice building . However, being for a week was not even once cleaned in the rooms. Worst of course the showers . Products for breakfast are from Biedronkil. He saw 'em himself as it was brought - bread, eggs and so on. It shouldn't be like that in a guesthouse at the level it sets itself. As far as guests are concerned, guests who have their boat and do not charter from them are not welcome. It is also not too nice for them to feast. Generally speaking, there is also a noticeable division of holidaymakers into Warsaw, Germany and the rest of the world. You have to buy wood for the bonfire - you will only get enough to burn out by 10-10pm. Then everyone looks at you like an intruder. If you want to spend your vacation without having to adjust to the owners' dictates, it is better to rent a house where it will be cheaper and you will be able to light a barbecue or a bonfire without any extra eyes. I won't recommend anything yet, but I won't come back here for sure. ! ! !"

Especially in the post-crisis period, hotels have become active in introducing new fees, i.e. sources of income. No wonder, because according to Professor Hanson, the fees and surcharges are particularly profitable, and most of them achieve profitability of 80 to 90 or even more percent. Fees and surcharges appeared in the practice of the industry in 1997, and from year to year they are increasing, and the revenue of hotels on this account is constantly growing. The exceptions are the periods of declining demand for accommodation, i.e. 2001 and 2009."
5821,"Professional and individual approach to the patient, these features are very much appreciated by me in doctors. Dr Ewa Rybicka is a specialist with these features. Additionally, she is a very nice and smiling person. I reported to Dr. Rybicka with a problem of hyperhidrosis because I was recommended to treat with botox. She was afraid of the pain that accompanied the procedure. However, a nice atmosphere combined with anaesthesia reduced the pain to zero. Before the procedure, the doctor interviewed me in great detail and gave me all the necessary information answering my every question. Going to the surgery she didn't fully believe in the effects, although unnecessarily. I can see a definite improvement, even in stressful situations my shirt under the armpits stays dry :) I am very satisfied and I know that I will definitely return to Dr. Ewa for other treatments."

""Even in such a small group of patients we have observed that there is a division between patients who responded to physical activity - that is, the effort has brought the expected effects such as a decrease in fasting glucose, an increase in insulin sensitivity, or even a decrease in body fat.

5829,"My first visit to this place. A nice doctor who is willing to listen, but also to learn something about the patient. She saw me wanting to find the cause of the problem and not to throw everything away on stress. This is what most doctors do, unfortunately. . However, before me the search for the cause I hope to the end. : - ) ."
5830,"Endoscopic screening has a huge impact on the health of the population and reduces treatment costs, especially for colonoscopy. Early detection of cancers prevents the development of advanced lesions, which are extremely costly to treat in the long term, and therefore allows for significant financial savings. In the past, for example, the role of gastroscopy was to introduce a gastric speculum and detect a large tumor. Now it is possible to diagnose small, early lesions. Thanks to technical progress, the quality of obtained images of the body interior has increased enormously. New endoscopes have already appeared, looking both forward and sideways at the same time, thanks to which the field of vision has increased up to 330 degrees, and the high quality of the image allows for preliminary assessment whether the change looks malignant. An excellent complement is endoscopic ultrasonography, which detects deeper pathologies."
5831,"The doctor tried to prove to me that she is not a gynaecologist as soon as she asked me for the contraceptive pills (I have been taking them for a long time, she asked me for another prescription). What's more interesting, she expressed her astonishment that another gynaecologist-endocrinologist prescribed me the pills because the gynaecologist-endocrinologist is not a gynaecologist and the pills should not be prescribed. At the same time the doctor put a stamp on my other prescription, on which it was clearly written ""obstetrician gynaecologist, endocrinologist"". . . The doctor cannot directly say that she does not issue prescriptions for contraceptive pills because she has such and not other views. I am very disgusted, I will not return to this lady even for a purely endocrinological visit. Covering up with the fact that you suddenly lost one of your specialties just because you are against contraception is at least funny."
5832,"A terrible hotel, you could be filming a horror movie in it. The room - very ugly, dirty, with a terrible view from the window (and the windows very dirty) . Very old, neglected furniture. The smallest TV in the world, only a few channels. Internet didn't work. Bedding of very poor quality. At night it was very loud, you could hear some quarrels at the hotel, breaking bottles. I was honestly worried about my car parked at the main entrance. Bathroom - tragedy, the ugliest bathroom in the world. I was surprised that they had hot water at all. The staff was nice. Although I regret to them that they did not warn me about wasting money. But that's the job they have. Breakfast - nasty, bad, clumsy, very small choice, only coffee was bearable. All the cheapest, fake, not tasty. The ladies from the staff tried their best, took care and wanted to help, add food, but you can just see that the management is very sparse and saves on everything. For such money. . . Honestly, she'd rather sleep in the car than in this hotel. I regret that when she came into my room, she didn't get out of it right away. She was unfortunately so tired of traveling that she just wanted to go to bed and not look for another hotel. I have a lesson for the future. I strongly advise against it and once again advise against it."
5833,"Very good contact with the patient. Friendly atmosphere, which was very important for me because I was very afraid of visiting a psychiatrist. She got me to Mrs. Annie in great fear. I have been afraid of fears and panic attacks for some time now. She was afraid of taking medication, but Mrs. Ania calmed me down, explained everything, what I could expect, and what is only my fears without any basis. It's amazing that after the visit she felt better. I know it is temporary and short term, but Anna gave me hope for a better life. I highly recommend to all the undecided: )"
5834,"Bright, clean, homely, beautiful. Many polished details, very good standard of finish. Comfortable and spacious beds, large bathrooms, with a taste of selected accessories and those small things that make a difference (express machine with capsules, kettle + cups, tea and sugar, hotel slippers, delicate cosmetics in the bathroom, dryer - I did not miss anything). In addition, nice staff, and of course, a great location - a beret throw from the pier. I will definitely be back!"
5835,"He bought 'em in Saturn for 70pln. . . For this price you can buy better Sennheisers. . . When it comes to headphones, they don't have any bass and they're a little shy. . . My broken MX 270 with a single headset gives better sound quality than the obi-efficient Jabra Chill. . . I don't know about the other phones but my Lumia 1020 didn't want to work with the remote control on the cable. Sometimes pressing it would turn the music off and turn it down thoroughly when it was turned on again, so I had to pull the phone out anyway and give it more volume again. And the remote control itself leaves a lot to be desired. Instead of making a small button on the remote control, like any other company, the whole remote control is a stupid button, which makes it not always work, and another time the whole structure creaks when you press it and you don't seem to press it. If the prices once fall to ~30pln then I recommend you to buy. As long as you can buy other headphones such as Sennheiser at the same price, there is nothing to look at."
5836,"Unfortunately, the hotel has a big problem with keeping clean. It is not a new hotel, the design is quite depressing, but it does not relieve the staff from cleaning. Both the room and the bathroom were dirty. There was a dead spider in the wardrobe. The bathroom toilets were effectively discouraged. Parking is additionally paid. The restaurant offers burgers and soups, but prices are quite high. Breakfast is a Swedish buffet, very modest. I will definitely not choose this hotel on my next visit to Lublin."
5837,"The doctor has a lot of knowledge. She looks at the patient as a whole and not just through the prism of an organ that is sick. She has helped me not only to improve the condition of the chronically ill intestines, but she has also distracted me from other doctors' ideas, which are not necessarily the right ones. The doctor contributed to the fact that after 3 years of effort I managed to get pregnant when other doctors claimed that my intestinal disease has no effect on fertility. A big plus for the possibility of telephone consultations, thanks to which you do not have to commute for visits and consultations from other Polish cities. The treatment is not short term but effective. What is equally important, it is not based on accidentally prescribed medications often not very good for our health, but on the best quality preparations and probiotics."
5838,"good doctor at first sight as well as talking but it changes after the effects of the treatment, I after the removal under general anesthesia I have no objections but as for the treatment it is after a year of the next general anesthesia and the removal of almost everything left, after the complaint of the restoration (which lasted a month) I am still without teeth and money - the effect - two prostheses (of course they broke), the teeth are not cured and still I am still toothbrushing for bagatelle only over 10 000 PLN so that I believe in / in the doctor is only suitable for the removal of teeth for sure not for treatment (I mean, of course, the whole clinic)."

5840,"The room is tight, not very clean and awful smelling of cigarettes, the bedclothes are poisoned. Directly outside the window parking lot with buses . It is impossible to sleep: from behind the window, in the corridor, from the reception desk and from behind all walls you can hear every sound. Disastrous location: a gas station (! ) at the hotel itself, a noisy ring road and a busy shopping centre across the street. Bad Breakfast: theoretically quite a large selection of dishes but everything is probably in the worst quality available. Three stars for this ""hotel"" is a complete misunderstanding."
5841,"The doctor was running my daughter under neurology last year. I was very disappointed with him. After the first visit, when my daughter was 6 months old, he found a slight limpness in her legs and nothing more, he had to come back in half a year, he did not recommend any exercises. I came back after 4 months, because I saw that my daughter was developing abnormally, that there was a chasm between her and her bicycles. He ordered a blood test and said that we could possibly start the exercise, but in general we should get used to the fact that the daughter will be different! ! ! He didn't give any clue how, where and with whom to practice. After this visit we consulted with 4 more neurologists (including in Warsaw), we immediately started intensive rehabilitation when the daughter was one year old and was suspected of even cerebral palsy. Now the daughter is more than 2 years old, she is walking and developing, although her development is still delayed in relation to her cyclists. The doctor didn't see the danger, he let us sleep through a very important period, when the rehabilitation could be caught up a lot. He didn't even recommend an ultrasound on the head, and when the daughter was a year old, the body had already overgrown and the ultrasound couldn't be done. Very bad experience and I definitely do not recommend it."
5842,"I was at your doctor's place a few years ago and I must say he helped me a lot. She was having trouble with hemorrhoids and their itching. He prescribed me a prescription for ointment made in a pharmacy, cheap and revolving. I still use it today whenever I feel something is happening. Thanks to this ointment, I didn't need any intervention on hemorrhoids. The ointment is doing the job. None, not even the expensive pharmacy's. Thank you, Doctor! ! ! One thing I have to admit is that the rectoscopy examination was very painful, although I have no comparison, because it was my only one such examination."
5843,"We've spent 2 nights. We were very pleasantly surprised. A very nice and functional room. Clean. Staff very helpful and courteous. Breakfast is fantastic. Thank you. We recommend it. We're going out again. It's a shame that we're only going for one night. We can get to the center by one tram. Once again, I recommend."
5844,"I went to Mrs. Polakowska because she had very good reviews on this portal. However, not entirely, Mrs. Polakowska met my expectations. First of all, she had to wait 20 minutes because, which is disrespectful to me, she talked on the phone at that time. When she came into my office, she told me that she wanted me to do either a five or two. The doctor said the cavity was 5 and 6. She asked what she would have wanted me to do in such a case, to which she replied that in such a case 5. After about 15 minutes. - 20 min . she got up from the chair and immediately asked me when I could make an appointment to do 6 and 2 . Then she found out to m that 6 was also done to me. It surprised me a little bit because from what I know these are my teeth and not the doctor's, so by her grace she could at least ask if I wanted to do two teeth at the same time and what is important if I am financially prepared for it. She paid me 270 zloty for this service and luckily she had that much with her. I'm curious if she didn't have so much money with me. Apart from my personal uncomfortable feeling, I leave a neutral comment because the teeth themselves have been done well."
5845,"I warn against removing the large buttons, their fixing is a gloomy joke of the manufacturer, 1mm plastic tongs which broke after the FIRST gentle attempt to insert them (already breaking one of four causes the button to fall out). The best joke, however, is the lack of possibility to buy broken keys which makes the keyboard useless. Another disadvantage of this keyboard is that it has a space bar that is created from notoriously pressing on one side. After three years, the keyboard fell off the desk breaking the last shift (the first one broken during cleaning) classifying the keyboard as scrap metal because even a drop of it did not help. It was my last purchase in this price range. However, I prefer cheaper and more durable keyboards, i.e. A4tech without these bits and pieces of paper like automatic backlighting ( ordinary is enough ) ."
5846,"We've been here for 5 days. The staff practically wore us on their hands. From morning till evening we smiled. They are always there to help us. Breakfast is very generous and delicious. Dinner was impossible to pass (2 types of menu available). I do not understand not satisfied with the options of drinks paid extra . I assume it is written by people who do not fully understand the term Hotel. I have not yet met the dinner option (whether in Poland or abroad) where the drinks would not be paid extra. Unless we are talking about the ALL option. . . ( the hotel does not offer it so you should not be surprised ) Generally we will recommend it to everyone. . . The proximity to the resort of Czarna Góra will not mention the beautiful surroundings, climate of the building and sauna."
5849,"It's just my second visit to the doctor, but I'm happy. Finally, I found a doctor who doesn't comfort me that there's nothing to worry about but it worked. She got me medication and advice and I hope it will work soon. The doctor is nice and factual."
5850,"Hello? Yes, the doctor examined me and gave me a referral for an MRI which costs 600 PLN in contrast. But even I didn't receive a prescription for pain medication, it's not what I expected from a specialist about sick leave, not to mention that I would have to ask the patient how he needs it because I work physically and not like a doctor on a chair although I know that sitting on a chair is nothing good I don't recommend because you pay for the visit 200 PLN and so the lack of a prescription for pain medication won't help even if it's the biggest mistake for me."
5851,"According to prof . Magdalena Bielska - Lasota from the National Institute of Public Health PZH, the treatment of rare cancers is also at a good level. In our country, 41 thousand people suffer from 186 types of such cancers, i.e. 22% of all oncological patients. Five-year survival is achieved in 48% of patients, the same as the average in European Union countries. In her opinion, the effectiveness of treatment would be even higher if all patients could be treated in reference centres. ""On the other hand, supportive treatment is not sufficient"" - said Dr Jerzy Jarosz from the Oncology Centre in Warsaw . First of all because we use too little opioid analgesics. The use of these agents is still as much as five times lower than in most other European countries, such as Great Britain, Germany and Sweden."
5852,"advantages: large room, nice service in the restaurant, cafe and SPA, small but pleasant pool, downsides: Unpleasant service at the reception, the swimming pool can be used only during the designated hours with 2 breaks 11-12 and 14-16 (no information about breaks in the use of the pool on the hotel's website), no bathrobes in the room, no internet in the rooms, the internet works only at the reception, café and in the corridor in front of the room (internet started to work after many hours of interventions), In the parking lot, the cameras are set up for everything but not for the cars standing there (I have a damaged car and it is not possible to find out who did it), too small a washbasin in the bathroom, lukewarm water in the shower, poor water pressure, poor breakfast, no coffee maker (what they serve as coffee is not suitable for drinking)."
5854,"The pension is very nice in rooms and bathrooms clean and tidy. However, I did not like a few things there, such as the lack of a kettle in the room, which in the evening or morning you can not do anything warm to drink, you would have to go downstairs to the bar where the prices for coffee or tea are ridiculously high between 6 - 8zł per cup. Wi - fi in our room wasn't working in practice, the straight side of the bar was charging for 10 minutes. Lack of possibility to light a cigarette on the balcony which for me smoker is very annoying because every time you have to dress up and march outside in front of the reception. In general, the guesthouse is good for one day but for a longer stay it does not meet my expectations."
5856,"My husband paid 150 PLN for the semen tests and when he received the results, she thought I would have a heart attack. He wrote his semen tests on a piece of paper on which doctors usually write how to take medicines. On such a ridiculous piece of paper was written the name, surname and sperm tests in the norm. WOMAN and 150 PLN went into the mud. He also said he had varicose veins on his testicles. He himself has varicose veins but in his brain. Avoid his wide arch."
5857,"However, it is quite a concrete alternative and for objects which do not want - or for financial reasons - can no longer be associated with e.g. brands belonging to large chains, and for independent objects which do not manage - or do not manage very well - on the market. Since Magnuson Worldwide - which the chain stresses quite strongly - operates mainly on two markets: the American and British, it does not seem that the presented solution is available for Polish hotels. However, it is always worth knowing that such business models also exist so that someone - if they consider them to be sensible and beneficial - can introduce similar solutions to the Polish market. Magnuson Hotels presents itself as the largest independent hotel chain. In the eight years of its existence, Magnuson Hotels has become the fastest growing hotel chain comprising 1,800 hotels with over 140,000 rooms (which gives it 12th place among the largest hotel groups in the world) located in the USA and Great Britain."
5858,"I went to see your psychologist some time ago. In total, I made several visits. You are very nice, but unfortunately you do not listen to the patient. I also had the impression that she laughed at me and that she may have had an ironic attitude to what I was saying. I gave her another chance, but the situation was repeated. Every time she visited me she nodded, she gave me no advice, no clues. I do not recommend visiting you."
5859,"A unique place in spite of its exceptional ""unfriendliness"": ) . Very large and clean apartments, arranged with simplicity and taste. Not for native fuckers! ! ! Bedroom, bathroom, hallway with wardrobe, living room with balcony (or ground floor with terrace) connected to the kitchen. Extra-standard equipment (for this money exceptional - e.g. microwave). We have been here twice. Nice atmosphere despite the not very interesting surroundings. Is there anything missing? - Say - The brothers will complete it. The microclimate created mainly by the Dutch and Greek restingers . The deep pool relaxes perfectly. Weed, olive trees and peace and quiet. The often mentioned airplanes quickly stop being noticed. The Kritzas Brothers Tavern is a mini gem. It can be stuffy, but the quality and taste of the dishes compensates for these inconveniences. And you do not have to worry about the quantity : ) Everything is fresh and local - that's how it is in Crete. The downside is the distance from the big supermarket and the ktel'a stop (such a Cretan pks) . Quite a decent beach nearby. We recommend and our friends also ."
5860,"Hello , Today I found 'em at the Politanski Hotel completely out of chance. Arrival at the reception desk at 10 p.m. Mr. at the reception desk already offended with someone at this time of night disturbing him, I take the key I go to the second floor looking for a room dimmer (no lighting in the hallway, i.e. motion detectors are but not working) I was saved by a torch on the phone. In the morning time has breakfast of course tea in the thermos two bags has two liters (savings probably) dry sausage, rigid yellow cheese, I ask the waiter for two eggs planted in butter and you strongly refuse to justify that there are only two and there are seventy breakfasts! ! ! I look around the room and I counted 6 people ( six ) I DON'T RECOMMEND! Such places should be closed immediately."
5861,"We know the guest's predispositions and habits, so it's a shame to waste our time on unnecessary nuances when we know what the reservation will end up with anyway. Another example is, for example, a telephone conversation with a person driving a car or for any other reason not having the time or appropriate concentration on conducting advanced negotiations. Here we also present one concrete proposal, which in many situations will be sufficient. Although the presented proposals are general schemes, remember to personalise the sent offers. So try not to send a pre-prepared PDF with offers for everyone, but based on the articulated needs, to present an individual proposal for each request."
5863,"Although the first impression when entering the hotel did not knock you on your knees, all that followed was full satisfaction with your stay. Rooms overlooking the trail, always clean, service at the highest level. You're not complaining about the lack of soap cosmetics or body lotion, you're not looking for the staff to bed linen or clean the room. The staff is always nice and helpful. A richly varied breakfast, delicious restaurant meals and again a nice service. He wanted me to get on with something, but let's not be a trifle. I consider the stay to be successful. Now you need a diet! : )"
5864,"What attracts the attention of smaller foreign investors to the markets of individual countries are certainly transactions involving large facilities, which, although few in number, make the value of the aftermarket value thanks to the scale. For example, three such transactions with a total value of over €100 million were made in Poland last year. This year, although the first half of the year was rather ""sleepy"" in terms of both volume and value, more than €100 million will be achieved by one transaction - the sale of the InterContinental hotel in Warsaw. This, undoubtedly record-breaking sales on our market, may be achieved still in the summer. The good results of some hotels during Euro 2012 certainly draw attention to the Polish hotel market, but investors are looking to the market in the long term. If the autumn manages to maintain the growing trend of improving the results achieved by hotels in the spring, a greater number of investors will certainly be interested in accommodation facilities in a more real and not just declarative way."
5865,"The professor denied my opinion about my child ( not medical ) . He tried to bring me to the ground floor by the size of his authority. And he showed his ""great personal culture"" by talking to me with his mouth full of cake, which he ate while talking. When his symptoms didn't match his description of the child, he decided that the problem was definitely at home. He verified his opinion only after the interview with the child in the group of students, who did not confirm his theory and obtaining the opinion of a neuropsychologist, which also corrected it. It is a pity that he obtained this opinion on the day of the discharge and his corrected conclusions were not included in the epicry."
5866,"The representatives of the PTO are particularly counting on the development of the latter, i.e. organisation of, among others, fairs, congresses, trainings and exhibitions. Tourists, who come to the country for such a purpose, spend on average three times what ordinary tourists spend. Now, thanks to the development of appropriate infrastructure, we can try to attract them to Poland. This is the so-called ""higher shelf in tourism"". So far we have had a problem with places where we can organize such events. Thanks to the fact that stadiums have been created, which are also multifunctional congress centres, thanks to the construction of new congress centres in Kraków and Katowice, conditions are being created in Poland for inviting guests and organizing events in the field of business tourism"", says Dr Adam Zaborowski. The development of business tourism is also one of the opportunities to ensure the profitability of new facilities after the European Football Championship. According to the Impact Report, commissioned by the Ministry of Sport and Tourism, thanks to Euro 2012, every year our country will be visited by half a million more tourists than in previous years. Last year, just over 13 million people came to Poland. The revenues in tourism are to increase by 5 billion PLN by 2020. According to Dr. Zaborowski, this will translate into the development of the whole economy by creating new jobs in new facilities, hotels and stadiums."
5867,"A great picture of an ectopic pregnancy. It's just a shame my doctor didn't diagnose it that way. With a 5 minute visit (for 150zl), the diagnosis could actually be difficult. Two days after the visit she was diagnosed on old equipment in the hospital in Pabianice (where she arrived in an ambulance). She was operated on at night (the oviduct burst and blood was drained from the abdominal cavity) The doctor claimed that the pregnancy had to be younger, even though she told him that it was impossible because she had a monitoring cycle and I know when the bubble burst (she got an injection on the burst and I was still able to check if it burst). She also told me that she examined the beta and gave me the result. She heard me not to do the beta any more to arm myself with patience and come in two weeks. Did the doctor see anything minimal on the uterus? No one but the doctor saw any bubbles on it. It came to him with blotches and pain located on the left side (this should already guide the doctor). When she came back from the doctor she thought that I was just roning spontaneously and I was panicking. She was supposed to take drugs after my grandmother and sleep through the pain because she knew I was pregnant. She was calm because the doctor wrote ""in appendages without pathology"". Fortunately, she wasn't alone and the relatives managed to call an ambulance. Fortunately, I got pregnant later and gave birth to a healthy daughter. The whole pregnancy, however, I had to see 3 doctors because I was afraid that someone would miss something again. She will never again restore confidence in the health service. I do not recommend it."
5868,"The hotel after reconstruction and refurbishment makes a very nice impression. The service is nice and helpful. The rooms are clean and tidy. No wardrobes in the rooms outside the small recess. Unfortunately, at least in the part of the hotel where I lived, the bathrooms in the rooms are plastic Formula I cabins, which cause under-rating. The night was spent in a room overlooking a busy street, but the noise did not reach. I have no idea if there is air conditioning in it. Breakfast is very modest: baguette, croissants, jams, yoghurt, fruit. No cold cuts. Very good coffee."
5869,"The review does not concern the performances of the bands, but the conditions in which they take place. Despite the high ticket prices, only entry to the sector is guaranteed, which makes it necessary to arrive a few hours in advance to have a seat on the benches (without even plastic chairs or seats). There are no stairs, railings - dusty and grassy surface - in case of rain it sinks in mud, also under the benches. No canopy. It is good to come in a group, because it is necessary, to watch, to have a place. Access to toilets is difficult, so it is better to limit drinking. Only one entrance gate, with problematic control, because part of the audience had glass bottles. One narrow access road, parked by cars parked on both sides, which at the time of leaving the amphitheater by spectators made it impossible for an ambulance and fire brigade to pass. In a word, a great pleasure from participating in a super - extra concert spoiled by the organizer. Pity ."
5870,"The hotel requires renovation, old furniture, bed linen, varied food and a large selection but very poor quality, dirty canteen, service rather nice but during your stay not once did not clean the room, swimming pool ok, clean water, lifeguard not interested in anything but the phone, the hotel is relatively close to the center of the golden sands and beach."
5871,"amazing building ! and a great view from the window to the surrounding area : ) room (two rooms in total) large and comfortable, simple design, but it's a plus very comfortable beds and a warm bathroom ;) nice accent with pictures on the corridors, especially for those who prefer stairs: A restaurant with beautiful views. . . . Breakfast tasty but quite monotonous, for five days we ate the same thing :) Dinners good, although soups could be less salty, very good fish and a lot of vegetables: Unfortunately, desserts were weak, cakes were chemical and tastelessplus for preparing activities for children during the holidays and a photo wake ; ) Mr. animators very nice although the children's room could be opened much earlier, even without staff - because what to do with the kids at 7 a.m. in winter another plus for the children's tvzabieg spa program professional and super relaxinginus for soup water in the jacuzzi: (hotel staff nice and helpful warning to the way of cleaning the room - sometimes a vacuumed room, sometimes a corridor, sometimes a shower cabin washed, sometimes not, Tea completed once during the entire stay of the party a nasty accent at the end - Cleaning ladies occupy the elevator with carts while guests move out10 minutes waiting for the elevator (penultimate floor) - when the elevator finally arrives the door opens and there the lady with the cart, helpless look, the door closes the elevator goes down and guests are still waiting in warm jackets and luggage: ) nevertheless, the stay in the hotel was very successful"
5872,"In the first half of this year, foreigners coming to Poland spent 4 017 million euros. Compared to the same period last year, these expenses increased by 10.4%. The number of foreigners who came to Poland increased by 10.4%, i.e. by 380 million euros. At the same time, due to foreign trips, Poles spent 3 055 million euros. In comparison with the same period last year, these expenses increased by 433 million euros, i.e. by 16.5% . According to NBP data. According to a geographical analysis of expenditures, in the entire first half of 2012 expenditures of foreigners from EU countries in Poland exceeded 65% of revenues from foreign trips. On the other hand, the expenditures of Poles on foreign travels to EU countries accounted for over 83% of total expenditures on account of foreign travels. In comparison with the previous year, the number of foreigners from the European Union countries was higher than the number of foreigners from the European Union countries. In comparison with last year, the expenditure of Poles in EU countries increased, while the expenditure of EU citizens in Poland decreased ."
5873,"This is my first visit to Dr. Weed, I am not able to assess her competence yet, but the first impression is very positive. Nice, factual, she listens to what the patient says and what is important delicate during the examination. I will be able to judge more later. Because there will probably be another visit: ) Visit with ultrasound 100 PLN . No price list on the website, unfortunately, so I went in the knowledge of how much I will pay. Greetings"
5875,"I'm 28 years old. I came to your doctor with skin problems in the form of acne and pathologically falling out hair. The doctor ordered a number of tests and suggested treatment. She also did not underestimate the falling out hair, prescribing the appropriate medicine. During the visit Mrs. Giderewicz was specific, friendly and polite. Currently I am waiting for another visit. I recommend ."
5876,"On the day of the reception of the tower, the unmistakable first feature is the corrosion protection of the materials from which it was made. As you can see in the attached pictures, the corrosion is proceeding on the connecting elements. On the lacquered ones I did not notice. The saddle clamp visible on the pictures has been replaced by too short a 30mm Allen screw and a nut. The front brake is difficult to compare with a leaking bicycle brake. It is even far from old constructions e.g. from Wigry 3 . With the price of 200 zloty I might have less requirements."
5877,"Hotel located in a fantastic place with a beautiful view of the Motlawa river. Beautifully integrated into the surroundings. Rooms, even standard rooms, large, very well equipped. Large, clean bathroom with a choice of baths and showers. Nice swimming pool. Breakfast is very tasty. The staff is courteous and reacts quickly to any complaints of shortcomings. Close to the Old Town of Gdansk. Nearby many very nice pubs serving delicious menu . I recommend ."
5878,"We know the price is low for a day, so there is nothing to expect, but our surprise at the entrance was enormous. The staircase is so small that only one person can pass through and the stench of moisture, it's molded. Rooms smaller than the cell with one stool and a hanging cupboard. The toilet is old and dirty, the shower is the same. Fear was to go wash up. The best was an off-limits alarm that would go on steam when you opened the door from the bathroom. The key was jammed in the entrance door and there was a problem with opening it. The old gentleman at the reception desk was mean to the rentals. I do not recommend this place even for a short stay."
5879,"you gave me a negative opinion because of the level of service in the clinic, which directly translates into the quality of the visit. In response, the doctor called me and, as an apology, offered a free examination, for which I thank you very much. However, my opinion was reported to the moderator as a violation (apparently the statistics on a well-known doctor are very important) . The doctor is nice and friendly, but I will not go to her anymore because 2 of the 3 appointments did not take place (and they were cancelled at the last minute or the day before). If someone has time to make such an appointment, I recommend it because I am sure she knows her profession well. Of course the visit ended with buying glasses. The diagnosis and recommendations were known to me only at the reception of glasses, because in the clinic there is such a division of duties that the ladies from the reception read the patient's card and pass everything to him (unless they forget themselves as in my case)."
5880,"We spent 2 nights there in September. The hotel is in a good, safe area, near the underground station. However, it is very noisy at night, especially if the balcony is on the street side. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and cozy. We had a shared bathroom but it was almost always free."
5881,"These studies have shown that the unique ability to heal (regenerate) the skin without scars occurs in a particular type of mice, the so-called naked mice. This biological phenomenon is caused by a mutation (inactivity) of one gene - Foxn1 . Interestingly, in both mice and humans, the Foxn1 gene occurs only in two areas of the body: the skin and the thymus (an organ that disappears during the development of an individual) - explained prof . Gawrońska - Kozak . ""The question we asked ourselves a few years ago was: Is it possible that this one gene is responsible for scarring? The information available at that time concerned the function of the Foxn1 gene in the thymus, there was not much work on the presence in the skin, and there was no work on its contribution to the healing of skin wounds"" - emphasized the scientist."
5882,"Your doctor was recommended to me by a close friend. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed. Dr. M. was a reticent, dry and not very interested in my person. The visit lasted about five minutes, she didn't hear anything concrete and paid 150 PLN. There is no ultrasound in the office, which is, in my opinion, a fundamental shortcoming. Sitting in the waiting room, if you don't want to, you can hear the conversation in the office, which shouldn't happen. I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST IT!"
5883,"A medium quality hotel, rooms and furnishings are obsolete. I don't know why we have a room that is accessible for the disabled. The view of the roof, where the dead birds, petting and other rubbish lay. The only advantage is the proximity to the station. In the Old Town, on the other hand, about 20 minutes walk."
5884,"She was at Dr. Cieślik's for consultations. After talking to him, I know I won't go to him for the procedure. The doctor didn't want to tell me an approximate price for the procedure, he said that if I am determined I should report to him with a complete set of tests and then he will tell me the exact price. But when it comes to the information about the procedure, he explained everything exactly. Eventually she paid m 100 PLN for the consultation so she would be surprised if I didn't. As for the clinic, where the doctor takes a little unfriendly to patients - ladies at the reception desk gossip about patients and their cases drinking coffee. In a word, I do not recommend"
5885,"Hello, I'm after my second visit to the doctor's and I'm not hiding that I'm positively surprised. My three-year-old daughter has been coughing for a year, earlier pediatricians recommended syrups for allergies, inhalations. . . The doctor referred us to the examination on her first visit. Moreover, she noticed that the child has to be examined by an ophthalmologist because ""barley"" is, in her opinion, a hail and treatment is advisable. The assumptions turned out to be correct . I recommend ."
5886,"I thought that if you book something in the dark, it's a power cord because it will maintain quality - an error. The room - dirty walls - and that's supposedly the one after the renovation. I had to ask if before or after, because I was promised to renovate, and there was a certain that I got one for the renovation. In the room next door party. Please help the reception desk, they promise to call back - nobody's calling back. I'm calling again - supposedly they asked for some peace. So I come down to change the room. . . The other room - the lock doesn't work, I can't come in. I'm going back to the reception desk again (very slow elevator, so I'm already annoyed). . . No apologies, nothing. . . Breakfast: I felt it was the lowest quality ingredients. 3 types of cheese, 2 cold cuts, white cheese, sausages, pancakes. The scrambled eggs stood in a large amount of unknown liquid so at the time when it was 'em, none of the guests tried. Parking: I barely squeezed 'em probably on the last available place (it was 22 : 00) Location: apart from the shopping center and the gas station next door - I don't see anything else nearby (e.g. old town, restaurants, bars - by car). Very big noise from the street - in the summer it is difficult to sleep with the window open, although usually such things do not bother me."
5887,"Well, the hotel is well located, the SPA and the ... . . .nothing else. The hotel is going for the opinion it has earned right after opening. It's very clear the lack of a good manager who could run the hotel. The client is very much in second place here, unfortunately. The hotel is NOT adapted for the disabled! ! ! The hotel is also suitable for families with children - in order to go down to the sealarium or zoo we have two exits: either a few dozen steep stairs or around the village: ( . ZOO - neglected, overgrown, no smaller animals are visible from the high grass. FOKARIUM - here you can see the involvement of working people. We were at the Feeding Show at the hour. 18 : 00 - the leader was very committed to the skills of the seals. JAZDA KONNA - unfortunately, there is also a lack of commitment of the working people . RESTAURANCE - dirty cutlery, glasses, monotonous food (no bread!!) waiting for the table - in a word, not good. SPA - I sincerely recommend! ! ! There is no smallest shop - a point where you can buy basic hygiene products, water to drink etc. We have been informed that in the tree house where we were accommodated there is a coffee bar and ... . . .was a kettle and plastic cups. No trace of cups, coffee or tea. When asked at the reception desk about the above, she heard that ""I can take it from the restaurant"" - poorly: ( . (when she wanted to use salt, she heard the m - please look in the hall)."
5888,"The hotel is of a general level deviating from European standards, especially its all-inclusive option. They still have a lot to learn . Just a poor menu, formalism in its implementation (each signature, limiting the number of orders, observing the minute of dispensing drinks - knocked out 11 . 00 refusal to serve a meal or a drink) the food offer is not very varied, breakfast below criticism, lack of interest, it is true that as a result of probable failure, but nothing was done to remove it at all, the hotel is not worthy of interest and recommendation"
5889,"Who : Marcin Szxxxak mgr Co : Physics Exercise Where : WPPT , IB assessment : 4 upward trend [ / b ] Generally not a bad leader . He or she is only learning, although there are differences in the treatment of people who have talent and those who do not. I would rather not count on a positive point than a negative one. Solving the tasks is simply typing a wretch, you hardly hear from him. He almost always has ideas for solving tasks, and the same almost always has solutions for Doctor TYC. I recommend it for people with physical talent, and for those who have the sting to sting; )"
5890,"Avoid this center with a wide arch of dirt, stench and poverty. If you want to visit the museum of the 1920s it is Storczyk. In the windows and doors there are 5 cm holes in all the walls of the floor, bedding is tattered. Bathrooms ino you can get mycosis and many other diseases. Worst center she's ever seen in my life."
5891,"Pigeonshame ! I skip what anyone likes - small or large centers but there are limits . . . in the nightclub she ordered m 3 margaritas - the first one was a mix with pseudo liqueur (substitute for triple sec) and lemon juice . . . fake ! I am not able to describe this taste. . . . asked me to serve tequila with lemon juice (there was no question of lime - maybe it's an unknown fruit) - she heard m from the bartender for them. . . . .squeezers. . . . . she asked me to serve the lemon separately - which she squeezed out the m . . . .

Mr. Bar Manager Gołębiewski - your "" recipe "" at the price is a mockery of people ! Is it because of the philosophy of a Pole you can squeeze everything ?"
5892,"Unfortunately, I cannot give a positive assessment of the Victoria Hotel. The conditions there are similar to those of the 1990s. At first glance, the hotel looks pretty good. It is located at the very beginning of Szklarska Poreba and is about 10 minutes walk to the center. The rooms may have been clean but they didn't go crazy. Breakfast is quite, quite. Maybe it was the same every day, but I think there was something to choose from. Breakfast was served at an hour. 9 : 00 - 10 : 30 but you had to be at the 9 : 00 point to get something. She didn't notice that the food was being added so after 10, there were only leftovers left. As for the service, it was the first time she met the same person in the hotel as a cook, cleaner and receptionist. One gentleman at the reception showed a total lack of professionalism, treating guests as his colleagues forgetting about the principle of ""Our Lord's client"" (he answered questions in a spraying manner). In the price of the room we had the opportunity to use the SPA type: sauna, jacuzzi and massages. As far as the sauna is concerned, we had to report 2 hours beforehand the intention to use it so that it could heat up. Jacuzzi is such a bigger bathtub max . 4-person bathtub with bubbles . Unfortunately, we did not use it often because the water smelled unpleasant: (And the massages were to be performed using some kind of massage bed, but unfortunately, during the whole stay the bed was the FULL TIME OF SUSTAINABLE! ! ! The hotel has a billiard room, but in order to play you would probably have to have your own poles because these hotel poles are not suitable for anything and certainly not for playing. It was similar with ping-pong rackets and a ping-pong table. The whole trip was saved, however, by the fact that there was beautiful weather and great company, but as for the hotel, I do NOT recommend it."
5893,"A very good doctor and a nice man. She was at Dr. Heel's to pick out the contraceptive pills. She was a little bit afraid of me because the previous ones chosen by another doctor had a bad effect on my health. Dr . Dr. Heel first thoroughly interviewed me and chose the pills that serve me. He also carried out all the necessary tests (which is unfortunately not the norm in others) and after some time, I developed an infection. She was quickly cured. During each visit, the doctor answered all the questions, informed about the activities and what he learned from each examination. I recommend it to everyone, especially young girls who are afraid of visiting a gynaecologist. After one visit to the doctor's office all fears will disappear: )"
5895,"This year we took advantage of the Easter package, we spent our time happily and with family. However, there was a lack of music in the lobby bar and Christmas dancing. The time was made more pleasant by the pool and three super saunas, a nice paddling pool for children, attractions for parents and children (table football, games room, fitness room) and tasty food. We will gladly return to this place when they fix the road. Thank you! ! !"
5896,"I've been staying at the hotel for the third time and I think it's the last time. All this by not respecting regular customers (staying in a hotel for the first time you can get a better price than staying in a hotel for some time in a row). In addition, the room is cold and contact with the hotel via e-mail is impossible."
5897,"We were very unhappy to stay in this hotel! ! 3 nights in a row, which we didn't receive breakfast, but packed nasty packages with black bread, stinking fast and pepper. . . . .we used the restaurant once, because that's all they allowed us to do. ... we waited 40 minutes for a beer, not to mention the food, we could only order fried cheese despite the fact that the restaurant was open until 24:00! ! ! ! The rooms were hot, tiny clinics. . . . .not to mention the hole in the towels! ! Definitely not recommended! ! ! !"
5898,"When you're going on a business trip, you want to relax, be careful of the renovation. Unfortunately, when entering the room, you could not hear the phone call over the room wall ball one big nightmare. She asked my reception to start the morning with 9 where 7am woke up with a big bang and as much as she drew my attention at the reception it did not react. The hotel meets the conditions of 4 star good food . Unfortunately the team renovated everything and it was enough to close the renovated wing and not accommodate guests there."
5899,"Sol d'or is well located and very clean, but these are its greatest advantages. The service is nice and helpful, but unfortunately he speaks poorly English. The food is not very good, everything is greasy, usually not very spicy and is made with the Russians and Spaniards in mind, who are the most in this place. I strongly recommend that you stand in line and eat what you do freshly at the grill. The decor is not modern, but it is neat and tidy. You should also be prepared for the animations that last until midnight. Sometimes they are bearable (e.g. flamenco show) and sometimes they do not allow you to sleep or rest (e.g. medium live concerts). The hotel is just the right place to sleep, but definitely not to spend all your time."
5900,"Halina Plokarz, Dr. Course: Physics II ( laboratory ) [ / b ] Well, there's no discussion here - Mrs. Plokarz is a really decent lab girl. Of course, you have to be able to COS (or even more) to stay on the labs, but this is compensated for by the smooth running of the classes. Grandmother can even announce from week to week that she will be asking this and this group, so the landing from the hares only takes place""."
5901,"The diagnosis is good, but I'm not going back to this office. The visit lasted. . . 3 minutes? I couldn't tell you exactly what and how, I made the diagnosis barely a glance. When I expressed my doubts and wanted to continue discussing how it started at all, the doctor dismissed me, wrote a prescription and briefed me as if in a hurry. He did not dispel the doubts, he did not calm down. He left me not believing in his judgment because he had no time to answer questions. After these few minutes, he issued a bill for PLN 100."
5902,"I'm just lying down after an unsuccessful salty dinner in my bed under the duvet when it's minus 12 degrees outside. The apartment is crossbow, cold. . . . .in the restaurant a young girl who gives a child juice in a glass bottle with a tube, an adult beer from the bottle already poured, fat pancakes - massacre. . . the meat was only good. . . ...I was disappointed with the cleanliness and the kitchen really looks nice from the outside..."
5903,"According to Dr Agnieszka Jarosz from the Institute of Food and Nutrition in Warsaw, only every fourth person in our country pays attention to the salt content of products. This is indicated by a study carried out by the Institute of Food and Nutrition in Warsaw on 288 people aged 18 to 60 years, 65% of whom were women. We still check mainly the calorific value of the food and the fat and carbohydrate content. The salt content is quite significantly diversified even in the same type of food. For example, vegetable spices in 100 g contain from 21 to even 70 g of salt. Salt is also in large quantities in other spices. Dr. Stoś gave as an example lemon pepper , in which there may be more salt than pepper !"
5905,"A small hotel, very nice and very nice location right by the sea, with a nice sandy beach and yellow sand, beautiful clean sea with shallow water far away. The beds are payable 7 Euros for two. Swimming pools by the hotel nice and clean with a small slide for children. The animations are rather symbolic, although the animators are very nice and willing to help or play. The rooms are clean, cleaned daily, almost all with views of the pools and the sea. The food is quite varied, different kinds of meat and in different forms. A lot of vegetables, salads rather modest, little fruit, mostly watermelons. The bar is located between the swimming pools and the sea, nice service, drinks rather weak, light beer, OK. Tsilivi Centre not far away, nice town on one main street, full of tourists in the evening. The island itself is worth a visit, the Caretta tortoises can actually be seen, a beautiful coast with blue caves, to be seen from the sea, sometimes you can see the dolphins, although from a distance. The airport is quite close, transfer through closer hotels about 30 minutes. Generally a beautiful island and a great holiday!"
5906,"Location is great, all close on foot. The hotel does not have its own car park, you have to leave your car at a distance of approx. 5 min . on foot. paid car park or (if you find a place) on the street (paid from Monday to Friday). You can unload your luggage in front of the hotel, as there is one place reserved for this purpose. Our room was rather tight, but somehow we were able to accommodate ourselves. There was an electric kettle - plus for that. The rooms are located on four floors, but the hotel does not have a lift. It was a nuisance to carry luggage down the winding stairs. Breakfast is ok (cottage cheese, cheese, steams, scrambled eggs to order (we did not try), mozzarella with tomatoes, toast bread + toaster, water, apple juice and orange juice, milk, probably flakes or muesli, I do not remember any more). ...coffee's rather weak. The room where breakfast was served was cold. The service was very nice."
5907,"We were having dinner with a family living in the area, who recommended this place to us. Despite a fairly high occupancy rate (8 March), the service ran quickly, smoothly and without interruption. The waitresses were very nice, smiling, responding lively to our requests. Kitchen without fireworks, but very correct and tasty. Tartar served classically, without any complaints. Pork knuckle - a huge portion - as for a small farmer, but apparently such are local needs. Generally, we liked everything and we came out very full. The only downside that is worth describing is the lack of any dry wine. There is no choice but ""house wine"" and unfortunately it is semi-sweet. Unfortunately the white wine was also given warm, but the staff at our request quickly delivered us a cooler with ice."
5908,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND! ! ! Why is that? Everything is fine until the temperature outside is moderate, when it is warmer the router gets hot. The temperature may be alive, because you don't touch such devices, but in this case WI - FI starts to fail. After a 50 Mb / s cable and wirelessly 4Mb / s, or even 0, 8 Mb / s . . Basic option and not working . Updates ? Please forget . Support ? Favorite . Written 'em to different places to ZTE, no response, all emails dead, sold - forgotten.

5910,"""Therefore, the genes whose mutations are responsible for the occurrence of this disease are sought in order to diagnose it better and above all faster. So far more than 30 such genes have been known. In the course of my doctoral thesis I managed to identify as many as three new genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, with a total of 10 mutations. One of the genes I have described is included in the most comprehensive PCD diagnostic panel available in the United States since the beginning of this year. Soon such tests should also be available in Poland"", says the researcher. As she explains, it's about tests that consist of isolating DNA from the patient's blood and then looking for mutations in the genes contained in the panel. Analysts check if a person has a mutation in any of the 30 genes responsible for primary eyelash discoloration."
5911,"Hello. We bought in the wife a week-long holiday at the Pharaoh's hotel tempted by a good price all inclusive . Travel by car from the Polish 1700 kilometers .

5912,"Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the previous speakers. The hotel is a modern, glass building, the windows are rather dirty, but I'm not from the Sanitary Service, this is not the most important thing. Ithaca sends its clients there because the attractive price and five stars. And this is where everything is hidden. The hotel should not have them 5. The service wraps up like a vacation but the management leaves much to be desired. All inclusive is tightly controlled, in 14 days about 100 times I was asked about the room number so why the wristband? Wet floors in the restaurant do not wipe out but only mark a special information plate which eventually ends up in an accident. Unfortunately it was too far away and she didn't hear if the victim of the accident had to give the room number again. In the evening bar around 10 pm . At 00 o'clock the drinks were refused because of the lack of glass and so we were having drinks in 5 stars in plastic cups. At breakfast, the glass was already broken, unfortunately. The food . . . . . . . .from hunger did not die m, but there were days that only potatoes were edible, the rest remained on the plate almost untouched. Rooms with sea views are not for Ithaca clients unless the salt pays off. TV is worse, because there is no Polish channel even for an extra charge. WI - FI only at the reception desk and very weak, but heavily besieged. It was not my first stay in Paphos, but in this hotel I did not want to be punished. I would advise against it and encourage you to use other hotels."
5913,"She hasn't had that kind of crap yet. The battery heats up . . . until it burns through the casing . . . At that time, the phone is dead. Only after the battery is discharged can I turn on the charging . She already gave me a complaint once and I give it back tomorrow . Previously, the service updated the software and was supposed to help, unfortunately it did not help . The phone answered me in August, now it's October and I've already had twice a problem with the battery. Little that the service has discovered that the back panel is going away. I understand that the phone is not tight as it says in the description. Fortunately, it didn't occur to me to take pictures underwater. To sum up, I got a BUBEL."
5914,"We used to spend Christmas there with our families. . Great. . . . . .it's so short. . .) Attractions for children - a very large playground, Santa Claus, who gave presents to children. . You can also leave your child under paid care and go for a fragrant massage ; ) delicious Christmas food - not to be eaten - fish, salads, salads, salads, salads, dumplings hmmm, yum! Even my mom, who is a professional cook, praised her, so she must be really great! Clean rooms, nice and helpful staff - without a forced smile, as it sometimes happens. And the pool of course: ) Aha! an amazing attraction for us was roasting wild boar and mulled wine, pride - and all this in a package! And also the disco in the night club downstairs, or drinks in the bar at the reception from the professional bartenders: D I hope that so far nothing has changed there [ at least for the worse ; ] because she wanted me to come back there, because she spent this time in a great way and really rested me: ) ) I recommend it ! !"
5915,"Unfortunately, in my case it was similar to that of most of our predecessors. : / And it's a pity, because Mr. Maciej is a nice man. Unfortunately, I was also drawn to a number of different studies, which as it turned out were unnecessary. He also conducted a procedure under general anaesthesia (sic !), which was also not necessary ! I will never see Mr. Maciej again. And I would also advise against it, ladies and gentlemen. P . S . I was also encouraged by a paid control examination (e.g. after the procedure). And so it was with Mr. Lewandowski ."
5918,"Course : German A 2 / E bdb [ / b ] The woman is incredibly nice. When you want to learn something from her - no problem (but you actually have to show your own willingness, because there is no compulsion). No cards, just a lot of homework, but you can have 5 of them missing, so. . . . Checking colloquium - not too difficult, it was enough to look a little bit at the notes (a lot of vocabulary) . The atmosphere in class is great, as for me - it is definitely an encouragement to learn :) Examination A 2 passed the exam at 4, so as you can see, it's not bad : ) I highly recommend it ! ! !"
5919,"I don't recommend this place. When it comes to accommodation in the manor house, this place is clean and tidy. As for the castle, the hotel staff is unpleasant and offended that they have to work. The waiter at dinner was not nice . He also passed the blend in with us with other clients . He forgot to order them. The food is not good. Only the pancake with cheese was tasty, but you can't spoil it. The same waiter served at the party the other day. He was offended again. The food served was cold. The staff after the party claimed that nothing happened even though there were complaints from guests."
5920,"Tomasz Siwek explained to PAP that since there is no biological marker that would indicate the disease's severity, doctors assess the effects of treatment, e.g. sometimes patients' survival and their ability to breathe on their own, without the help of medical devices. ""Independent ventilation is a factor which determines the quality of life of patients in a significant way"" - said the doctor. He added that in SLA the progress of the disease"" is linear, which means that the patient's condition deteriorates at a constant pace. ""The finding that some factor, in this case the administration of stem cells, modifies the course of this disease in such a way that it slows down its course, shows the effectiveness of the influence of this element"" - explained Siwek. Money for research on the use of stem cells in SLA patients has been granted to Olsztyn's doctors by the National Centre for Research and Development."
5921,"The access to the castle itself is intuitively simple. The hotel from the outside makes an impressive impression of the old castle, but already the reception desk dispels the anxiety that inside you can find cobwebs, draughts and cold brick cells. Krasicki's decor is a very sophisticated combination of modernity and tradition. Functionally decorated interiors do not lose their historical and historic character. Rooms are spacious with stylized furniture, but bathrooms are as modern as possible. The swimming pool complex does not knock on the huge, but is moody and intimate. The SPA did not use em so I will not say a word. The kitchen is on a good level and doesn't get on your knees, but I admit that during the conference, the quality always doesn't keep up with the quantity needed hence maybe my lack of admiration. One remark - if they offer you a room in the clock tower, throw yourself like Rejtan under the reception desk and don't let yourself in there, because although the rooms are beautiful, it's a horse with a row of who will be able to find his way there even the second time."
5922,"The hotel is terribly located. No communication in close proximity. You really had to bother! ! ! To get to the airport, you still have to get down to the city and go to the airport. Do not believe that the hotel is close to the airport. We got a room with a ""view"" of the dumpster and the roof of some economic part of the hotel. It was terrible! ! In the morning there was a lot of noise (probably deliveries). They tried to replace us because we were supposed to spend 4 days there. A young receptionist promised us a change to the upper floor. After coming back from the city, we were supposed to move but . . . . .the word was not kept. We were tired of being there for 4 days. The room was very tiny and worn out. The bathroom was terrible. Breakfast is pretty decent, but there's no craze. But dinner was no longer credible! ! ! I'll say yes - do not use the hotel restaurant! ! ! ! ! ! ! There was a so called salad buffet, very modest because it consisted of: peas, beans, bread and something not yet worth remembering. We thought we could take it as part of an ordered dinner because there were no extras to the dish. It turned out that we were added 8 euros! No information! The whole dinner was 59 euros and it was really terrible. I honestly do not recommend this facility."
5923,"The castle is nice, but the hotel is a tragedy. I had the night in the wing of the former coach house. The walls were thin as canvas of a tent. A shower from the adjacent room can be heard as if someone was bathing by my bed. The door to the room with gaps of a few centimeters. From the corridor you could still hear screams, calls, loud conversations, suitcases rolling and music. The staff from the reception did not react. The linen was patched and still with holes. Breakfast was served in a room with huge tables, perhaps a remnant of the previous day's wedding (just like napkins and tablecloths), hence the need to sit down like in a milk bar during communion. After one sleepless night, we were relieved to leave the village."
5924,"I would like to recommend Mrs. Magda as a reliable, empathetic, understanding and patient and very competent, wise and experienced psychologist. Mrs. Magda listens to me carefully, helps to look at the problem from the other side, her comments are very valuable and accurate. Thanks to this, I can raise difficult issues for me. After each visit, I come back encouraged and full of hope. She realizes that I still have a lot of work ahead of me. Visits to Mrs. Magda's have taught me that you can make a mistake or not persevere in your decisions, but it is worth trying again to fight for yourself and good relations with your surroundings. I highly recommend Mrs. Magda to everyone who needs the help of a reliable psychologist. Monika"
5925,"It has been decided that this time the cross-transplantation will take place in two cities, and not so far - all operations in Warsaw. Earlier, in 2015 in the capital city, a cross-transplantation was performed in two couples in which men wanted to donate a kidney to their partners, but could not do it because of an incompatible blood group or a cross-test which showed that it was not possible to perform a transplant between them. Prof . Kwiatkowski said that both kidney transplantations in Warsaw and Szczecin were successful. ""In both recipients, a woman and a man, renal parameters are normalised,"" he assured. The donor from Lublin, from whom a kidney was taken in Warsaw, is to leave the hospital on Friday and his wife, who received a kidney from a woman from Szczecin, is to leave the hospital this Monday at the latest."
5926,"My skin looks worse after the doctor's treatment than when I came to it. Still trying to get axotrex that I'm not going to take. I'm changing doctors, I hope someone else knows more effective methods, drugs than one. It's a pity that despite years of struggle, coming to see the doctor didn't get my help. Not always being nice and competent goes hand in hand. Now I just don't know how to cure the consequences of this ignorance."
5927,"It's been a long time since you've seen 'em. Not very clean, the furniture was scratched, the tap in the sink with two cocks, of which the one with cold water did not work. Location on a two-lane street. Unguarded parking. Breakfast very average . First and last time . . . ."
5928,"I am at the Vila Gale Hotel and I can only say that this place has no weaknesses. Excellent service, excellent food, standard of comfort. I recommend this place to everyone. Every day I am surprised by the culture, vocabulary and tact of the people working here. The nearby airport is an attraction rather than a nuisance because airplanes fly very little. My best holiday, I come back here next year. The hotel is very well connected to the rest of the island."
5929,"A really great instructor, first of all he teaches mathematics at the right pace and explains well. He actually treats women with exceptional courtesy and humour, but he has a rule - if someone often runs to the blackboard, he will pull up the grade at the end of the classes (when passing in colloquia). So girls should become immune to sometimes rude texts, because in the end it will pay off. Colloquia is not too difficult if you are learning. Generally - extra ! PS . The above opinion applies to Analysis, because the lecture from Algebra was the last one on Wednesday and late November . . . you understand . . ."
5930,"Hotel located near the center of Wroclaw . Room and bathroom clean, cosmetics ok, maybe a little bed too soft but not bad. Breakfast pretty good. Parking is additionally paid 25 PLN. On a very big plus I wanted to evaluate the service. At the reception all efficiently and with a smile. However, during breakfast one of the waitresses surprised me very positively. Very quickly organized a table for 8 people, immediately reported the baby feeding chair, asked the children how they liked Wroclaw, and so on. At one point my 7 year old daughter asked if there is ketchup on what you smile: sure it is, I'm going to bring it to you. A few words and gestures and it is impressive."

On the second day, em was operated on at the John Paul II Hospital in Łódź and a stoma was found. After five months in the same hospital, the gastrointestinal tract was restored, but the skin and intestinal fistula followed. After four months in the Weternow Hospital at 1 Hallera Street, Dr. Bishop of Lodz was operated on by Dr. Bishop of Lodz. Jarosław Cywiński and the gastrointestinal tract continuity was restored. I am now almost four months after successful surgery. Dr. Cywiński before and after the operation he took care of me and performed colonoscopy and rectroscopy and also ordered a CT scan of the intestines. I highly appreciate his professionalism and contact with the patient."
5932,"In the early versions of the apparatus, measurements were carried out at a flow velocity of only 0,05 millilitre per minute. One analysis required 40 minutes, and the result was affected by an error of up to 30%. Nowadays, the flow velocity is twenty times higher, the test takes three minutes and the accuracy of measurements has increased more than five times. Shortening the analysis time is important - determining the optimal drug dose requires not one but three measurements. ""First we have to introduce the drug molecule into the capillary and determine their diffusion rate. Then we measure the diffusion of the protein with which the drug is to bind, for example albumin. In the third measurement we inject the drug and the protein it interacts with into the capillary filled with the same protein. It is only by comparing the results that we can determine how efficiently the drug will bind to the protein in the patient's blood,"" explains doctoral student Aldona Majcher."

Maybe she is outstanding in the removal of nevi, but she does not know the pharmacological treatment, and to this she behaves as if she has eaten all her brains. She could also pay more attention to the interest of the patient and the problem that comes with it. This lady wouldn't even look at my face to assess the problem. She overdid her prescription and invited her to a consultation in 3 weeks. The cost of a 3-minute visit is 120 PLN. She tried to ask questions about the apropo's use of the medicines I get and the home care I get but apparently my time is up because the answers were very oily or not at all. Very unpleasant impressions, certainly not worth the price. Of course, I also got a referral to a gynecologist friend, who referred me to her gynecologist friend. . . . .circus."

The hotel itself old and stinking steak. Eating at breakfast is bad. . . As if everything was covered with one stinking rubbish in the kitchen. . I don't know, but everything had the same strange taste. We came with a child of 10 months, she was supposed to be quiet and peaceful, and by 10 p.m. she ran and screamed the children from the colony, and she was lying and screaming on our balcony, because we had a room on the ground floor. Luckily it was only two nights. I don't recommend this hotel."
5937,"This is a hotel which I come to with great pleasure despite the hardships of business trips. I am looking forward to staying there. I make my business meetings dependent on the availability of accommodation because I don't want to go anywhere else (she stayed for 6 years in all the hotels in the city and its surroundings...) . A well-deserved thousand stars. The room has everything (and even more) you need. . . . . .the neighborhood is pampered. . . Spacious car park . Very high level of service . Possibility of spending time actively in the vicinity of the lake, out of town .

The question of rooms - Quite a lot, but the dirt amazing enough to move the doormat at the entrance to the bathroom dirt as hell! Bathroom cleanliness? Just pick up the brush to the toilet and see the unusual brown color. Glasses in the room without comment . As for the food, you could choose something but the quality of the food is another fairy tale - unsuccessful joke, mockery of guests, just like the drinks the choice is not the worst and that's it. The only thing that is drunk is a beer-like beverage. In the pool, ice water. The shit and grave around the pool. Neutral service, skip the theft of BGN 20 from the wallet of the room while not present. My personal evaluation is not recommended! ! !"
5941,"We spent 4 days in this hotel with one child, / winter holidays / . We will remember them as ""some kind of nightmare"". Nobody from the staff is interested in guests, they are left to themselves, the standard of rooms is very different, cold water in the shower, at the pool, paddling pool in a mourning state. . . . can be exchanged and replaced, as the defect chases the defect. The corridors are dirty, carpets have not seen a vacuum cleaner, the staff passing by pretend not to see them. Breakfast is not very diversified, lunches are not very much, monotonous, coffee ""aro"" in cups, still cheesecake, coconut and for breakfast yeast other cakes do not know.

5943,"The biggest advantage of the hotel is its location between the rocks and therefore the diversity of the surroundings connected by bridges, passages, paths, super view, in this integrated oblong bay closed by rocks beautiful place for floating. A magnificent 2 pools with sea water and an ark separating them from the sea. Food is good, rooms with a kitchenette, something Greek style, located on a slope. Of course, an extra trip to Santorini is a great attraction. The biggest advantage is certainly a rare location."

That is why it is worth to work not only on procedures, but also on appropriate professional habits - a positive work routine. It will protect us from unwanted, accidental accidents. We should remember that our distraction may be used against third parties in order to provide them with confidential information. Very important issue . The fact that someone agrees to our request to lend an image or use his or her visit for promotional purposes does not change the fact that we have violated a certain limit of this privacy. Such a request is itself such a request. People - especially well educated"
5945,"It seems nice and competent - but it's just an envelope and a sham. He watched thumbnails because he didn't even know how to increase them - he claimed that this is the best view. When he asked 'em specific questions, he was disposing of 'em - of course, everything in a very nice way - when he insisted on more specific answers, there was a so called ""pouring of water"" and a change of subject. According to this doctor there are certain treatment protocols that MUST help in any situation and if the patient is still sick it means that he is pretending and there is no other explanation because it MUST HELP. He hasn't helped me personally, but the other way around."
5946,"As he explains, the dosage of oncological drugs depends on the patient's body weight. In case of a drug, the average dose is 150 mg per day. There are 30 tablets in the package and each tablet contains 25 mg of the drug. One such package is sufficient for 5 days, costs 2 thousand PLN and is reimbursed to patients. If the patent on the original medicine expires and the generic medicine can be introduced to the market, usually the price drops by 30 - 40 percent. The price is also determined by the rules of the market game between companies that develop their own generics. ""There are few oncological drugs produced in Poland. The vast majority of them are imported to Poland, which is why the National Centre for Research and Development (NCRD) has decided to co-finance the development of a Polish equivalent of a drug used in lung cancer. In the past, it happened that there was a shortage of oncological drugs for Polish patients, because the companies preferred to place their products on those markets where they received higher prices. Parallel import also takes away some of these medicines because they are cheap. Having Poland's own production of oncological drugs provides much better protection for citizens"" - believes Bednarczyk ."
5947,"Very good location of the hotel with convenient access and parking in the price of accommodation is a great advantage. However, you need to improve the access to the car park, because the entrance is from a side street and it is easy to bypass it. You can easily approach the center of the hotel on your feet and it will not tire anyone. There is also a station and public transport stops nearby, and if you want to get to the shopping centre, it is also close by. Right next door there are two 24-hour shops. The reception desk is spacious and with courteous and competent staff. The room is very clean and spacious (I note that I booked the better one with a shower and a large bed). The room has a kettle, tea, coffee and even thought of a sweetener. The fridge, however, was empty, so they did not foresee a bar for guests, except for mineral water. Central air conditioning with individual control. Comfortable, large bed. Bathroom with bath for some is an advantage for others a disadvantage. The hotel has a very mini gym and a dry sauna, but you have to take towels from the room. Breakfast is also available for those who have come to rest, because up to 11 a start from 6. 30 . Lots of dishes to choose from and constantly supplemented. The hotel has many guests including foreigners."
5948,"Parthenogenesis, or virginity, occurs in nature in many invertebrates such as skates, nematodes, mites, crustaceans or insects (e.g. bees, wasps, sticks, beetles). It is also observed among some vertebrates: reptiles (e.g. guanoes, geckos), amphibians (some frogs) or fish (e.g. some sharks or guppies). As far as mammals are concerned, there is no virginity in nature. ""But scientists already manage to achieve it in a laboratory environment. Thus, it is already possible to obtain embryos of young mammals with genetic material from two mothers or two fathers"" - says Katarzyna Klimczewska, a PhD student from the Embryology Department of the Faculty of Biology at the University of Warsaw, in an interview with PAP. The researcher says that over a decade ago Kaguya mouse was born, whose parents were two mothers. In order for the birth of this mouse to be possible, scientists had to know exactly what was happening in the fertilized cell, especially what genes were being expressed and when. It turns out that for the proper development of a human embryo it is necessary to have the presence of both male and female genomes simultaneously. The paternal gene is responsible for the early development of the placenta, while the maternal gene is responsible for the development of the embryo. The lack of genes from the father leads to abnormal development of the placenta and death of the embryo. In turn, the lack of genes from the mother causes the development of the embryo to be delayed and ends in death. However, scientists have managed to circumvent this problem by means of genetic modifications. For parthenogenetic embryos to develop, one of the two maternal genomes had to have epigenetic modifications specific to the paternal genome. Thanks to such a mechanism, embryos deprived of the father's genetic material could develop."
5949,"Tragedy . We went on a last-minute holiday with our fiancé. They went to TUI, the lady recommended us the Turtle Beach Hotel. We didn't think that a trusted office would send guests to such places! We've been going with them for years so the surprise was huge. We arrived in Zakynthos around 6am, the hotel day starts at 2pm, and we were ready to wait for the room until that hour. The receptionist 'went to our hand' and offered accommodation almost immediately. Unfortunately the positive aspects of the hotel ended there. The room was terrible, the window was opening up to the viewing dining room - an amazing stench, not to mention the hotel guests eating before our eyes. At the entrance of the fly stickler - it wasn't mentioned probably since the beginning of the hotel. The bathrooms are not even commenting on the tragedy (a window covered with cardboard, mushrooms everywhere, unfurnished tiles); the bedroom furniture is exactly as if someone threw it away and the staff took it to the hotel and built it into the decor. The lady at the reception (such a ore, older) very unpleasant when they asked us to change the room got very upset. We had to wait by the luggage (they don't have a separate room where they can be stored) until 2 p.m. to assign a new room while other people, newcomers, got the rooms right away before our eyes. For the first time we had something like that, to turn on the air conditioning (20 euro deposit), we had to ""bury"" the fuses - we got a separate fuse to put in the fuse box from the whole room. The hotel consists of several buildings, which one is worse. The best ( BUILDING C ) is probably reserved for guests not - from - Polish - rooms are free ( you can see barricaded windows from the pool ) and still Poles are not assigned. Now the question of food - worse impression than destroyed rooms. All week long one meat and one fish, raw vegetables and the only edible dish - chips. The beach - . . . . It was supposed to be, unfortunately, 1m of sand taken over by algae can't count. The island itself is wonderful. Clean swimming pools . But for the pools themselves, I don't think it's worth breaking into this hotel that far. If you're looking for a nice, romantic vacation and relaxation it's NOT HERE: )"
5950,"The idea of creating the facility involves - together with the Military Medical Institute - the Association of Ujazdowski Hospital, which initiated the establishment of the Museum of the Military Hospital in Ujazdów - the largest and oldest Polish military hospital. The amount of funds that can be raised will determine whether and when and on what scale the project will be implemented. ""Many years ago, when the Military Medical Institute was being established, it was said that it inherited the traditions of the Sanitary Training Centre (CWS) operating in Warsaw at Ujazdowski Hospital; it was a cadet school where future military doctors were educated"" - indicated the director of WIM, Gen. Grzegorz Gielerak ."
5951,"It was the first time that I met the Doctor in an oncology clinic among a crowd of people - which did not prevent him from maintaining his culture and professionalism and calm. He looked at it from the side (he was with his wife) so he could judge it more objectively. Since I am already a guy with a distant PESEL, cyclical visits to the urologist are a must. So I went to see the doctor privately for a check . I was accepted as an old friend, and it was em first time. After the examination, I got em a complete diagnosis and a lot of information "" about "" that were new to me. It's strange after many visits to other urologists, but it's true. My wife's doctor has already helped my wife, I hope he's eliminated the problem irrevocably. It all points to that. I'm sure I'll certainly take advantage of the possibilities the Doctor offers. I sincerely recommend it and admit 5 stars (deserves 6 or more)."
5952,"I do not hide that Mrs. Ptaszynska pulled me out of a very difficult life situation, but when at the last appointment, which was supposed to finally assess my mental state, which she described earlier as good and stable, Mrs. Ptaszynska took with her a person close to me to look at it with her eye. As soon as the doctor saw that I was accompanied by a ""controller"" she seemed to feel confused. Not long ago, thinking I was cured, she wanted to make an appointment with me for a last check-up visit. On this visit she changed her mind completely, saying that : ""I've still got a long therapy with a psychologist and a long term contraction of antidepressants."" Our meeting ended after half an hour because the doctor ran out of ideas for telling me depression. I'll add that 90% of the visits were non-customized. Now, instead of always following me, I feel anger at the fact that nowadays, even doctors from such serious diseases as deep depression have got overwhelmed with greed and egoism. . . The situation with the psychologist was ""collegially"" identical. I leave this depressing opinion as a warning to the sick to beware of the interested doctors who once took the oath of Hippocrates to help those in need and promised: ""I will use treatments to the best of my ability and ability for the benefit of the sick, defending them from harm and harm. ""I warn you, Embarrassed."
5953,"Let's start with the staff, who were rude if they asked us to change empty water jugs during the conference or to have a glass of water for lunch there was a problem and a grimace on the staff's face. . . On the second day, the same thing is true for the rooms, the standard resembles the PKP Half-Colony in Pscim Dolny and not the brand which is Novotel. Personally I will never go there again: )"
5954,"A very kind, warm man. He made me sclerotherapy on quite large varicose veins, the effect lasted 2 years, after which small veins started to appear, with which I also go to doctor. Perhaps someone will say that it's relatively short but the varicose veins can't be disposed of once and for all. I will add that earlier I had sclerotherapy done in Warsaw, where the effect was poor (a few months) + soul cost visits + commuting to Warsaw. According to me it is a very good specialist who is trying to make the patient happy with the effect."
5955,"Hello all ladies and girls who are going to go to this doctor and I WARNING because the doctor is inventing a disease . I was in my third pregnancy and I got to your doctor by order of my friend who worked with him and unfortunately after the first visit I was already broken down because the doctor after the interview (she said that I am at risk because my mother and grandmother died of cancer) and then after the examination he found out that I have a very large erosion that can turn into cervical cancer and set the next visit on Saturday paid 200 PLN and that I will have a colposcopy. I was shaken under the office and during the examination the doctor showed me on the monitor what size this erosion is and what are the consequences of its negligence (not to mention that she did not pay me in the registration only to the doctor in the office). He also appointed another paid visit and also for a colposcopy. She was 28 years old and had two healthy kids at home and after this visit my world collapsed. She thought how I would say this to my husband, but she was unnecessarily afraid because my husband was more realistic about the whole thing than I was and he didn't let a bad thought get to him but he asked me to go somewhere else and consult with him. It was good that this happened because another doctor did not confirm your diagnosis and calmed down . She gave birth to a healthy girl in the Esculapus and there the Doctor during visits before the birth and after the birth did not confirm the diagnosis of your doctor ."
5956,"The hostel is close to the metro station, access to the Old Town is 2 / 3 stops, one kilometer from the hostel is Kaufland, the area is quite pleasant. The price is low. When it comes to quality - a typical dorm: one toilet and one shower per floor, the kitchen is not really a good place to use it because there is nothing there and nothing works, not very clean, the door is thin - you can hear everything from the corridor and the adjacent rooms."
5957,"A good supplement to the diet are seasonal vegetables and fruits. As prof . Kardas, some of them, such as cucumber or watermelon, consist mostly of water, so they are ideal for consumption in summer. As he said, vegetables and fruits have a medium amount of protein and small amount of carbohydrates. ""Then, when it's hot, our caloric requirement is small,"" he said. As one of the best dishes during the heat, he pointed out the caprese salad, which consists of tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. And what about the movement during the heat? In the expert's opinion, it is best to leave the house early in the morning or in the evening, and between 10. 00 a 18 . 00 stay in the house . In the middle of the day it is worth to close the windows and do not let in hot air; you can also cover the windows - then the hot rays of the sun will not reach the room."
5958,"Mr. Tomasz operated on my broken femur as a result of a bicycle accident. Zero gypsum, I have a titanium nail in my leg, so after a few days I was able to move on my own about the bullets, after a few weeks I move quite smoothly for the seriousness of my injury, although still with the belay of the bullets . I am very pleased with Mr. Doctor's work, despite his young age I have the impression that he is a professional in every way, he has an excellent approach to every patient and he has witnessed his work with both young children and the elderly."
5959,"Bass as a tako can do it, but unfortunately with its quite resilient sound you can't hear any music. You can't hear them almost completely. . . sound flat as a wall ! If somebody has a rubber ear, they may like it, but as he wrote 'em above, the speakers sound better than a computer. No space! No sound selectivity! there is a sound stain coming out of the speakers, nothing else . . . I strongly advise against"
5960,"There are a few downsides, but overall our stay is evaluated very well. First of all, a very tasty and nicely served breakfast and many attractions. The spa would have to be renovated a little bit, but the other attractions are as good as possible - and most importantly - in the price of the stay. Nice service at the reception, nice view of the lake from the window. . . . .in summer it's probably even nicer: ) We got a quite spacious room with a large and comfortable bed on a double mattress (also comfortable). Positively surprises also the ice rink, rather rare in hotels. Overall, the price to quality ratio is very good."
5961,"The product did not meet my expectations both in terms of performance (protruding elements that did not fit into the drawer - an employee from the shop informed me that such a defect is present in all products of this company) as well as its functionality. Indeed, it is possible to make fries using a very small amount of fat, but they are flabby and do not resemble real fries. They also do not taste great. I also tried to make pork chips in it. { The pan is dry as a chip and in nothing resembles a real juicy Polish pork chop,"
5963,"It was our second stay in this hotel. A year ago, we were in the middle of the resort and the problem was a long and cold, temporary corridor leading to the SPA area. We were accommodated in the hotel part and due to the distance, it was terribly inconvenient. Of course, no one informed us about these difficulties before arrival. This time the stay was also unsuccessful. On the first night, the problem was that the hotel had a prom, which, given the location of our room, was very burdensome. We could hear the music and the rumbling bass would not let us sleep. Instead of relaxing, we had a sleepless night. As a compensation, the hotel prepared massages and offered a bottle of wine from the Casa Botaneros house of the Valdepeñas Tempranillo-Shiraz tribe, which is imported by a company from Koszalin, which is located near the hotel. It should be noted that this was certainly a nice gesture, but if all massages look like ours (according to the price list 90 zł for 30 minutes), we sincerely advise against buying them. This has nothing to do with a professional 5-star hotel massage. The next day, a very big discomfort was the limited operation of the wellness area (the dry sauna and both Jacuzzis did not work all day). With a longer stay of one day, a failure may not be a problem, but with a short stay (2 days), it is a big drawback. There is no information about when and if the failure will be removed at all and what alternative the hotel offers. Additionally, on the first day, not all the towels were available because, according to the cleaning service, they did not come back from the laundry. They were added on the second day. Other disadvantages include the lack of a shower handle on the inside, the lighting above the mirror not working and the need to reset the wi - fi router frequently. Many Ukrainians among the hotel staff. There was no live cooking. Pistoning at breakfasts . It is hard to decide once again to stay at the Diune Hotel, from a 5-star hotel you should expect a lot, much more. We advise against it."
5964,"Specially. If you want to talk, you have to go outside. Kombornia Manor proved to be ideal for creating a comfortable enclave of relaxation, peace and quiet. In addition, the park, walk, bike, football pitch, beach volleyball - a classic. Tennis court? There is no tennis court. Why? There are tennis courts everywhere and we have beach volleyball. What else? The Carpathian wine lounge. We have a collection of wines from the Carpathian Mountains, i.e. Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Czech Republic and Hungary."
5965,"Hello, I sincerely recommend the Doctor to other patients! As the only one of many gynaecologists to whom I attended visits both within the National Health Fund and privately, he did not underestimate my problem and wrote a referral to the appropriate clinic. Thanks to that, today I am after an appropriate procedure and, what is most important, I am healthy: ) During the visit, we have maintained full professionalism, reliable answers to the questions asked, sincere desire to help and useful advice. Additionally, Mr. Doctor encourages you to share your doubts and is willing to dispel them to the best of your ability and knowledge. I am very pleased with today's visit, I felt ""taken care of"". - I think this is a very important feature in the patient-doctor relationship. Greetings."
5966,"The hotel is really impressive, not only because of its location on the beach itself or its attractive appearance, but above all because of the cosiness and comfort it offers. They visited the ""Zdrojowy"" for the second time, this time in the off-season and it was a great success. The rooms are clean, comfortable, well-thought-out and clean. Breakfast is delicious, every day various dishes and ingredients are available only of the best quality. Free access to the pool or sauna is a great attraction for children and adults, especially in low season. Likewise, the playroom with cool babysitters, the kids did not want to leave it: ) . We also had a free access to the room with exercise equipment, ping-pong table, billiards and table football. Everything was well thought-out, comfortable, well equipped and high quality equipment. If I wanted to complain, I would mention the water temperature in the pool, if it was enough for adults, but for children it could be 2 - 3 degrees higher. It would also be useful for the elevator to go a little closer to the entrance to the pool, now we are forced to either go down the staircase, or going by the elevator to go past the exit to the outside, which after bathing is not quite nice. The atmosphere in the rooms themselves sometimes requires either opening the window or switching on the air supply, because with the windows tightly closed and without air supply it can sometimes seem stuffy. But these are small things that did not make a very good impression on us and did not affect the overall impression. We will definitely come back: )"
5967,"But to those who offer rooms in Wroclaw every day for 200 zloty (50 euro) and for the duration of the championship offer them for 1200 zloty (300 euro) I can tell you the total flapper of such an idea and interesting comments of Internet users on booking portals with the possibility of posting comments "" . In the November issue of "" Hotel Management "" Jacek Piast advises hoteliers "" How to prepare a price offer for the upcoming holidays of 2012 ? "" How ? "" It is good to see the location of the facility. Check how long it takes to get to the nearest city - the organizer and what quality of the road? If there is a chance for tourists from Europe - prepare an up-to-date website in English, and preferably in the language of the country of the representation, which will play in our nearest city."
5968,"I choose the Novotel Warszawa Centrum Hotel because of its location. It is a hotel in the very centre of Warsaw with a view of the Palace of Culture and business centre on one side, the National Stadium and the western part of Warsaw on the other. As the main advantages of this hotel I would point out that it is a good place to stay: - very good location - very good conditions, including a sauna with a great view of the city - free vouchers for a welcome drink (for holders of Accorhotels card - silver minimum) - invitations to artistic eveningsBreakfast at the hotel is tasty, but in my opinion too little variety. The rooms are neat and clean. Minuses of the hotel: - very large number of guests, which makes it sometimes difficult to feel the atmosphere of rest there (it happened to me that a group of guests did not respect the night's silence and behaved loudly in the corridor). - parking lot outside the hotel (in the building next door) - which makes it necessary to carry luggage in an inconvenient way. To sum up, I recommend this hotel mainly because of its great location."
5969,"The Doctor explained in a factual way what the treatment will consist in (chronic acne in an adult), told about possible side effects of the treatment and answered questions concerning all my doubts (Izotek therapy); additionally, the Doctor is a very nice person; I hope that the effects of the treatment will be as positive as the course of the visit: )"
5971,"She's a very nice lab girl, although it's true that she doesn't know about some exercises but that's because she's just starting to teach. She's generally forgiving about the reports, and as far as I'm concerned, she's very lenient. Without much emphasis (although you have to understand the subject) she can be ranked at 5.0: )"
5972,"A very good hotel both in business and in private. Rooms with balconies with a nice view of the hills. Warm swimming pool with terrace on the south side - great relaxation . In addition, delicious meals . After we were a group, the food in the heaters was not dry and tasteless, which often happens in group service. Really tasty. There was a nightclub, a bowling alley and billiards. There's what to do and in worse weather. I'll probably go back there. The only drawback is 3 km to the spa park."
5973,"""If we want to predict a process, it would be good to know what its history was,"" says Dr. Rafał Mostowy, a scientist working at the Imperial College of London. ""If we can understand exactly how this process has developed over millions of years, we can guess what it will look like in the future,"" he adds. Dr. Mostowy is carrying out research to explain how the recombination of DNA can affect the rapid immunization of pneumococci to vaccines. Pneumococci, the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, are the main cause of pneumonia, but they also cause meningitis and ear infections. The World Health Organization estimates that up to one million children under the age of five can die each year from diseases caused by this pathogen."
5974,"The hotel as such but the food is breakfast every day the same, lunch is hot 5 kinds And it's actually not know what to connect with, dinner is just as bad a choice well that there's a pitzernacle in the middle of it is a pitzernacle you can buy food so miserable a food is not so bad a food I've never seen the lack of air conditioning on the stool, the rooms are nowhere to be found. Desserts are some jellies, baked goods are baguettes and boilies nothing else. Really one big tragedy I have not seen so much, the pool about but at 7 in the morning you have to get up to have an umbrella because the amount is limited, the bed at 9 release and again I fight again, the only plus is the drinks and alcohol it is ok, the internet 25 euros tydxien and free 30 minutes a day in the lobby, far away from here everywhere the hotel should change the attitude a little bit to the angle because it's that people pizza that's great it's probably never anywhere had better conditions for me it's less than zero I do not recommend."
5975,"She was hoping to see this doctor. I have one child, she wanted me to have another but unfortunately she miscarried me twice and now I cannot get pregnant. First of all, the professor argued with me that it was not a miscarriage but a biochemical pregnancy because there was no ultrasound with the heart rate. What's the difference, the problem is why these pregnancies did not develop further. He must have wanted to see the records from the hospital when I went after the miscarriage. She felt like she was undermining my miscarriages at all. He did an ultrasound, but he didn't even ask when she had my last period or on what day of my cycle! ! ! Then he said that I have adenomycosis but it has no effect on my pregnancy. I was stressed out when I read about it, especially because Dr. Bardzosie was underestimating it. In general, I had the impression that he was tired and bored. He gave me a referral for some tests, but in total she didn't find out anything. He stated that she should leave with her husband for a long vacation because that's why I have a problem with getting pregnant. It was my first visit to this doctor and I don't know if it's not the last one."
5977,"Head of the team of neurologists and neurosurgeons prof . Wojciech Maksymowicz together with neurologist prof . Adam Czapliński ( he works in Zurich every day ) announced the results of research of Olsztyn scientists during the international neurological symposium held on Friday in Olsztyn . The doctors informed that their team has the results of 11 patients with atrophic lateral sclerosis who were given stem cells. All patients, according to the standards of this kind of examinations, were observed for the next 6 months in terms of the disease progress. It turned out that in 7 of them the progression of the disease was significantly slowed down. In the case of 4 people there was no improvement i.e. the disease progressed at the same rate as before the administration of the stem cells. Professor Maksymowicz's team is the first in the country to announce such results and the results achieved are comparable to those obtained by scientists dealing with SLA stem cell treatment in Italy, Israel or the USA. In those countries, trials were conducted on a similar number of patients. The results of the Polish scientists announced on Friday caused a wide discussion, their colleagues from all over the world asked, among other things, about the ways of treating patients or informing them about the possibility of stem cell treatment."
5978,"For a psychiatrist, it's extremely calm. I don't think he's been given anything by patients for many years. He knows what it's about when you talk to him. It's strange that a man can listen. He appreciates the patient and his time, because he dates a certain time and he warns us about it. He consults the patient on the ordered drugs. At first she doubted his knowledge, but then she was the only one who wasn't afraid to tell me which medications were harmful to me. Others are offended when their medication doesn't suit me. Generally - positive ."
5979,"Unfortunately, I confirm - when it comes to the visit to the NFZ - it leaves much to be desired! ! ! ! I had thyroid problems for several years, during my pregnancy I was referred to a specialist for prophylactic purposes. The first visit (1.5 hours late, but what's up, patients from the National Health Fund can wait for themselves) lasted 5 minutes, w/ w looked and wrote a referral for examination. The second visit (traditionally 1.5 hrs late, where all waiting patients are pregnant). - with results, norms exceeded, bach, no discussion of any reflection, only a prescription for Eutyrox. And so on. A total revival of visits! ! ! ! ! I'll add that I've been treated by several endocrinology specialists, and an interview in such cases is essential! ! ! But where there is, not for NFZ patients. I will only add that I was referred to a doctor in the hospital where I had my own gynaecologist - Madurowicz Hospital. She walked with me within the NFZ because I was so comfortable. However, after the birth I will be treated privately. I read opinions about the great approach of this d r, but it certainly concerned private patients, because I was treated as if I was at least transparent, and certainly a second class patient! ! ! !"
5980,"No words to describe this shit, the pictures speak for themselves. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone. The rooms are dirty, the bathroom is mold and fungus, the decor is typical for the kitsch of the 90s, the food is also not the first freshness."
5981,"Many of my friends warned me that after his visits they were crying, but since only to him was on a free date, and it turned out that I was pregnant so I registered m . Waiting in front of his office came out the patient also with a cry. When she came into the office she told me that I had a positive pregnancy test, for this the doctor said that the pregnancy is still too early to say anything, so he didn't even examine me. When she asked for some certificate to work so that I could be relieved, he replied that it was some kind of whimsy. When I got to him after about 2 weeks again, with very heavy bleeding, he saved me 3 packs of duphaston (I don't know why, when it was long after the pregnancy) and told me to lie down. I won't say what I experienced at that moment, only a woman who lost a child can understand. I'm surprised that this doctor works at Luxmed. I wouldn't recommend it. He totally pissed me off, and when there was nothing to save, I think he got scared and unnecessarily dragged me to the cost. Not only that very not competent but also very unpleasant. I DEFINITELY DON'T RECOMMEND IT EVER AGAIN."
5982,"We went with our friends to London for the weekend to watch the NFL International Series. They decided that we would stay overnight at Acacia Hostel. It was a mistake. Unfortunately we were given a room that hadn't been cleaned in ages. Dirty beds, tons of dust on the floor and ""wardrobes."" The beds and bed linen had a strange musty smell. On the walls of course mold and moisture. They were too scared to sleep in this bed, so after bathing they slept in a tracksuit. . . . As for the bathroom, one of its advantages was that it had hot water. The showers of the washbasin and the toilets were scandalously dirty, with all the shit and mold. I don't recommend it to anyone. Breakfast is toast and jam. Wifi doesn't work, sometimes in the hallway but it's rare."
5983,"I lived in a single room, from the street. The noise from the street is terrible. Even with the window closed ( leaks ) . The constant stench of sewage in the bathroom . A perlator in the faucet so overgrown with stone that the water just doesn't go into the sink. Similarly with the shower. The heater could not be regulated, so the window was open, so the noise from the street. Generally I do not recommend it."
5984,"As Dr Tabaszewska explains, low molecular weight proteins can penetrate through the skin to its deeper layers. In this way they influence skin hydration and nourishment. On the other hand, proteins of high molecular weight remain on the skin surface. A thin but tight layer of the cosmetic, so called occlusal film, prevents water loss. Properly moisturized skin looks healthier and younger, there are fewer wrinkles and those that can be seen are shallower. Thanks to their specific structure, proteins can form various forms affecting the stability of the final product. This is important because cosmetics contain many different ingredients that affect and react to each other. The mixture, e.g. gel or cream, must maintain an appropriate solid consistency. Therefore, in the development of new cosmetics, researchers must combine the necessary substances in such a way as to obtain durable products with a specific structure. A big challenge for the Cracow team was the fact that the new emulsion containing whey protein concentrate consists only of natural resources. The natural raw materials are less standardized in comparison to synthetic substances, i.e. it is more difficult to determine the stable composition and proportions of the cosmetic."
5986,"At the end of August, the capital of Lower Silesia will be visited by eminent transplantologists, among others, the forerunner of the face and hand transplants of prof .

5987,"After we were forced to visit this lady, due to the leave of the doctor, who is constantly looking after her son, I am terrified. Both the level of medical knowledge and personal culture. It has never happened to me before that the doctor raised his voice on my child, in my presence, and on me - his mother only because she had already received many patients that day, she was delayed and there were still several children waiting for her. Inability or unwillingness to explain my son's ailments confirmed my opinion about the lack of professionalism. Fortunately, there are other allergologists whose advice I advise to seek. I sincerely and kindly discourage Mrs. Karbownicka! ! ! ! !"
5990,"She got a room with dirty and scratched walls. The TV can have three Polish channels and an additional attraction . . . . snow ! ! ! Such poor reception that you could only see the dots on the screen. The skirting board was peeled off with paint, in the bathroom on the ceiling, damp blisters on the floor, the cabin door did not close. At the washbasin, such a short spout from the battery, with each use flooded the whole top with water. There is no shampoo, body lotion or hairpiece, which is standard in other 4-star hotels. The walls in the corridors are scratched and stripped of paint. No technical lift, the staff ride the same lifts as guests. The best were bathrobes: ) The husband's bathrobe in size XL reached over his knees; and his sleeves barely covered his elbows, it was a shame to go to the pool. The water in the pool was cold, the jacuzzi was broken in the middle part, where the water flows out of the lack of a protective cap, which caused my foot to pull in painfully and ripped off the skin. Wet cold saunas, in the dry sauna shouted company from Israel. Dinner is fat, all tasteless, broth is a greasy suspension without salt, pepper, parsley, carrots. Husband asked for maggi, the waitress answered that she absolutely will not bring. The dumplings tasteless, fish with dry bemara, to drink only water and tea, no juices. She left me a hair straightener in the bathroom, after a few days she called me at the hotel asking if they could send it back to me. . . . . .unfortunately, she got a leg, somebody appropriated it. . . . .embarrassment. Far from the center of Zakopane, about 3km. The ski lifts at the hotel are a typical donkey of a children's ridge. I'm not going to bother with such luxury for 700 PLN a day. Absolutely not recommended. The only cover of this evening was a performance of the band Dżem, tickets, of course, additionally paid 50 zł / wasps for hotel guests. Opinions on booking about the hotel are fantastic, the hotel selects the positive ones and presents them on the customer news page, negative removes, so a potential customer looking for a hotel has no reliable picture of the place."
5991,"Mr. Doctor's very nice. But I can't believe the women are putting themselves under a hammer without establishing the final effect. I got a nose drawn on a piece of paper with a ballpoint pen and was supposed to stand in front of the mirror, squeeze my nose and see the effect. . . : . . .okay. Either I don't care what happens or I'm supposed to trust that we understand each other. Well, I guess that's not the time."
5992,"English Could be Female is not very demanding, it does not make big problems with passing. You have to write 2 colloquia, rarely seem to be the pieces of paper. However, the activities were not thrilling or too interesting, so I do not fully recommend this lady. However, if someone wants to do a stress-free course, it's very important: )"
5993,"I chose this hotel because of its Platinum status in Accor's loyalty program and it was a good choice. Checking in was quick, and in a room of a higher standard there was a surprise waiting for me to greet and invite me for a free drink. The room itself could have been a bit bigger, but it had everything that I needed. Well, almost everything - the iron and ironing board had to be asked for. The furniture in the room is not fully thought out: the so called desk is very shallow, it is difficult to work with it; there is also no place to eat, because the table is low and there is no way to sit with it. However, the armchair is ideal for relaxation. The room is very quiet. Wifi network is fast for hotel standards. They used 'em for dinner - delicious food at reasonable prices, buffet breakfast at a good level, although the whole thing is not organized (breakfast from 6.30, at 6.40 only some products were taken away). The only real inconvenience is the streets around the hotel, but you can't blame the hotel for that."
5994,"She was at Mr. DOCTOR's today (I write it in capital letters with a clear heart) and I will tell you, ladies and gentlemen, if you read this, that she has never met a better gynaecologist in her life, and she has already been at several. Mr. DOKTOR was very nice, especially gentle and patient. His office also testifies to his professionalism, because I have never been in such an office, where there are disposable slippers and skirts so we do not parade with the naked buttocks around the office. . This is a LESSON from a real vocation, I recommend him very, really worth it."
5995,"Maybe they're trying during the season, but outside it's a failure. After 20 you won't eat anything, after 22 you can forget about drinking anything as well as about entering the hotel, because the doors are simply closed like in a colony resort. The pool and spa are also closed. To be clear, the hotel next door, which does not have so many stars, does not do so. Maybe you should take these stars away from them so that they can learn to treat the client like the neighbors do. I strongly advise against it! ! !"
5996,"PLUSSES: very good food (none of the European hotels had better food), great alcohol (the drinks and wine list saw no end of it), receptionists and bartenders speak English very well, the service is polite and funny (of course in the positive sense of the word :)). The reservation of the pool seats (at 8:30 a.m. the pool opens at the latest by this hour you must have a place on a deckchair or else you will be lying in the sun in the middle of the ""square"" all day long.) The beach in front of the hotel was paid for (it seems to me that the travel agency informed about the free hotel beach and, as it turned out, you have to pay 10 euros for two sun loungers and an umbrella). The deposit for towels on the beach (10 euros for the whole stay) As for the stay itself, I believe that the hotel is still worth recommending, however, ideal for families with children. We flew in at the end of August to avoid large occupancy, but it turned out that we were not the only ones who thought this way ; ) A lot of French and Americans . Lots of animation for children and adults. In the hotel, the possibility of renting a car and bikes, but I think that in a town 2 km away from the facility prices are much lower for rent. Close to the airport - transfer about 20 minutes and what about it? A lot of flying machines over our heads ; ) Airplanes start flying from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. also seemingly bearable, but at some point (around noon) their traffic intensifies a lot. It is worth to visit the island in a hired car, but to make it run smoothly you need to familiarize yourself with the topography because one day to go around everything without knowing the area is not enough. A good starting point, we are located on the half of the island where both up and down we have about 60 km. All this information is of course my and my husband's feelings ; )"
5997,"Igor Kaczmarczyk , a graduate of the III High School in Warsaw. Igor Kaczmarczyk, a graduate of the 3rd High School of the Polish Navy in Gdynia, was inspired by a text by the English encyclopaedist Ephrain Chambers from 1728. ""During the plague epidemic those who worked in the extraction and processing of amber in Königsberg were never infected"" - he recalls. At work,"" Amber the Second. A study of the effects of extracts of fossil and subphosphate resins and 1, 4-butanediic acid on selected microorganisms "" the young scientist showed that the active substances obtained from Baltic amber (and other fossil resins such as Mexican amber, Canadian chalky amber, gedanite and Colombian fossil) could combat pathogenic bacteria such as staphylocococcus aureus without harming beneficial intestinal microorganisms. Particularly strong compounds include 1 , 4-butanediic acid . Potentially it would be possible to develop therapeutic agents and dressings on the basis of the substances described in the project - believes the author ."
5998,"With my children (10 years old and 2 years old) I actually only go to doctor. I think that she is a great specialist, she does not treat the patient ""from above"", she is nice, factual and well remembers and knows her little patients. She has an excellent attitude towards children and they like her very much. She does not prescribe immediately, sometimes without any sense, an antibiotic, only when it is necessary. A few times I happened to get to another pediatrician, but as a rule I was not satisfied. I'm glad that the doctor is working in my clinic. When he leaves, I'll have trouble choosing another pediatrician. I highly recommend it!"
5999,"With the first pregnancy I have no objections to Dr. Sujkowski everything was ok. However, with the second pregnancy I was very disappointed with this doctor, maybe at the beginning he gave a lot of referrals for tests but now it turns out that I have some kind of inflammation consulted m with a urologist my results and the urologist said that you need an antibiotic because otherwise the baby can be born with low birth weight and when she called me the attending doctor said it was nothing. I don't want to risk my baby's health."
